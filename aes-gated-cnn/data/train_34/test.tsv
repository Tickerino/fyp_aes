1	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lact of information on were to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go.  	1	1		1																					
3	3	Everyone travels to unfamiliar places. Sometimes we get lost and ask locals for directions which @MONTH1 not be a good idea. The setting affected the cyclist. He had a perfectly good map but asked older men who look like they haven�t been out in ages. The old men apparently haven�t been out because they gave the cyclist the wrong directions.  My advice would be to not listen to anyone no matter their age if you have a perfectly good map with you. Also try to know where you are going at all times. �Yes, sir!	1	1		1																					
6	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. For instance, it was extremely hot and dry. Also it  was nearly deserted, almost all of the places he crossed were deserted .A  lost her features of the setting were a ram shackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that caldnt hald in the lamest move.an is the feature give you an idea if haw the cyclist feels.  	1	1		1																					
7	3	The cyclist was riding through a tower when he stopped for directions. These old men told him to take a short cut and he did and got lost. He was in a ghost town in the desert. In conclusion the desert is hot.	1	1		1																					
8	3	The affects of the cyclist is if it does not change. it cut hurt a lot of people feeling because they @CAPS1 don�t care about the cyclist. I�m one of them people who does not care about it cause it does not affect me or anyone I know. It is a big deal to write people, some of them @CAPS1 blow stuff up. They talking on tiv and on the radio making all this stuff they say is made up. I don�t believe to I see it. That @CAPS1 not for black people because it has not did anything to us. We really don�t care about the affects of the cyclist.	0	0		0																					
14	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Initially, when the cyclist went through the road with the big snake in the middle of it made him keep cations and very unease. Furthermore, the desert and nothing around gave the cyclist of abandoness and no help for when he is I trouble. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and that people are there. The features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride.	1	2		2																					
25	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time geting to Yosemite National Park. This is because the sun was out, and it was in the middle of June. I was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day. When the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, �somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills"", which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road."	2	2		2																					
26	3	The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old men�s help, and doesn�t seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next �town� he hits doesn�t have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasn�t further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief.	3	3		3																					
31	3	The features of this setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting is a dessert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated. And when he is on his low of water because it is dry into mouth gets drys. @CAPS2 because he is in the dessert he sees wild sometime dangerous animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously @CAPS1 diamondbrock snake, which I believe are venomous, @CAPS2 �because � of the extreme heat of the dessert he realizes that he had ??? chance of dropping from heatstroke. @CAPS2 the writer said that the dessert had short rolling hills and rough road ahead ??? would leave worn the cyclist out. Because of this terrain the cyclist way affects.	1	1		1																					
37	3	The features in the story great effect the cyclist. One feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat. At first, the story says that the pine trees cooled the cyclist, but eventually the forest turned into a desert, and the heat poured down on him, make it hard to cycle. Another feature that effected the cyclist was the lack of water. As he moved away from his beginning point, the cyclist was drinking lots of water. But when he needed to refill, the water was brown and hot, so the cyclist didn�t take any. The lack of water plus the heat formed one giant obstacle that potentialy could have killed him, but through great determination the cyclist got through this troubling time.	2	2		2																					
40	3	The features of the settings affect in the story �Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit� it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart. Then..leaves and see these wide bunch of hills. inconclusion I would never do all the riding he did.  	1	2		2																					
47	3	Some of the features of the setting affect the cyclist like the road was bad it had bumps all over that made it much harder and it also took up a lot of strength. Also the neighborhood of two hundre degrees after that become to a road with arore bunch of hills	1	1		1																					
48	3	"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. �This sight was troubling� when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. �At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1�s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.� He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.    "	3	3		3																					
67	3	The cyclist was well prepaired for his adventure however hot enuff for a change in senary. When the old men told him to take a difficult path and did his in tire setting changed for the worst. After this he was nearly over powered by devastating hills and dehydration was slowly creeping up on him as well. He had not nearly packed enuff water or supplies for a change such as that and he would regret it later. The Hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and mercilous mankind it even worse on him. This is how the change of setting affected the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
77	3	In this story the cyclist is going through a desert of California. This is a reason why he is very limited on water supply. It is really hot which would cause him to drink a lot more water. He had started his journey in the morning so that the sun wasn�t as hot as it would be in the middle of the day. Then it started to get a lot more sonny. So with the sun comes more heat. The rider says �The sun was beginning to beat down.� This would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was. This was in the morning so he didn�t realize it but as it got into the afternoon he realized it and started to get dehydrated. 	2	2		2																					
78	3	The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author. The affect was bad rather that good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoltering temperatures. Another feature that had a great impeidence on the author�s well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbed across at the snack. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when author tried to get water. There was also Brackish water in the that tasted suspiciously like Battery acid.	1	1		1																					
79	3	"The cyclist is traveling through a rough part of California during the hot month of June. The author describes part of part of his journey; ""I was traveling through the high deserts of california in june."" The heat of the sun and not much water around is causing the cyclist to worry about his health. A little further into his journey realizes how bad he could get if he doesn't find water soon. The author write, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke. ""As the cyclist has run out of water & there is no sign of life around, he begins to feel that he @MONTH1 never make it through the desert to yosemite National Park.The author describes this ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. ""The setting of the cyclist""s journey greatly affected how he percieved his journey."	3	3		3																					
85	3	"In ""rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Many visual features create a very deserted area thats hott in your head. For example in paragraph five they use alot of adjectives to describe how abandon the place was. Words like ramshackle and rusty. Also how often the lack of water was brung up made us think of how hott this California desert must have been. Also the heat made the cyclist belive he was seeing a miracle when he saw the Welch�s fruit juice factory. The choice of visual words in this story are words to describe what affected the cyclist."	1	2		2																					
87	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, �Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.�	2	2		2																					
89	3	The features that affected the cyclist was plenty of things. One thing would be lack of water. In the text he said the pump gave water that taste like battery acid. Another one would be all the surroundings changed from what the old men sald and he got lost. When he was lost he had to have determination to find someone say that he could survive.   	1	1		1																					
95	3	The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn�t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn�t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch�s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination.	2	1		2																					
106	3	There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, �several rusty bumps,� is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn�t riding on smooth ground he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also he had a huge lack of water he was water depleted he couldn�t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. �Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,''  this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehidrated, and very tired.	3	2		3																					
107	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonist�s problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June, � and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because � The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.� @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. 	3	3		3																					
109	3	The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn�t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
112	3	There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	1		1																					
113	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" affect the cyclist. First of all, the weather causes most of his problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a california desert in June the temperature had to be in the @NUM1's. This causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly"" The heat therefore causes the cyclist to drive excessively and run out of water, also, the objects the cyclsit comes across on his journey affect him. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This saves the biker progress and most likely scared him. The cyclsit is greatly affected by the features in the story setting."	2	3		3																					
116	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him.	1	1		1																					
120	3	The setting of the essay didn�t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, �a ghost town.� @CAPS1 this couldn�t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is �traveling through the deserts of California in June.� Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels.	3	2		3																					
127	3	"In the stories, don�t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      "	3	3		3																					
128	3	The author had to bike through extremely hot weather. This made him feel sweat a lot. The narration states, �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt� (@NUM1). This caused him to drink water until he ran out. The narration states, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips� (@NUM1). He then had to suck on pebbles which he could have choked on. The narration states, �With any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat�(@NUM1).	1	1		1																					
130	3	"The features of the setting affects he cyclist. One way it affect the cyclist is it by being hotlike a says in the text""I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgerous day in June ""@CAPS1 way it affects the cyclist by being bumby like it says in the text ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" that is how the setting affects the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
139	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Ti�s better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing what�s going to happen next.	1	1		1																					
164	3	Many different things affected on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a �ghost town� there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, directions he was given, and lack of water. When the cyclist come across the bait shop he know he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and water.	2	2		2																					
169	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist. The setting takes place in June. It is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated. You can imagine how hot it got when it said, �wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage.� It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down	2	1		2																					
172	3	In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions were from elder men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to decide which way to take when there was a fork in the road. He chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into flat roads that went to rolling hills, snakes blocking his path, and a dehydration state that could�ve killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
175	3	The affect of the setting are two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert since carter was in office. It was starting to become daylight and he  had to walk @NUM1 miles to get to the next town. So he gets on a bike and rides to the next town. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour and he  was going 12 miles per hour just like the waterflow. He was riding up and down rolling hills. He finally got to the next town to live.	1	2		2																					
182	3	The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.� This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration.	2	1		2																					
192	3	The features in the setting are very effective to the cyclist. He is in a desert area of California and he has limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry. He barely had an water to drink and he had to go a long way in the hot and humid weather. The deficiency of water could have made him became dehydrated. Another obstacle that he had during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park was the hills that he faced. At the beginning, he was on flat terrain, now he has hills that he has to pedal up that makes it a lot harder for him. One other obstacle that he faced was the snake he ran into. That setting had many obstacles for this guy. If it wasn't for the heat and lack of water, he might have been able to make it a little easier.	1	1		1																					
196	3	The setting had a huge affect on the cyclist. One affect was the lack of water in the area he was in, which was a dessert. Also, the lack of people in the area didn�t help the cyclist out at all. The hills on the road made it more tougher on the cyclist because it drashed what little energy he had left. Also, the sun beating down on him made his body more warm and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do.	1	2		2																					
198	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when the old guy had told him do you know where to go? An the other guy was like � yes sir! I own a very good map� so how did it change for the man that was riding this bike he saw all of those towns an a sign that said Rough Road ahead. That the man would always stick to the future. What had change was he saw all of those buildings, town, an he was going an going. I think he might stick with the future.	1	1		1																					
203	3	The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to �short, rolling hills�. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but �tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.� He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless. 	2	3		3																					
226	3	In the essay �Do not exceed posted spedd limit� by @PERSON1 many features of the setting effect the cyclist. First, when he arrived at the first �town� and said, �this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time � say, before the last world war.� This deserted ghost town setting was like a joke and had a small effect on the cyclist because it was the beginning of the day and he still had a good water supply. Though when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps the effect it had wasn�t so mild. He says, �The sight was troubling.� Then when he got on his hands and knees and started working the pump the situation didn�t get much better. All that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid. Lastly, when he arrived at an abandoned welch�s Grape juice factory after several miles. This had a very wearing effect on him since the water supply was low and he had cycled into disappointment after disappointment. This setting in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless. It was only determination that got this cyclist through it.	1	1		1																					
227	3	The story �Do not exceed posted speed limit is about a cyclist who got bad direction to Yosemite National Park and has a depleeding water supply is extreme heat. He is doubtful that he will make is journey because he is dehydrated and dizzy.	2	2		2																					
231	3	This cyclist had the conditions of the land to deal with, He didn�t have too much water with him and there wasn�t a good source anywhere near him that he could see. He just had to keep going. He also talked about how the road was rough. This was conflicting on how long it took him to get to the next place with water. More over he was in a desert area. The air was dry and hot, the heat was making him sweat and that was leading him to become dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
234	3	It the short story �Rough Rode Ahead� a cyclist is pushed through an extremely harsh setting  trying to get to Yosemite National Park. In the story the narrator takes a trip to Yosemite National park after getting directions from two older men what the narrator doesn't know is that the road ahead is indeed rough. One narrator states �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated @NUM1). The narrator is really really taking a beating from the travel and this rocks, dry climate is really takens a tale. From reading this story the setting does not do any good for him other than the general store he finds in the end. Like the title states the setting of this story was a �Rough Road Ahead.�	2	2		2																					
235	3	The setting affect the cyclist features because if the cyclist was riding in @LOCATION1 around june the affect @MONTH1 not had been that harsh. But overall the setting out begin in a hot place with limited water was not a good thing. That�s how the cyclist is affected by the setting.	1	1		1																					
239	3	The setting was affecting the character, because as the day got hotter he got thirtier. Also because when he got to the sign about rough roads ahead. He started to get worried and kinda paranoid, so that�s how the setting affected him.	1	1		1																					
240	3	There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town there wasn�t any real water he could drink. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty. Also, it�s the middle of June in California, it�s very hot and size and the is going to wear him out pretty quickly. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says �Over one long, crippling hill�, he�s saying the hills are very hard for him. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story.	2	1		2																					
242	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn�t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
245	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who haven�t seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldn�t have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldn�t have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his �dehydrated state.� I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldn�t focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldn�t get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite.	3	2		3																					
250	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very serious way. The features cause him to consider he @MONTH1 die soon, as well as present a variety of challenges to him. The setting takes place in the deserts of California, in early summer. There are no other people in there, no establishments, towns, etc. ; @CAPS1 dangerous feature of the setting in addition to it being in a desert in summer, for example the author is the town learntedat �might have been a thriving little spot at one time-sat, before the last world war�. The cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water. For example he says �I was going to lie�slowly gaining elevation while losing hope�. The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives. He lerns, because the setting the setting is now lifeles and deserted, to not listen to old people who remember the current setting on if as it was many decades earlier. Because the features of the setting nearly kill the cyclist, the cyclist learns a lesson. 	3	2		3																					
257	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the mans ride gets pretty rough. Because he took the old mens advice on a shortcut, the once enjoyable ride became a  "	1	1		1																					
263	3	This story was a great motivation for older man that can still be healthy and feel like an teenager again. It showed how much effort he put to his goal and how he survive. Forty miles he peddled for forty miles to drink same water the cyclist was and interesting story not ginaupup	1	1		1																					
267	3	"The features of the setting affect the cy clist in many ways. For example the lack of water was the biggest thing. Without cool water he had nothing to reboost his energy. He would get tired out faster. Even he does find water its hot, like when he says,� brakish water feeling some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This shows how in �the high desert of June,"" the water is all very hot. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes the water still wouldn�t cool down the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot. Also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it. We know the roads rough when he says, �large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. ""This also shows you couldn�t go fast."	3	2		3																					
272	3	"The cyclist surrounds did have an affect. In paragraph two the cyclist describes how �I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening the."" To have a wonderful day to begin with was parably assurance even thing would be fine. Confidence was a factory for the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut. In paragraph @NUM1 the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out �this breezy jaunt.� The cyclist just thought his life got a little easier. Then in paragraph @NUM2 the cyclist comes upon the ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This setting was nothing like the old men were talking about. ""Twenty miles up the road, i came to a fork of sorts."" In paragraph @NUM3, this caused confusion and worry. ""This sight was troubling."" ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclist was ""hitting my water bottles pretty regularly."" This setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the ""two hundred degrees."" The cyclist then began puzzled and distraught. ""I notices the terrain changing"" in this quote the cyclist's settings @MONTH1 have caused confusion. But in the end the cyclist suceeded. "	2	3		3																					
275	3	"When the cyclist takes off on the road again he has plenty of water, strongs legs and enjoys the sunny and warm day. But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and cough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence, as he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terain he says,"" i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the queruring that he says,"" i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�. This shows that by this time his confidecnce was lost because of the insane heat and unberable terrain. He begins to lose  his sanily along with his strength because the setting around him was so terrible."	2	3		3																					
276	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. �I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. �This site was trebling.�  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn�t good. �A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees�. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he can�t believe his luck.� Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me �The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks.	3	2		3																					
298	3	As if along bike ride through the city isn�t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. �High deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good.	3	2		3																					
299	3	The features that affect the cyclist is the lack of water he slows. Another is the directions from the old men that probably aren�t up to date nowadays.	1	1		1																					
303	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, �This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I�d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, �conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.� It made him think the situation wasn�t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																					
304	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, �Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven�t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. �This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se � a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
308	3	There were many features of the setting that affect he cyclist to make his difficut journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise. For example, �I followed their advice and launched out at first line, nd along a �short cut� that was toslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.� This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed @CAPS1, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate. For example, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death. For example �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June�� This is stating without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die.  	2	3		3																					
311	3	The conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist. The conditions were that, he had to save as much water as possible and keep himself hydrated at the same time so that he wouldn�t dehydrate himself.The features of the desert like land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there. You can never predict what they�ll do.	2	1		2																					
312	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when he arrived to the first town the water had tasted like battery acid which made the rider concerve water another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature. The ride would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster.	1	1		1																					
313	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn�t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
315	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie�s, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""This sentence from the text stores he is dehydrated, because of this it creates an obstacle he must face. Also, another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is, the rough road ahead he had to face. �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign I would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead. Luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well."	2	1		2																					
319	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope and nearly lead him to his death.	1	1		1																					
321	3	Whether the lack of water, the hills, the tumble weeds � all are things that affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water. The hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills. Finally is the tumbleweeds. The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look. When he sees tumble weeds he try�s to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn�t want to crash. The dehydration / lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive. When you are lack of water and energy it makes your goal more hard to complete.  	2	2		2																					
322	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, �I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved @NUM1). Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a �ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, �Telling myself that of I could make it that far, I�d be @NUM3). The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
325	3	I believe the cyclist is a alone, and I think the old man should have shot him. I believe a bike ride that long is a little retarded. I feel that no matter how great or horrible the shape your in you should even go on a realling long rider on a bicycle.	1	1		1																					
335	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. For example, the author states �looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. For instance in the text, �it didn�t really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.� This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. He would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.	3	2		3																					
339	3	There are many ways in which the setting of �Rough Road ahead� affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a problem because it is very dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� It is obvious here that lack of water is affecting his in a big way. He almost collapsed because he is so thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Since there was rolling now, the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop. Lastly, the �rough road� affected the cyclist. The road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so I could renew my energy. The heat, remotness of the area, and the rough road all affected the cyclist on his journey. 	2	1		2																					
340	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly in the story. The list desert climate tales damage onto the cyclist by quickly depleting his water supply. He also began to get worried when every town the old men told about turned out to be a ghost town. This crawled doubt in the cyclist mind that he might not survive the �shortcut� told off by the old men.  	1	1		1																					
342	3	@CAPS1   the  story  the  condition of  problem  often effected the mood of the cyclist . For  example when the sign said ,” Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.” @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated . The dry and hot climate began to become problem for the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
345	3	The features of the setting afect the cyclist in many ways. If he wasn�t in �High deserts of California in June� he probaly wouldn�t be dehydrated if he was in @DATE1 it wouldn�t be so hot out. Also if there weren�t �short rolling hills� he would have had more energy. As you can see setting affects the cyclist a lot.	1	1		1																					
352	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, �sometimes life can feel so cruel�, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, �somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey"	3	3		3																					
356	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by letting the author have hope . When he came across a sign which read ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, his hope was faint because he was doing a water-depleting @NUM1 per hour. Because of the rate of the water, he felt life was cruel sometimes and he thought that he was at the point of losing water. Also when he came across the tumbleweeds and the large snake he tried to avoid them. If he would have been bitten he would have died. Finally because of the heat he might have also did from the heatsroke ""wide signs  of   dried""       "	2	2		2																					
357	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�many features of the setting challenge the cyclists.The cyclist accepts information from foreign old people which made his first mistake.After realizing this he,�I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,and i was traveling through the high deserts of California,in June�the lack of water plus the heat in California,in june would have turned to heatstroke for most people.Even further into the journey,even with all those things against him it states,�flat rode was replaced by short,rolling hills,""@CAPS1 not only did he have excessive heat,and no water,but @CAPS1 he was handed troublesome rodes too.Although the cyclist must have been near to complete exhaustion,he continued through.Fighting all adds,and elements,many features in the setting of this story affected the cyclist,but he overcame them honorably."	3	2		3																					
362	3	"The story Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclist�s mood was detirmined by the setting as well as his needs and his detirmination to make it. The setting of the story early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of @CAPS1 can June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men�s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his detirmination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he�d] be fine."" @CAPS2 for the cyclist, the settings affect was negitive.     "	3	2		3																					
365	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in @LOCATION1 in he middle of June he wouldn�t of gotten so dehydrated. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to @NUM1� degrees. In the middle of @DATE2 in @CAPS1.A it bearly reaches @NUM2� degrees. Also the desert is know to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in �No @CAPS2�s @CAPS3�. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels.	1	1		1																					
380	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly was incorrect and he got lost. The lack of water led to the possibility to sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst. The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy.These were the affects the setting had to the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
398	3	The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all he rides into barren land. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying �it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This was in response to the first �town� he came across. Next he speaks of a large snake that came close to him which is dangerous, but luckily he manuvers out of its way. But the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water. This is a threat to any living creature. But in the end he found some water and the story ended fine.	2	2		2																					
405	3	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, �short, rolling hills�, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isn�t much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble.	2	2		2																					
406	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road. Lostly, seeing the old welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right infront of you but not business has to make them fell like he/she will never make it. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
408	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel�. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. � From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part.	2	2		2																					
423	3	In the essay the cyclist is riding in the desert. It is extremely hot out because it�s June and that causes alot of problems for him. He said that since it was so hot he was afaid of getting dihydrated. Also he explains that the roads were getting hilly, which would have caused him to work harder, meaning he was lossing my water.	2	2		2																					
424	3	The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first �town�, he could tell there�d be some issue. It was a deserted, run down area. The water was hot. Down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills. There was a big snake in the road. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water.	2	2		2																					
429	3	Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.	2	2		2																					
436	3	Setting can affect a cyclsit in many ways. Just as I read in the story, being in a desert dehidrated him. It was hot, the road was bumpy and the dangers of poisnous snakes. The cycclist could have died in many ways such as: heatstroke, falling of his bike, dehidration, and a bite form snake. Say ??? in the mountains of ???.There are many problems that face you there.	1	1		1																					
437	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, the high deserts of California affected him. Also, �Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change.� For example flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then after over coming that, �A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,� �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55. Last the author says, �Sometimes life can feelso cruel. In conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
451	3	Don�t let anything stop you with your goals. Going to Yosemite National Park. Takes a status that would out home off side. Forty miles into the trys comes to a town. Got to a water station and get nothing because old men say �the water taste like buttery acid. Lead going to hills and azyl towns, @CAPS1 can be rod without anything to drink. People die  from heatatacks because they don�t  sits and take herats for water and food.	1	1		1																					
454	3	Each person has a really good ability that stands out. Someone can be good looking, smart or confident. Someone @MONTH1 never give up and do what he wishes to do. The cyclist in the story is or man with a strong will. He wants to be alive. He saw too many difficult in his way to get the place he wanted to be. He listened to some old guys and he lost his way. The sun was beginning to beat down. He was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal. He was losing his strength. The weather  was @NUM1�@CAPS1.The  water  tasted  like  acid battery. He  believed  himself  that he can be alive. He got stronger by believing in himself eventhough he was losing strength. Every place that he passed by was a new experienced for life. They were like a game that he came successful. He never give up. He did everything he could do to not losing his mind. He didn�t want lose the battle in his mind.   	2	3		3																					
458	3	The features of the setting been amajor affect of this cyclist  in the  story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but think is a lot like and winding. The cyclist also comes across bumps, non-paved roads that make it hard to meneuver through. Then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story.         	2	1		2																					
466	3	The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men�s �town� was now abandoned. ��(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled�� This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When �a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a �sad, hopeless laugh.� The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water.	3	3		3																					
474	3	The humid climate and hot weather will want to make you keep over if you don�t have water in your possesion. Like near the end of the essay the person sucked on stones to try retain water better which never heard about it its time. This weather is the cause of the character ??? dihydration which is a symptom of lack of water in the body.	1	1		1																					
480	3	The features in the setting of this story affect the cyclist very much so. Throughout this story this poor person has to get lost and end up in the middle of nowhere. By her being out her cycle was being affected. She was just trying to get somewhere and get things done, but of course she didn�t. She kept moving on down. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it bad.	1	1		1																					
481	3	In this story, the cyclist had to ride threw the desert, during june and with little water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates alot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him. Personally I don�t know what he was doing ride threw the dessert by himself, and that�s his problem.	2	2		2																					
495	3	There are many features in the setting that affect the cycleist, one of which is that he is in the middle of California riding his bike in the sun with a limited ammount of water. It affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
497	3	The cyclist had very little water. It was very hot. He had a long way to go. The road was very bumpy so he couldn�t go to fast or he�s tire�s might bust. There were know cars in site so if he did break down it would have taken even longer.	1	1		1																					
502	3	The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective.� and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don�t have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
506	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with �His name written over them�. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. �That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map.	3	3		3																					
511	3	The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn�t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay.	2	2		2																					
513	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welch�s Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,� describes the cyclist, �but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the �shortcut.� �Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,� reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, � By the looks of it- had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory.� The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.  	3	3		3																					
515	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. It stated, �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was  pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along. Also it stated,� At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down. There was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy.	2	2		2																					
522	3	In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in.	2	1		2																					
535	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).� This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his �shortcut� his running out of water. That�s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men.	2	2		2																					
537	3	Setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition. If the road condition is bad then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night. If it is night, they must be careful due to cars not being able to see them. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous to cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water.	1	1		1																					
538	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn�t prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the �high deserts of colifornia in June� I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a �ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back� That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to �ease post� it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was �replaced by short, rolling hills� which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?"	3	3		3																					
541	3	First the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem. That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn�t trust the guy. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desteart road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn�t attack him. Finally the biker faced his  las long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water.	2	2		2																					
542	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are �cool pines and rushing rivers,� however, the cyclist comes to find that the �rushing river� is not so refreshing. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills. There is a sign, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which cause him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him he�d be better off using his map.	2	1		2																					
546	3	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he/she thought they would die. The setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat. Finally the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men because the cyclist didn�t make it where he/she wanted to go.	2	2		2																					
548	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him. You know he was hot where it said �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.�	1	1		1																					
551	3	The setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike. He was smiling and his legs were strong. As he hit the @NUM1 town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water. As the flat rodes were replaced wI short, rolling hills he became even more troubled.  When he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to Yosemite. As the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless. But when he saw the man he became happy b/c the map was going to help him.	2	2		2																					
552	3	The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn�t get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few �tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge,� By the lols of it had been a Welch�s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory.� He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a �Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.� There is only the problems it is abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth. This was to help tabe his mind off being thirst.	3	2		3																					
559	3	The features of the setting affect the setting affect the cyclist by. Dehydrating him due to the heat and lack of water and to see mirages. And he loses strength going over the many hills. And there is a very large snake he has to ride by that could have bitten him.	1	1		1																					
562	3	In the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed limit� a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The rode he is rideing on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there but	2	2		2																					
566	3	Heat, hills and ghost towns � all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, the heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke. He starts dinking more often, and nearly runs out of water. Next is the hills. They can take massive amounts of energy to climb. Which adds to his dehydration. Finally the ghost towns. They make his journey seem hopeless. Which could cause him to lose the will to carry on.	2	2		2																					
568	3	In the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the author tells a story about when he took advice from �old folks� and became lost. The setting greatly affected him and his journey, for example �tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake�� and a �crippling hill� these quotes explain that the setting was quite scary.	1	1		1																					
580	3	The character in this short story has a most that changes with his surroundings. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said �� The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,�� As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher.	1	1		1																					
585	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the �high desserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. �I could drop from a heatstroke,� he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist�s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. �Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact.	3	3		3																					
592	3	The features oF the bike ride to Yosemite through California in June affect the cyclist. Some of the features were it was hot high deserts, and no water. This affected the author by making him dehydrated and tired, which made it hard for him to find water or to get to Yosemite. In this cass the outhor says �The sun was beating down on me�. The author is hot From the sun. He says �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips�. He is showing how he hasno water and is probably dehydrated. All of those features are affecting the way he is traveling and getting to water.  	2	2		2																					
599	3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� are pretty dangerous. �a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips� (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn�t an expert on snakes because he couldn�t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey.	3	2		3																					
602	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist is tired and thirsty already. The features include a desert like setting of California, it is extremely hot, there are no signs of civilization in sight, and the roads are like hills that always were throughout the desert. On top of those facts the cyclist is dehydrating because his water suposely has diminished. 	1	1		1																					
603	3	"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
605	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into �short, rolling hills,� These hills are increasing the difficulty and are causing him doubt that he will make it. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The horizon was what kept cyclist going. �I began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine.� The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it.	3	2		3																					
612	3	When your with your family in ocean city biking down the board walk your only obstacle is people. When your in a race on whinedy roads you could have lots of obstacles. The wheather could be your greatest obstacle. You could pass out by lack of water and scorcing heat. You could fall over by slippery roads from the rain. Along with that nature could lay its toll apon you. �a ridiculously large snake�blocked the majority of the pavement in front of @NUM1, Kurmaskie) @CAPS1 like a snake you don�t know what you could come across.	1	1		1																					
614	3	The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� Affect the cyclist in many ways. First in the essay when the @CAPS1 says he is in the deserts of California, that can affect because it gives them an idea of how hot it most likely was out there and how lack of water can really harm someone. Also when the @CAPS1 describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply.	2	2		2																					
615	3	"Many things in the setting of the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affected the cyclist throughout his journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a deserts without a good supply of water. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the length of his journey. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
617	3	In the story the features of setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn`t going to make it. When he finally got to �Gary & Wilber�s fish camp,� he learned a lesson because when an old man asked if he know the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map.''	2	2		2																					
618	3	In many real-life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest hindrance in succeeding, or even surviving. For example, the cyclist with stood the blozing heat of the sun as he pedaled through what seemed to be the @CAPS1�s living room: Dry, desolate, and extremely scornful. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� @CAPS2 and depicts the intense heats of the desert. Another feature in the setting was the every hanging hills and steps though pedaling down the hills was an easier task, traveling up the hill, as well  as maneuvering the thirsts and bends served as a direct conflict. An example, �with what I believed was my last burst of energy I maneuvered a setting affect a situation is ultimately, the cyclist reached his destination is great relief. But the biggest hindrance was along his setting.                        	3	3		3																					
620	3	First, by accepting the old mens� advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would, easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a �ghost town�, lifeless and most importantly, waterless. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like �battery acid�. Next he rides past a �Rough Road Ahead� sign; not the most encouraging thing on his journey. To add to the despair, he has to manever his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp. �To him, this simple bait shop was like  beacon of hope from food himself.	2	3		3																					
624	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, for example, the heat was unberable beating down on him during this long ride. The fact that he had no where around him to fill up his water bottle. So he was deing of thirst and he didn�t know where he was going or how far he had to go. The setting was crushal in this story.	1	1		1																					
627	3	The cyclist has to over come a lot of obstacles. For example, there is a snake in his path, so he cationly rides around it. Also, there are alot of hills and he wasn�t sure if he could make it up those hills. Furthermore, he is almost out of water so he could die of heatstroke or dehidration. In conclusion he over comes these obsticles and achieves his goal. 	2	1		2																					
628	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the author goes through many seneries. All of the places that the author goes to make him even more determined because he wants to find water and he just wants to get to Yosemite. The determination pushes him to keep going further and further. And then the determination finally pays off after he goes around a turn because he then see�s a place where he can get something to drink and a place to cool down.	2	1		2																					
632	3	The features of the cyclist is rough because of the hills, snakes, heat, amount of water. The hills give you a breeze going down but going up give you a hard time. The snakes can hurt you by bitting. The heat could make you sick. The amount of water can really hurt you by being dehydrated.	1	1		1																					
640	3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclists state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it is summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early @DATE1. And third he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together. He was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These @NUM1 things all contributed to the characters state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, that tasted like battery acid. He drank to much water at the begining which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough.	3	2		3																					
644	3	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again.	2	2		2																					
653	3	Setting  depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didn�t. The cyclist  got a bad idea or aditude when he saw the towns he was upset and mad he didn�t want to die and yet he though. He was going two. He said he wouldn�t trust old men anymore. They didn�t know where were talking about .How and why did he trust even in the first place.	2	2		2																					
663	3	At first he was mad because he took advise from old men who never left their porch. He got scared he was going to die because had he drunk all his water and he didn�t know how long it would be till he got some more. He shouldn�t have drank his water so quickly knowing he had a while to go. Then he became happy when he saw the bait sign. He biked quickly down the hill.  	1	1		1																					
665	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It made him become dehydrated. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 sentence @NUM2 he stated �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� This shows how the heat and climate of the setting affected him by how he was getting thrown off balance and wears     to him getting dehydrated. The setting of the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, effects the cyclist in the story.	1	1		1																					
668	3	because he was telling to make it wirte he nite to go and he much it because he was drieing to soil and because he was drieing 55 mph pert hour and 12 mph and sometime life can feel so cruel in life ya dig and that ia all I can said right now.	1	1		1																					
671	3	This essay is an american tale that express how hard it is to do someing. But do it thought determination. The cycle are faced with many change not onnly physically but also menataly. There was no one in sight not a building  or anything. As this rider come to think that the sabstatal beating he took from the ride he is tirde and no sight of baidi say he might not be able to do it.	1	1		1																					
675	3	In the essay �Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,� the cyclist is affect both positivly and negativly by the setting. Setting is the sounding in which the story tacks place. In the story a cyclist loses his way and band is put in to dangous because of it. The setting of the story can be dicrided as mountainous with many rolling hills. The author discride the setting by say �@CAPS1 two miles in to the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.� The change in terrain made it more difical for the cyclist. However he also used the land to give him hope that he was almost their. He told him self that he�d make it if he make it over the next hill. The setting of the story gave the cyclist hope and problems in his journy to sarive.	1	1		1																					
678	3	"In the short story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story. In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike. Being unware of where he is on his journey the setting begins to really affect him. For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that ""The sight was troubling."" As he continues to California in June the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. For example he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" The quote shows because he is biking so long is looking water and there is not a town is sight he becomes weak and although he is at terminated to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in. "	3	3		3																					
683	3	Features of the setting such as the hot sun, no water, and �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp,� greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high desserts of California in June, the temperature was really high and the hot sun left �wide rings of dried sweat� on his shirt and made the cyclist realize that he could drop from a heatstroke. Also, the fact that the only water around felt �somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees� and �had the flavor of battery acid� prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a �dehydrated state.� @CAPS1, �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp� affected the cyclist by solving his problem of dehydration, since there was cold water availible for him upon arrival.	2	2		2																					
688	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuious setting to have to bike with. I would never be able to do what he did.	1	1		1																					
691	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the people around the area of @LOCATION1. Taking advice from older people in open landed place can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
692	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� By Joe Kurmaskie the settings affected the cyclist by how hard his ride is. When the road was smooth He ride was fast when it was the hills it took him longer to get to the next town.	1	1		1																					
694	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. If the setting is dark trainy, there aren�t going to be ??? running outside. If it is snowing, the ??? are not going to be swimming in the water.	0	0		0																					
697	3	In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, �This sight was troubling,� he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, �It didn�t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die.	2	2		2																					
702	3	The cyclit of �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was �@NUM1 degers�. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would�ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story.	2	2		2																					
712	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if it�s raining or snowing it affects the cyclist because pavement can be wet and icy. Which causes the cyclist to slip and @DATE1 and the cyclist can really get injured. Also the cyclist has to wear a helmet if it�s very hot outside you wouldn�t see the cyclist in winter clothes. This would make the cyclist unfocus and the cyclist wouldn�t be able to finish any race.	1	1		1																					
716	3	The setting affected the cyclist by the people from Lodi get him into the wrong way and he had to survive from there so he that was very dry and No water or nothing to the next stop was at the bait store so he was determined to get to next stop destination by he did want to give up own but the guy ask him did he want direction he said he was not going to be fooled twice.	1	1		1																					
718	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left. The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town. The setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much.	2	2		2																					
726	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, �I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
731	3	The cyclist thought it was hard. Also he was upset that the old timers gave bad directions.	2	2		2																					
734	3	In this pasage the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been any were else he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the seting had botha lack of civillesation and water that he needed that caused him to almost faint of thirst. This is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist, �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.� This showes that had all the setting been paridice he would never learned anything.	2	1		2																					
736	3	The setting effects the cyclist very much. By the very dry climates	2	2		2																					
739	3	The story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was a rough undergoing story about a cyclist going though rough climate and terrain. In this story the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for about as far for human eyes could see. In paragraph @NUM1 the text says �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke.� is empressed how the climate felt. This explains the heat and how he felt during this experience. This whole trip sounds suffering.	1	1		1																					
741	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. They make it hard to concentrate, because its heat, they make it unbearable. The setting has the affect of drowsiness and thirst, �Dry bitter lnad, longing, longing.	1	1		1																					
745	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist by showing the rough conditions he went through, and somehow perservered through. The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the rolling hills. Followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This shows the struggle he went through and supports the setting story and how it affected his trip. This also shows how he perserverd through his struggles and made an effort to finish.	1	1		1																					
752	3	I think that the setting made him find more courage inside him self to save his water and go to the next town with out any water.	1	1		1																					
754	3	"As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that be lovers, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confidentin the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted.Though at first he laughs it off, he laster realizes just how much trouble he in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates. All there features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point.      "	3	3		3																					
760	3	"The setting will either effect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way. In the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie it affects the cyclist in a bad way and a good way. In the story, it continues to talk about lack of water. �When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery @NUM1). This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down. But a good way it affect them is pebbles. ""I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to @NUM2). This shows that even though he has no water the pebbles can make him less thirsty. This is how the setting affects the cyclist. In good way and a bad way."	1	1		1																					
769	3	Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he�s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old �codgers�  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.� Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        	3	2		3																					
773	3	The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he�s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted.	2	2		2																					
778	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that said �Rough Road Ahead� he was already low on water, but that made things much worse. The rough road made it harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working harder and getting thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some pebbles on the ground and shoved them in his mouth. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate�. Lastly, �GARY AND WILBER�S FISH CAMP�, could possibly have saved the cyclist�s life. He stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear. The setting and features severly affected the cyclist throughout his journey.  	2	2		2																					
779	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of he setting affect how the author feels. In the beginning of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is, �a reservoir camp ground outside at Lodi, California� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, �This sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, �Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me� (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The area the author goes through has an effect"	2	3		3																					
788	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. First since he was in a desert, the heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his journey to the parts. Also, the bumpy roads and rolling hills slowed the bike down to 12 mph since it was to extreme for him to handle at high speeds. When he sees the fist building because he fist is relived but soon after he loses all his hope because it is desserted. Even the old men that living in the area have an affect on the cyclist because they give him out-dated directions that almost @CAPS1 him. Because of this, he will probably rest first an old man�s short tentS again. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
790	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist thought that the journey he was about to go on was going to be a good one, but that soon changes. For example, �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porched since Carter was in office.� This quote tells how at first the cyclist thought his journey was going to be a good one, but getting information from two old men soon changed that. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.�  	1	1		1																					
791	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhausting. The heat @MONTH1 cause the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal. This is especially true in this case because of his lack of water. The cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke. The terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road. His muscle will start to ocha and his body will need water and rest. The story would totaly change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the @DATE1 on a cold day in the mid @NUM1 he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke. There would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything.	2	2		2																					
798	3	"There are many features in the story, ""that affect the roles, like out of waters, bad directions. The narrator is ??? and says, ""the water bottles container a few tantalizing sips..� it is say that there is hardly any water left , and he still have to keep going on, until he can find some In the story water is something he has to over come because he is out of it by the time he gets to the fish store."	1	1		1																					
805	3	The cyclist choose the worst time to ride his it was an �early summer evening� in California. At this time the sun is hot and with little water and also lost, it was hot the best choice that he made. A cyclist before do a trip he or she should be prepared for whether conditions and also check a map of the place before going anywhere. 	1	1		1																					
810	3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town he�s tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he�s tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He�s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is greatful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story the cyclists needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relived.	2	3		3																					
814	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the old guys had worn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. So the features affect reading the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very dangerous and unsafe for people to ride on.	1	1		1																					
821	3	"The setting acts as a catylist in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is always challenging the character untill the very end. In the story it says �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says �The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.� This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him it also shows how is risle he is, and how satiricle life can be. The ultimate @CAPS1 in this story is when he stumbels across the welches grape juice factory and there was a piture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.� No matter where the cycalist goes he is alway trying to overcome the elements."	2	3		3																					
831	3	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappoint, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally when he passes a portrin the road with nothing but a �ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral�� he becomes disturbed.  The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, �doing a water-deleting @NUM1.� The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, �ironic twist� the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist.	3	2		3																					
832	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit.� In the beginining when the cyclists had just begun his cycling cause he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says �the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. � When he says this the reader imagines someone in an ??? more excited as ??? ??? ??? ??? his destination on a dry day.  As the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what ?? ?? then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen when the cyclist says, �I wiped the swear from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage and that not to get too excited� the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall as the setting changes to �burning sun� and extremely hot, with a shortage of water the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upheat. For example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states �with only luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.� This shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting.	3	3		3																					
833	3	The raugher the road gets for him the more determination he has at the beginning towards the end he had the mind set that, �it didn�t matter it was going to die, �this took a toll on him and it was hard to go on. He realyed he didn�t want to die that way and so he kept on, eventually leading to civilisation.   	1	1		1																					
837	3	Many of the settings features affect the cyclist. One of the features of the dessert like, which is the setting, is the dry air and hot temperatures. This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, �I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.� @CAPS1 feature of the setting was the desolet towns that didn�t contain any water. This lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to sucking on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulates. @CAPS1 features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch�s Grape factory. This  factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state. The narrator called the factory.�Ironic  twist.�	3	3		3																					
840	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The bumpy roads. Sand in the eyes, thirst hit him too hot and humid tempures. Maybe he got tired of pedaling had to walk. A wild dog chased him went he got in town. Had no money to buy a drink	1	1		1																					
841	3	The cyclist of this story is greatly affected by the heat of his souroundings. While he riding to @CAPS1, the heat of the day began to increase. The text reads � I had been hitting my water bootle regulary. �@CAPS2 to the heat of the day, the cyclist was down to his water consuming large patterns of it at a time. He 	1	1		1																					
846	3	Joe Kurmaskie�s �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who don�t tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. @PERSON2, �The sun was beginning to beat down� I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer.	3	1		3																					
862	3	The features of the setting include �There are no one in sights, not a building, car, or structure of any kind which describes the trail the cyclist was taking. These features of the setting describe how the cyclist is affected because it elaborates on his doubting whetther he will survive or not.	1	1		1																					
863	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. The speed limit sign makes him feel like life is cruel. His first glimpse of the welch's Juice factory makes him feel excited. Meeting the deserted fork in the road makes him feel troubled. When he finally gets there, he feels relieved. These are all examples showing that features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
864	3	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist & his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,�and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place. Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert. that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced.	1	1		1																					
865	3	The features setting in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn�t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and how much he could ride.	1	1		1																					
866	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. In the story, it taliks about how the man is pedling twenty miles here and fourty miles there and it's very hot outside and he only has so much water abd he doesn't think he'll make it to where he was to go because its do not that he need more water. As the narrator sas"" I was travelling throuhg the high deserts of california in June"" which is extremely not in california in June. The deserts hot weather made him eimited on water supply, and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere, no buildings around makes him lose all hope for making it through. There were snakes in the desert which endagered him, and the bumpy road made it harder for him to hold on and get to somewhere. "" I began breaking the ride into distance i could see on te horizon, telling mself if i could make it treat i'd be fine."" This quote shows his struggle because of the area he was in but also his persitance. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this essay."	3	2		3																					
872	3	The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one. He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long  in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the author�s terrain. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I don�t have to bike in that terrain.  	2	1		2																					
879	3	During the authors ride to Yosemite, he doesn�t have the proper tools to go along the long stretch of desert he was to face, and by tools I mean water. The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. He described this with sentences like �Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.� The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water. The author was getting neat stroke being passed by @LOCATION2  desert snakes and tumbleweeds. The author was clearly in a struggle against the @LOCATION2 desert heat.	2	3		3																					
882	3	In the story it explained the beauty of the night, also about the outdoors and how it is effecting his trip. The features of the setting effects the cyclist, because the setting was mild, sounded warm and calm. Also it showed how it contains to us. The setting was similar to the cyclist. That�s how the features of the setting effects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
883	3	The cyclist was in California in June, the sun was beating down on him this made the ride difficult with short water supply The man came upon several towns that were abandond which made his water supply less. The terrain was long and straight then turned into tall hills which had to be difficult to ride.	1	2		2																					
886	3	The cyclist had a couple of affects in his journy. One of them was he hills the it was a problem because it used most of his energy and slowed him down. The other one was water, the lack of water. If the had enerf water he would have gotten a boost that would have kept him going.	2	1		2																					
892	3	The terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big affect on them. The first example of this is in they are riding on hills, it makes it much harder for them. For example when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to ride on hills he was, olcasly disappointed. Another thing that affects cyclist is the smothness of the road they are riding on. In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the main character came to rough spot in the road and was disappointed and didn�t want to ride it. Another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat. Several times in the story, the cyclists says that he is tired and dehydrated, at one point he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke. Those are the effects of the rider�s setting have on him/her.	2	2		2																					
895	3	The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water. He did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him. Being in that situation and setting I would have given up.	2	2		2																					
903	3	The @CAPS1 is affected in many ways. The major thing that effects him is the lack of water. Throughout the story he mentions the lack of water. He also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route. For example, �I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off thire porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� The @CAPS1 says things about the older gentle man throughout the story.	2	2		2																					
909	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,� That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.� This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
911	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist mood and behavior. First the cyclist sees from believing the shortcut will help him arrive to Yosemite faster then he relies it wont. Next, the harsh sun and rafh terrain and lack of water causes the cyclist to give up hope that he will make it to yosemite and causes him to rethink his judgement and taking advice from others.	1	2		2																					
921	3	The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says �and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June�. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says �I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul�. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.	2	2		2																					
926	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. It does because the road is not in good condition and he has to travel a long distance with the bad weather. This affects him because he might get dehydrated. In conclusion there are many things in the setting that affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
928	3	The setting was the main affect on the cyclist. He said it was hot and that he was lost. The cyclist had no clue were he was going and it was hot out side. He seemed very strest and that only made it worse for him. He was thirsty from all riding and the heat so he trys to get water from a water pump. The water that was in it was horable. He called it a �substance� it had a flavor of battery acid. �If he were not lost and if it were cool outside he would have water and he would not be so upset. The setting of a hot and lost place had a huge impact on the cyclist.     	2	2		2																					
931	3	The setting of this story affects the cyclist alot. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run-down out of dated town which didnt help him when he was lost. The town is out of date and hot. Which bring another problem, the cyclist was dehydrating because he didnt have enough water. He would hilusinate and see things that werent there. He become very tired in the hot sun. So the setttling in this short stories effected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																					
936	3	The features  of the setting affect the cyclist in that it made him use up his water supply and tested his determination. � Sometimes life can be so cruel� implies that he was having a horrible time coping with the setting he was in. To himself he thought be was gonna die at any moment.	1	1		1																					
937	3	In the essay �Rough road ahead: do not exeed posted speed limit,� the author is continually depressed, by the features of the landscape he passes. At first he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water, this sight doesn�t bothe him. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a �rusted water pump,� and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path then he passes an abandoned Welch�s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. The setting its features serve to dissappoint depress the cyclist in his quest to find water.	3	2		3																					
939	3	At First the narrator in Do not Exceed  Posted Speed limit was energetic enthusiastic  about their journey to Yosemite national Park .After getting some helpful advice about a few short cuts the cyclist sets out for adventure .First thing they encounter is ghost town .The gentlemen they a taken advice from had assured them it was booming prosperous town .This set the first wave of doubt through the cyclist mind .Then lack of water began .They were travelling through the high desserts of California in June and slowly running out of water .Flat road was soon replaced by short , rolling hills which only increased the cyclist state deliriousness .After a few more dissapointments the cyclist decides there is no hope and they are going to die .The reader is partly drawn in believing that this is the end for the cyclist .All of the disappointments set the stage for the end of the cyclist and you can�t stop reading because you have to find out what happens.If it weren�t for the hopelessness of the setting you wouldn�t care.	3	2		3																					
947	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. For example, the story said,""I gathered up a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth"" This quote explains that the setting was very and had pebbles. The setting benefiting him by taking the thrist off his mind. If their wasn't any pebbles by the cyclist he @MONTH1 not have made it. In cocnlusion in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the cyclist was benefited by the features of the setting."	1	1		1																					
951	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in �Do not exceed posted speed limit� had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist�s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. �It didn�t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.	2	3		3																					
952	3	"In the short story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays an extremely important role. The story takes place in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling around 12 mph. the heat made his dehydration situation much worse.  �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� The cyclist was losing hope, yet he was still determined to find water. This setting was very important to the story, for if it had taken place at @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, it would not have made sence. The setting contributes to the story by raising the intensity of the situation."	2	2		2																					
959	3	All the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strerigth. It seems like he might have collapsed it he hadn't thought he was going to @CAPS1, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him.	2	2		2																					
961	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didn�t bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer way. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling. Moreover, it was a June day and in June the days are hot with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated. This is how the setting affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
963	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
965	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening. His water supply got drank quickly and he couldn�t find a town near. He was in the desert-like California, and the sun was beating down on him. When he did one town, it was more of a �ghost town�, and had rusted pumps that had battery-oil tasting liquid. Every person he asked told him is near, but from dehydration, it took him longer. the roads got windy and small hills occurred. There was a large snack in the middle of the road, as the tumble weed blew by. the finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down.   	2	2		2																					
966	3	"The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit definitely affected the author. The cyclist states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate  through the ""hills"" as opposed to the ""Flat roads,"" making him more quickly tired. The speaker states, �I could drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a �heatstroke� which could slow him down. The speaker also states,""water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees""(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated. Many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist.  "	3	2		3																					
967	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if the old men didnt give the boy advice then he probably wouldnt have run into all the trouble he ran into. At the same time the boy made his way to were he was going. Next time though he will just use his map so he dont have to go through the scare of death again.	1	1		1																					
968	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by the road�s condition being rough as the cyclist rides further along the road.	1	1		1																					
973	3	The setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� really goes against the cycilist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page @NUM1 it says, �a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn�t cool down,� This explains how bad the water was when the cycilist was there.	1	1		1																					
975	3	The feature of the setting included nice cool pines and than a gost town and it bein hot out and banser of @CAPS1 and posine snacks and hills that where getting harder to go up. When he first started the pines where nice and cool but when he scan the gost town he sot dischriced than it started to set hot and than he seen the snack and thout that it was a dimed baby and was nuvves and than he was carid of dehydration than the hills started to make it harder and harder that is what it was like.	2	2		2																					
978	3	In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it�s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It�s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn�t take the old mans advice.	3	2		3																					
981	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more.� I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldn�t find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit�, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
982	3	He feels alone there is noune around him to push him, and yet he keeps going trying to push him self to the end to win. The fast roads are rough and the hills are tall but he is a determined to finish.	1	1		1																					
985	3	The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time. Destined to reach yosemite national park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening strongly. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture. next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted�. With what I believed to be my last burst of enery, I manevuered down the hill�. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replerilshed with confidence he had before when he �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile�	3	2		3																					
992	3	Almost all the features of the settin affect the cyclist. For instence the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is. �The water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips. Wid rings of sweet circled my shirt.� These description suggests that he is very hot since he is sweety and hes been drinking so much. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town. �I began breaking the ride down into distress I could make it test for.� He is making the ride seem like a lot of short rides so he could make it.	2	2		2																					
993	3	The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others. As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat. In one sentence the effect of the heat were clearly described by the cyclist	1	1		1																					
994	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first �town�, and described it as only having �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall� I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldn�t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp � If you want bait for the big ones, we�ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
998	3	The futures of the setting affect the cyclist was that he show the maD to other people and he shouldn�t (ister) to others where he had it to go.	1	1		1																					
1002	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch�s Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water $ be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of liFe or building. Therefore his surrouding throughout the story make him indifferent, confident & relieved.   	3	2		3																					
1003	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough, uneven and he has to push out more energy to pedal his bike on rough, uneven roads then on nice, paved, even roads and also he is out of water so there again is using all his energy without any redaveanator.	1	1		1																					
1018	3	The cyclist was riding his bike and was trying to get to rosemite and he had lack of water but he went on any way and he had to go past a snake and got scared.	1	1		1																					
1023	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include:- the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first �town� he found he described as a �ghost town� It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly and [he] was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road [being] replaced by short, rolling hills wasn�t helping either. The terrain really affected the ?? he had to exert in order to keep going, along with being dehydrated the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals. During his journey �a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority of the ?? �which  ?? him it could have ?? The features of the getting definitely affected the cyclist in many ways	3	2		3																					
1025	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly be coming dehydrated. Another feature is that all the building seem to be either abandoned or in despair.	1	1		1																					
1029	3	Because he is dehydrated, the setting makes him worse. He�s biking, in California, in @LOCATION2. It�s not and the sun is probably scorching. The heat plus all the biking he�s doing, is making him even more thirsty and tired.	1	1		1																					
1030	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. The cyclist had been riding on the �high deserts of California in June.� The cyclist also saw a �ridiculously large snake.� There was also no signs of civilization for miles.� There was no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The cyclist went through many different obsticales travilng, triying to get to Yosemite. I think the settingS affected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																					
1036	3	"The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because it�s a dry area in California in June. The cyclist really needs water which is the main thing affecting him besides the fact that he�s lost in a ghost town. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed."	1	1		1																					
1037	3	"The feature of the cyclist was very good �it erodding to who he say in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1�. I would describe it as a fun. It also looks this time was one of his bes time. Here are some examples he is happy, competive, and thin is full. I�m going to explain my examples. First, he looks hoppy becaus in the story he said �the morning with strong legs and smile on my face. the phase can to you how hoppy he felt. My second example was competive, he seems like a competive person, bcouse he is very heathy and lead to to take a ride from the bike. My third example is the way he is becasse he soid ""As easily as sounding  bond, my trouble, thirst and fears were all behind me the part made me feel.  "	1	2		2																					
1038	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes �that road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road. The speed limit is also affect the cyclist. When the the speed limit sign is appear, the character feels �life can feel so cruel� (kurmaskie @NUM1). It tells us that character can not do what he is trying to do. The bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1040	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, �The sun was beginning to beat down�, the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�, California�s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exguasted and dehydrated. 	2	3		3																					
1049	3	At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey, is just beginning. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles �battery acid.� The terrain begins to feel like more of a hill, which makes the struggle even worse. The cyclist is drinking water more now, and is becoming tired. He comesto a rough road and says, �sometimes life can feel so cruel,� which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative affects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride, a snake blocks his path and he becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of water in the restroom. The water is a feature @NUM1 the setting that refreshes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unknown area are features that make the cyclist feel lost and tired.	2	2		2																					
1053	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the @LOCATION1, where it�s nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. He�s excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch�s Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again.	2	3		3																					
1055	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First the climate affected him the most thats so because he became to hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated. So he had no energy because of dehydration. Another one is the built of the road. That�s so because it was rocky bumpy, winding, hills with being dehydrated the road was very tempting to just give up and die. Then the heat got him because there was no shade, no water left, and the sun just beating down on him.	2	2		2																					
1057	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the bad condition roads. The was also hills so they made it harder for the cyclists.	1	1		1																					
1058	3	�There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. This adaodoness makes it hard for the cycleist to frot hope and threes as where to get water. �I could drop from a heat strote in a gorgeous day in June, hes in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around no one this make's him very desperate since hes adaodoned.	1	2		2																					
1059	3	The main features that affected the cyclist were the ruff terrain and the hot sun. The rough terrain made it harder to pedal and it tired the cyclist out faster. But also helping was the hot sun because it would dehydrate him while he was riding. So between the hard to pedal rough terrain and the dehydratiog hot sun, the cyclist was very affect to the point of exausition.	1	1		1																					
1060	3	The features of the setting in the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit� affect the cyclist. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as �a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.� The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, �The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large� snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn�t give up and is relieved when he finally receives water.	3	3		3																					
1063	3	The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many way. It was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty. For example, �The sun was beginning to heat down� (pg @NUM1). So the sun is very exhusting and made him to start dehydrating. Another example is a traveling through the desert of California in June� (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state and June is one of it�s warmer months. The terrain didn�t favor in the riders either �Flat road had turned into, short rolling hills �(pg @NUM2). Short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain. This is how the setting affected the rider.	2	2		2																					
1071	3	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they�re water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest.	1	1		1																					
1074	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn�t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn�t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn�t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn�t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn�t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don�t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better.	3	2		3																					
1075	3	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that he is going up this big hill its hot, there snakes, hes scared and tired. Almost all of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop he is determined to go up this hill. He also knows that it cant be that bad because he can just relax al the way back down.	1	1		1																					
1076	3	"After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,�water-deplating� one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as �rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrator�s hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally."	2	3		3																					
1078	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways.for example, he ask the older guts, ""that haven't left rheir porches since carter was in the office where the next placewas to get water. Also he was out in the middle of nowhere. It was also in June were the weather was warm,and he didn't have a lot of water."	1	1		1																					
1082	3	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him.	1	1		1																					
1089	3	The features in the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affect the biker. For example, the heat is constantly drying the biker out. Also, at the first town the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause with water tastd like �battery acid�. Even after that were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit. The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along ride. The pebbles that he found helps him out. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip. In conclusion, the setting makes the riders journey an  one, but in the end the bait store had just what he needed.	2	2		2																					
1090	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.	1	1		1																					
1093	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, �by Joe Kurmaskie had many obsticales to over come. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, �@CAPS1 my gosh, what did I get myself into?!� Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in.	2	2		2																					
1097	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he is faced with roadways he is unsure of the weather is hot and dry and there are wild animals. The text states,	2	2		2																					
1099	3	"In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasnt traveling in a car, he was riding a bike and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike. ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel.� In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he�s at risk of running out. Not only that but he�s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.� I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.� So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings. "	3	2		3																					
1100	3	"The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people. When he got into the first town he had ran out of water to drink but the towns water he was in now tasted like battery acid so that�s not safe to drink. As he started to head out the scenery changed. �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore."	2	2		2																					
1103	3	The setting affects the cyclist by showing that he is a little angry. He states that �don�t remember the saying don�t take candy from strangers.� So we know he is upset about something. He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and it�s wrong. The man figure that out halfway through the story. He also said that �the old man hasn�t been off his porch since Carter was in office,� so he needs to get his directions up to date. So the beginning is a negative attitude.	1	1		1																					
1105	3	While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listen to some old  men who gave him directions for a shortcut.When he began his trip everything was fine.But then he found that along the �shortcut� there was no building.By the time he figured out that the old men were mistake he had almost run out of water.There was nothing around that he could drink.He was getting very thirsty.The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn�t make his task any easier.About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills, which made his trip even harder.Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his strength to get to it just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory.This made going without water much harder as well as he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice.In the end he finally make it to a pait shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could	3	3		3																					
1106	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For example when he was riding on the road he would pick a destination and ride to it. Then he would take a break. If this destination was a building he would be strong willed and determined. If it looked like their was nothing ahead but hills, he would just ride and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world.	1	1		1																					
1110	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because on page @NUM1 it talk about how the cyclist had to go down a hill then find a factory for juice. Like if the cyclist don�t find any building he would of kept the hill and wasted the little bit of energy for actaire.	1	1		1																					
1114	3	The biker has many features in his story. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example �One long, crippling hill� I can picture it in my head. �There was no one in sight.� All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help.	1	1		1																					
1118	3	I think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going. He can reach the place without water but that is not a good thing to do.	2	2		2																					
1119	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist�s mood throughout the essay. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet help helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, �Things began well enough� flat roads�� This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a �smile on the face.� (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, ��I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next �town�. Finally, when the author reaches �Gary & Wilber�s fish camp� he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, �know The best way to get There? �Yes sir! I own a very good map.� This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude.	2	2		2																					
1120	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is in the desert it is in the summer. It affect the cyclist because he is riding a bike. For exsempl in the story he is running out of water. He is starting to git dehyjradid.	1	1		1																					
1122	3	After sometime into his trip he mentioned �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I believe that this setting had gotten him determined to keep on pedaling so he could live. But then he started to think he might die, but he wasnt sad or upset, he was happy. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the fact that he might die because he listend to some old men. In my opinion I think he was having the time of his life peddeling through this setting of California.	1	1		1																					
1123	3	Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesn�t have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would�ve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, don�t use a bike in the desert, its not to smart.	1	2		2																					
1135	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. In the story it says, ""I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" This is telling the reader that the weather was hot and you need a lot of water here to survive, especially if you are riding a bike or working. Later on in the story it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This quote gives the reader information and tells us that the cyclist is having a hard time surviving through the harsh features of the setting through the harsh features of the setting. In California deserts I know from prior knowledge it is hot and dry, exspecially in the summer. If you are working outside, like the cyclist in this story is, and you do not have water to drink, you will get dehydrated which eventually leads to death. The author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
1136	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One thing is the water. There is little water and it is boiling hot. He took some taste of it. He said �It tasted like battery acide.� To me if the water is hot don�t taste it. Another thing is the land. The land went from straight to hilly. That started slowing him down. Last, is the day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking. He wanted to get as far as he could.	3	2		3																					
1137	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist when he got tired very easily because he was biking in the desert in June. There are no rivers in the that desert so he couldn�t get water. It is so hot out there that he couldn�t see very well because of all the sweat that went into his eyes. Also there are no people out there because of how hot it is.	1	1		1																					
1139	3	A cyclist always has to face many problems such as the weather, the condition of the road, etc.	1	1		1																					
1142	3	"The setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" is very important to the events that occured in the  story. For example the story was set on a  highway set at @NUM1 which the cyclist was only able to do @NUM2. This is signifigant to the events of the story because since he was doing @NUM2, which by the away is a lot for a cyclist and it led to almost dehydration. Plus it was hilly. This led to the excution of the cyclist, so one could see that setting is very important to the outcome of the story."	2	2		2																					
1143	3	The setting is in a California which isn�t really the coolest of places to be.[temperature]	1	1		1																					
1147	3	The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists� brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists� travel much harder.	2	1		2																					
1156	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is, the setting. The cyclist is out in the dessert, in two-hundred degree weather. With very little water. Also, the cyclist didn`t have a map and he asked someone that hasn`t let their porch since carter was in office. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn`t been off their porch in decades.'' This quote talks about how the setting (@NUM1 degree weather, dessert) can @CAPS1 him. Also, he listened to someone that didn`t know what they were talking about. In conclusion that is how the features of setting affected the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
1158	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the condition of his surrounding it was hot so he got dehydrated more and needed more water. There were a lot of hills so he had to pedal harder and use more energy to get up the hills. There were no cars, building, smog, just nature. It was peaceful and relaxful ride on the bike thats the setting affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1164	3	The setting affects the cyclist mood in the story the cyclist takes a short cut with many abandon towns, and buildings as well as a bumpy, terrain. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump he immediately began to pump it the water was not good for drinking. He was determined to make it to the next town. �I could make that� he said. Because of the ghost town and the old pump he had to continue on. When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road a hed he began to get depressed, �I was sad�. Finally when he reached @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 Fish Camp he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain. At the end when the setting is bright so is his mood.	2	3		3																					
1166	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasnt pre pared in the beginning, the cyclist got directions from an old man who hadnt left his porch in years so he wouldnt know what had changed. Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town �I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� This quote means that he wasn�t expecting hills, he thought it was going o be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features.	2	1		2																					
1169	3	In the short story, �Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, expresses the features of the setting like the lack of water, and can not find help to the end affects the cyclist in the story. During his time of need the cyclist says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom.� The cyclist has a lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall down; giving up on hope. When the cyclist finds hope, �And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.� The cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive. The cyclist should not have taken the old peoples advice for granted, but will now look onto people�s sense of directions.	3	3		3																					
1173	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldn�t get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake.� They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted �I eased past.� When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist�s journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other �GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, we�re your BEST BET.""The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect. These are features that had an affect on the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1175	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who haden�t gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldn�t get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip.	2	3		3																					
1176	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, he cannot get water and becomes dehydrated, then, he goes on a rough ride and loses more energy. Then he finds the bait and gets water. All of these greatly affect the cyclists condition.	1	1		1																					
1177	3	The setting of the cyclist�s journey effected him because if he was a tot desert in california. This effected him because he had to ride a bike throug it and he heat took a lot out of him. He didn�t have a lot of water because there were no rivers or water supply because of the desert surrounding him. At the end he finds a store which affects him because he gets a cool drink and same supplies which helped him. So in the end his surroundings destroyed him and then relieved him.	2	2		2																					
1181	3	 The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they doubt or lessen his chances for survival, but the cyclist is determined so he survives.	3	2		3																					
1183	3	No water, rough terran, bad info-all are reasons why the boy isn�t doing so well I said no water because he is dehidrated but needs to soae his water. Also he could die from heat exauston. I also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help. And to top it off he took info from old people that didn�t know what they were talking about. Theas leave all examples about the essay that support my writing.	2	2		2																					
1196	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, the setting affects the way that the cyclist rides. In this story, the setting is out in nowhere wit no water, and all he can see is roads. This affects the cyclist because he is hungry, thirsty,and now he's about to go down a really steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously insuring himself with noone around to get help from the setting of nowhere affects the cyclist in this story.	1	1		1																					
1197	3	The features in the story tell me that it was in a very dry, not populated area. It says that there were rolling hills, in a desert of California, and that it was dry. I think those things affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. Going up and down hills can be very tiring, especially when you don�t have a lot of water left, and need to save some. The quote �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,� tells me a lot about the story. In a desert in California in June during the summer is a very brave and stupid thing to do. It s twice as hot during the summer.	3	0		2																					
1202	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The text first mentions that, �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.� This shows that the cyclist felt in saccure and was starting to upset him. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist is, �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� You can see through the cyclists that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps were lame. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, �battery acid,� that he wouldn�t last much longer. In- conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. 	1	1		1																					
1209	3	The fatures of the setting affects the cyclist because in the story the character makes it seem like horrible weather for example when he said �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt� this is one way the setting affects the cyclist because it almost like your in the story and you can imagton what the character Is going through because everything is written in details.	1	1		1																					
1210	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it makes it hard for him to get to �@CAPS1 National Park�. He took advice from some old men to take a shortcut to get him where he wanted to be. On his ride there, he stopped at a �town�, which was, to him, considered a ghost town. Then he got to a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, but it was abandoned years earlier and he was becoming weak and dehydrated. He thought he would drop from a heatstroke. At the end of his ride, he reached a fish camp where he found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, �Know the best way to get there?� The man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist told the man �yes, sir: I own a very good map�. The man realized throughout the setting on his journey, that he would never accept advice from old-timers again.	1	1		1																					
1220	3	The features of the setting around the cyclist affected him to the point of exauhstion and dehydration. The cycllist being exauhsted and dehydrated,or tired and thirsty, was beging to wear as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs. The cyclist exlained the change by saying, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist�s idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hill of this californian desert rollar coaster. His water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud.	2	2		2																					
1226	3	Features of the cyclist affected the cyclist in many ways. One was the heat. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 that California is called, �the sunshine state�, I can infer that it was very hot. Another feature that affected the cyclist was when he thought he could get some water but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. This is said in. This is said in paragraph @NUM2. This is how features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1227	3	The setting features affected the cyclist because it was a conflict. It was a conflict because it was hot and he was lost. I was a confict that he was hot because he had a limited amount of water. Which he could get anymoe of because he was lost. The heat causes people to get thirsty but he couldn't because he was limited in water.Another conflict was that he was lost. This was a conflict that because he needed to be some where.	1	1		1																					
1229	3	There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the �short cut� that the old men give him he is confidenc. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, �I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. As the cyclist past another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water he found one lost drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive.	3	2		3																					
1230	3	The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time.	2	2		2																					
1231	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn�t have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn�t bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldn�t see anything in sight.	3	3		3																					
1234	3	Well in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limits by @PERSON1 the setting affects you because if you cant see any thing for miles and you are running out of water it has a sycological effect on you. You can start to panick like he did when it stoped in the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. Also you don know exactly where you are so that also affects u because you don�t know where to go or if you should turn back or what. If I was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me. 	2	2		2																					
1245	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist b/c the route, that the cyclist was taking there was a rough road him to travel. The cyclist took bad advice from some old men that hadn�t left off their porches for decades.  also, as he got into his long journey he began to notice what the advice the old men had given him was bad was bad advice, the cyclist was headed to Yosemite & he had gotten some advice from ???(not legible onwards)	1	1		1																					
1247	3	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected and one of these are the setting. The setting affects them because if it is short smooth setting the ride will be easy. But if it is long bumpy rough roads it will be harder to control the bike which means that the cyclist�s job will be harden this is how a cyclist is affected by his or her settings.	1	1		1																					
1251	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct.� This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,� by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.� This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, �To @CAPS2 a fire� where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. "	3	3		3																					
1256	3	Features of the setling affected the cyclist were the harsh & hot climate and terrain. The author clearly wrote how �the sun was beating down on him and how he almost died from dehydration.	1	1		1																					
1258	3	The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot and going up those hills had to be hard. The road was also very rough. It says, �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� It also says, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1264	3	"In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The setting around the cyclist led her to drink a lot of water because of the dry conditions. �I was traveling the hish deserts of California in June� This shows that most likely she was hot, sweaty, and a source of water was not near to her. The rough terrain also led to her using own strength to get up and down hills, and to get plants and animals. The settings in the story led the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak, she was forced on as low supply of water and dodge numerous hazards, with no sign of living people near her. �This place might have been a thrivins little spot at one time say, before the last world was"" This suggests a ghost town, where no people were currently living. There was nobody around her to help. The setting led to her deteriorating health. Her physical health was in danger because of her dehydration and her lack of energy. Her mind was also starting to ware. She had a shake her head to make sure what she was seeing in one part of the story.   "	3	2		3																					
1265	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didn�t have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� the speed limit was @NUM1. One more thing is make sure you don�t listen to a gentleman that is old and hadn�t be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1275	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist is confronted with a troubling setting on his journy to Yosemite. He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This setting is a major setback to the cyclist�s journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best outof it. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perserverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey.	3	3		3																					
1286	3	Well some features might have more than others and the cyclist might have more than others. Also the author faced alot of problems like the lack of water, the poisonous snakes and the condition of the road. So there were many thing that affected the author and the cyclist, when they were on there journey.	2	2		2																					
1288	3	There is many things that could have made his bycicle ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasn�t in the middle of no where and if he actually knew where he was. For example, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� There, he had almost no water to get him through the day. For instance, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him. In conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard.	2	2		2																					
1295	3	In the essay �Rough Road ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had many changes due to the setting of what was around. The cyclist was lost in the dessert. This affected him a lot because the desert is very hot. He could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion. Also, in the desert some animals can be very dangerous on the cyclist journey, he saw a poisonous snake. It was a good thing that he was cautious around the snake because if he wouldn�t have been, he might have gotten bitten and there would be no one around to help him. The desert that he was in. also happened to be desserted and there was no one around to help him with the directions. The worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water. Without the water, he could become very weak and dehydrated.  and could have even died. The setting of where the cyclist was affected him greatly.	2	2		2																					
1302	3	Throughout the riders long journey the setting greatly affected him. For example, the hot weather caused him to drink the majority of water suply making him dehydrated and tired. If the weather was cool he would have lasted much longer.	1	1		1																					
1304	3	Riding through beastly mountains, hot and burning deserts and no water. A cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions. The two old men gave him the wrong directions and send him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through. First he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion. Maps are made for people to use so if you have a map you should trust it and in the ending it shows that the cyclist learned that because he said �And I promised myself right then that I�d always stick to it in the future.�	3	3		3																					
1305	3	In the short story � Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed pusted speed limit.� A lot of things affeced cyclist. Such as the rocky road , and the lack of water for example where the author says �when I tried a drop or two, It had the flavor of battery acid.� this shows how has loosing lope, and he seems a little scared. Also the abandond towns  didn�t help.	1	1		1																					
1308	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. At first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had �a smile on.� (@NUM1). Then came large rolling hills which created a challenge, the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue. The rough terrain was next causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle. As if the rough terrain wasn�t energy soaking enough, a snake blocked a majority of pavement and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain, the harder for the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1309	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because depending on how the setting is, is how much skill they need. Like if their going down hill then they really only need to know how to control the bike. If their going up a mountain with lots of bumps they need to have some skill. Usually if their riding in a shady area then the wear clothes to keep them cool. But if their going to be in the sun the they need to wear light clothes. The setting affects the rider very much.	1	1		1																					
1310	3	"The setting in �Do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake �a ridiculously large"" snake � it realy didn�t look like a diamondback � blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me �(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways."	2	2		2																					
1315	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit while riding his bike the author Joe Kurmaskie has alongride. Where he is riding there is up and down hills also the road is very rough. He was running out of water in the desert. �I stopped at a rusted water pump to get water and a tar like substance oozed out.� @CAPS1 that he is off his bike he least worrie about the posionous snakes of the desert. He founded Welch�s grape juice factory but it was abandoned. The author found a bait shop and got water	2	2		2																					
1325	3	In this story the setting has a affect to the cyclist trip and to him self. It being hot and over @NUM1 degrees and going down hill with a lot of turns. The cyclist is getting so hot that hes water is no longer cold. Being in this desert is killing and about to make him have a heartstoke. All the things in the desert is doing a lot affect to the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1332	3	The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In �Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says �Over one long, crppling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1334	3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers �shortcut� as he states that �things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� But what he didn�t know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first �town� which was a ghost town. He wasn�t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how �a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting.	3	3		3																					
1341	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way that the features affect the cyclist, is that it is summer time, and it harder for the cyclist because	1	1		1																					
1346	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the conditions of the road and weather. he hit some bad and nasty water. along with other hazardous things, he also tried to ride through a desert where he had already drank all his bottles of water and had nothing left to drink, he was very dehydrated and had to drink nesles water. It was hard for him to keep going, being dehydrated so bad but he had to. at one point a big snake almost took up the entire road and he had to just ease his way on by it, his riding conditions were so bad, he thought he was going to die, he said the birds were going to eat him. The weather was so hot it was hard to go on, he finally found a bathroom, went inside it drank water from the sink and yellced to a man that told him the direction he wanted	2	2		2																					
1351	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was very hot. �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heartsroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		3																					
1353	3	The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the rode. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future. So he�s keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future.	1	1		1																					
1356	3	The terrain the cyclist faces don�t help very mach considering he is almost out of water, he came across hills that ticed himout a lot & made him even more thirsty. Also, when we came across the juice factory he used a lot of energy to get there because he was excited and that made him even more thirsty. Therefore if he didn�t have any energy left after all of that he wouldn�t have been able to get to the baits shop.	2	2		2																					
1358	3	The features in the setting in the story afects the cyclist in many ways. For example in the story it said, �At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.� This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest.	2	2		2																					
1359	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered.	2	2		2																					
1365	3	In the story the cyclist faces many issues that could stop him from not finishing his journey. First, his water supply could cause him to become dehydrated and he could pass out. Another issue is the hot weather in June, which could cause him to a heat stroke and literally die. The rough terrain could stop him from finishing the trip because he could pop a bike tire and would have to walk. The cyclist faces many problems that could end his trip and maybe even life, but pushs through and survives.	1	1		1																					
1368	3	The setting is a desert in California in June, this affects the cyclist because it is very hot and he only has a couple drinks of water. There is no place for the cyclist stop and get more water. He says, �there is no one in sight, not a building,car, or structure of any kind.� As you can see that kind of setting would definetly affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1371	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat bumpy which caused the cyclist to have an easy trip. In the story it said, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty when he finally say an old town ahead, he stopped and it looked like it was a bandoned he began to pump water out of the water pump and no matter how long it pumped for it looked like battery acid. The quote  from the story said, ""when I tried a drop or two, it hard the flavor of battery acid,� that is some features of the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his journey."	2	2		2																					
1372	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly. The cyclist is cycling in a desert, �...I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 it was hot and the sun is beating down on the cyclist, �the sun was beginning to beatdown...� @CAPS1 it is remote and there is no one to offer help or assistance, �...it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.� There are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles of water. He might have died from dehydration. �I got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tarlike substance oozed out.� There @CAPS1 was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bit the cyclist. @CAPS1, there were hills that required more energy to get up. Since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty.	2	2		2																					
1375	3	The setting in the reading affected the cyclist because it was hot, dry, and nothing around. Being hot was one part of the setting that affected him because he had to drink water a lot. It was dry every where around him so he couldn�t stop anywhere and cool off. Also when things got hard there was nothing around but ghost towns and abandoned buildings. This is how the setting affected him.	1	2		2																					
1378	3	I think that if we where to inforce the punishments on those who speed that there wuold be less car crashes really those that have bad road rage shuold be in anger management	0	0		0																					
1379	3	"There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feature included the first ghost town that he come by. �but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut haven�t peen out for awhile. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a ""desert in California in June."" The cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water. The hills also had an affect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water. The Welch�s building also had an affect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the National Park."	2	2		2																					
1380	3	The cyclist see his journey affect by a succesion of events that will make his journey trave?? every time more difficul and difficult. One of the first errors his makes is take advice from people that have no clue of where there are at. @CAPS1 (I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map.) The temperature of the desert also influenced him (I was travelling through high desert of California). The  cyclist also finds his' self with a combination of emotions at times he thinks he is going to past away and at times he believes he will be fine. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) As i stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drunk deeply from the sink, I thought i had a over whelming wigs to seek Gary.	2	3		3																					
1382	3	In the story, The man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. He faces many obsticales in the story. For example, he has gone about @NUM1 miles without water. Also, their are a lot of hills and turns withen the story which slow him down He is having a hard time getting to water because of many obsticals	1	1		1																					
1390	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The getting of the story is, �a reservoir campground outside of @CAPS1, California� during the early summer. Being the early summer in souther California, the temperatures are going to be hot. And the main character, who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity, is a going to sweat a lots. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water. The water runs out and we are now it our conflict. The setting also reads the main character to his resolution of the conflict. Being by a reserveir, fishing is going to be a popular activity. A bait and tackle shop would be the perfect business to have, since there who is at bait and tackle shop, the cyclist could go inside a quinch his thirst. Therefore, the setting of the story affect affects the conflict and the solution.	3	3		3																					
1394	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the different aspects of the setting effect the cyclist in several ways. When he first begins he doesn�t even notice how hot it is and he says, �the ran was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� His mood starts to change very quickly. Soon he drinks most of his water of becomes increasingly tired. He finds a water pump which irriates him when he realize the water tastes like �battery acid.� As he continues he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamond back so he slowly goes by out. When he notices a factory he uses his last bit of energy to reach it only to be discouraged when he finds it abandone. His spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water.	2	2		2																					
1398	3	The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion.	1	2		2																					
1403	3	Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story.	1	1		1																					
1408	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speeed limit,� the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story it says �The sun was beginning to beat down. �This quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This means that the cyclist is cold not only going to have to deal with the heat, but he is also going to have to side-over hill after hill. Eventhough they @MONTH1 be small, rolling hills, it still takes alot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is �I got down on my hands and knes, walking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out, followed  by brackish water feling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees �this quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water, that he uses his small amount of strength left to try and get some water. When he finally does get some water, it first come out as an ooey substance then the water come out really hot. In conclusion, these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting. 	2	3		3																					
1411	3	The features the cyclist experianced during his ride affect his body and mind. At first the cyclist was on flat graund, drinking plenty of water and without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became ton on water. This troubled him, but he was optomistic telling himself �the next town was only eighteen miles.� After this the road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� this started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge. Once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would �take your mind off of thirst.� When he finally made it, he was so relieved. Everything from dehydration, wich affects the body to lozing hope affected the cyclist on his ride	3	2		3																					
1414	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because he knows he�s in the wrong area. The cyclist understand's that he should have never took that advice from them old men. So he was upset and new he should have taken his advise. The cyclist had a feeling that he wasn�t supposed to take it that way he said he shouldn�t have let them take a peek at his map. So the features really affect him.	1	1		1																					
1426	3	The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. �The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. I�m sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing.� That road was replaced by a host rolling hills. �With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the author�s �Short, rolling hills�, the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain. I�m sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills.    	3	3		3																					
1434	3	The features of the settings affects the cyclist a lot in the passage called  �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. Cyclist are in very good physical shape. They can cycle for along time; however, weather can affect the cyclist. This happened in the passage. The cyclist was determined and confident he could make this journey. �I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Even though he had confidence the features of the setting affected the cyclist. �Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�.�. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips�. The cyclist was tired and exhausted. The weather and terrain had worn him down. The weather can change my level of ability sometimes. I love to play basketball outside. When it is hot and humid out I can�t play as long. The features of a setting can clearly affect people.	3	2		3																					
1436	3	The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble. Because of the lack of water, not only might be die but he begins to see mirages. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isn�t good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic can�t help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, they�re landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
1442	3	The cyclist listen to the geogers. after a while he starts to get tired. After the seenery desert change he starts to get mad. He criticizes himself for accepting advice from �old-timers who haven�t left the	2	2		2																					
1447	3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the tormils in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills the Welch factory, & finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a heven, @NUM1 safe ground that contains everything the men needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready & eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is wher the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as �the high deserts of California.� The sun is boiling down & water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder the chances of his survival lessons. When he crosses a snake, it suggest even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive & is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
1448	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is riding his bike along the road and encounters a dilema.�� @CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. Blocked the� pavement in front of me.� He had to stop and into by the snake which showed him down and freaked him out. He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that �really did look like a diamondback.� @CAPS2, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it�s a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles.� I�d read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.� * @CAPS3 he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on. This affected him because he @CAPS3 got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning. The features of 	3	2		3																					
1452	3	"In the story, these are many elements that affected the cyclist in his journey.The first features of the setting that affects him is the old water pump, which did not work, and when it did the water from it lasted horrible. The next obstacles on his journey was rough terrain. ""Flat road  was replaced by short rolling hills,"" was how he described it. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be  abandoned. Eventually he finds a  town and rest after his long journey, and learns his lesson from before not to take advice from people he doesn�t know."	2	2		2																					
1453	3	Well the features were rough desert like features. For a cyclist this terrain is difficult. For example the lack of water, and the battery acid flavor. These affected the cyclist in a major way.	1	1		1																					
1456	3	There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey. This cyclist seemed to have bad wick. He starts off mentioning that he is planning a trip to Yosemite and the men that hear this give him a tip. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions. He ends up getting lost. The cyclist is also travelling in the �high deserts of California in June.� That means that he is travelling in summer with dry air. When he gets to the first �town� he sees, he can it get the water he needs to rehydrate his body. He also runs into a snake while travelling through the desert, which slows him down. Because it�s hot, and he�s tired, he begins to see mirages that affect him. All of these features cause the cyclists to take one long, tiring journey through the desert. These features also taught him the lesson to not take advise from old men who have not left their porch because their information @MONTH1 be out of date.	2	2		2																					
1459	3	Hot, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink. He will get dehydrated. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structur of any kind. Finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road. So he had to move around it.	2	2		2																					
1462	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY IT BEING SO HOT OUTSIDE THAT HE COULD HAVE HAD PASSED OUT AND DIED. ALSO HE SAW A SNAKE THAT SCARED HIM TO DEATH BUT HE PASSED THE SNAKE. ALSO HE SAW A BUILDING THAT COULD PROBABLY HELP HIM BUT IT WAS ABANDONED,IT WAS A WELCH FACTORY THEN AS HE RUNS FURTHER DOWN HE SAW A FISH PLACE AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO GET SOME WATER then somebody asked him where he was going and they tined totzy him but he still had his map so he decided that he was going to use it instead of listening to other people.	2	3		3																					
1473	3	The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. �Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�. After reading this information and the descriptions. I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadn�t taken the �shortcut� that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author.	2	3		3																					
1474	3	"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welch�s Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, �with all my strength.� @CAPS1 he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because �it had the flavor of battery acid.� Next, the Welch�s Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of �a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice�, made him feel worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, all refreshments in the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am alergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2�s peanut shade. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and ""drank deeply from the sinle.� He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sush : bar, and sush: is my favorite food."	3	3		3																					
1476	3	In the setting they are in lodi, California. That is a part of the desert. The desert effects the cyclist real bad. For one it is really hot. Two the heat is making him thirsty and is running out of his water. Then last he is near no towns so he can�t get anymore water, so the setting does effect the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1477	3	The cyclist is most affected by e heat. He is exerting all his energy and will to get to Yosemite. The hot sun and lack of water makes him very tired and causes him to use his energy inefficiently. At one point, he has to make sure the building is a mirage. It is so hot his mind could be playing tricks on him.	1	1		1																					
1478	3	The conditions that the cyclist was in was very horid as he continued on his ride he got hotter and hotter hoping to find water after he finished of his last bit. Taking advices from an old man was and his last decision he made.	1	1		1																					
1479	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because sometimes, it made him lose some courage and optimism. �and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day� This is an example of how he lost courage. I wanted to be brave and be strong. But the hot day and all the sweat made the author feel weak. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear� This is an example of how the author lost some optimism. He didn�t want to die, but he kept telling himself that he was going to , he should have thought to himself that he was going it make it, but the setting was just to rough. There were bumps along his ride, and the sun beating down his thirst, he became less courageous and less optimistic.	2	2		2																					
1480	3	The features of his journey are cruel. �Rolling hills,� make him work harder to get over them. The more he works, the more he sweats and therefore he needs fluids to do so. The lack of water he has does not help. Poisonous don�t really bother him if he leaves alone. The condition of the roads adds on to the hills. Rough roads make him work hard to get through and then over the hills. So this guy is getting it pretty rough.	2	1		2																					
1481	3	Some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hills. It says in  the reading � flat road was replaced by short rolling hills� this would wear a person out without a good supply of water and is not sure in what direction he is travelling. And another thin g that affects him is the hot june weather in California.	2	1		2																					
1483	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. He becomes delusional when he said that  if he were lucky one of the stones would be lodged in his throat. Also he is dehydrated because he uses all of his water tend is having to push hard to make it to the next town.	2	2		2																					
1484	3	The features of the setting started out easy like a road thats flat cool lines to keep him cool and not hot. Then it sat harder lack of water road is not flat anymore snakes the cool pines are gone. 	1	1		1																					
1485	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "	3	2		3																					
1491	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	2	3		3																					
1492	3	"In the story the cyclist was affected. The cyclist was affected by the directions of the old man. It sas that they gave it to him to help him out. That it was a shortcut. I think the cyclsit thinks the directions are out of date. The reason think this is that in the second sentence of the story it says, ""never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the continues of their porches since carter was in office."" The feature of the setting also affected him because he had to ride upand down through what he though of as it, rough terrain. That is what I think affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1498	3	The story begins as the author, a cyclist, has taken directions from several very old men to reach his bike-ridden destination of Yosemite National park. He starts out confident enough and then reaches the first town the gentleman described. It is a ghost town and amuses the author still believing he�s perfectly fine he sets out again this time arriving at a place with �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule� It is at this point that the author starts to worry as his water supply is low. He preceeds past rolling hills, snakes, tumbleweeds and different land-marks. Each one rips his confidence and exciterent to shreds. Especially the juice factory as the author is currently very dehydrated and losing all hope. Finally, he arrives at the water he seeks in the form of �Gary wilber�s fish camp,� and refreshes himself and his dried-out hope. Each time the author passed a land-mark his confidence took a beating, and even though he was in dire physical health not having any hope for his sunny breezy vacation can drain a person even more from the inside out.	3	3		3																					
1499	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negitvly because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no stones too get a drink at, For example he says �There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind's. This explains how his setting affected him because he had no where to go or get a drink. That is my reason why the cyclist settings where negitve.	1	1		1																					
1502	3	At first the terrain was fine and he confident. But when he reached the first town it looked like one of those ghoust towns in the movies. The next town didnt come up when he was told it would. The terrain was that of a desert no water for miles. But he stayed determind. And he made it to some water though.	1	1		1																					
1506	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist when he was thirsty. �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could be seen.� This proves that the rider was thirsty because in the paragraph before this talks about him having a last burst of energy going down a hill. And he was also sweating a lot. And also wiping sweat from his eyes. 	1	1		1																					
1515	3	In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� a cyclist is going against heat lack of water and rough hills trying to maneuver around.	1	1		1																					
1520	3	"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, �Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view�. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. Also it says in the story �I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."	3	3		3																					
1522	3	"The features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist. When he started that ride, he was confident that the �old timers� were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he says� The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardy noticed.� He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, ""I got on my hands and knees When l tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid"" paragraph @NUM1. He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. Then he thought he has only @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept going. He weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. �With what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to, �gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth� just to keep his mind his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon � Gary and wilber�s fish camp best bet� then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map."	3	3		3																					
1527	3	"There were many features of the setting that affeced the cyclist. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 there is a sign that states rough road a head. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM4 it says ""over the long onpiling hill.� He also the tempature as started on page @NUM5 and at the top of page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM7 � l was travling in hing desertd of california in June. These conditions of the setting all effect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
1530	3	THE CYCLIST SETTINGS HINDER HIM IN THE ESSAY �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD. THE CYCLIST IS IN THE DESERT IN THE SUMMER TIME WITH HARDLY ANY WATER. HE IS TRYING TO FIND HIS WAY TO YOSEMITE, BUT HE GETS LOST ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE SOME OLD MEN GAVE HIM BAD DIRECTIONS. DURING THIS TIME HE IS RIDING HIS BICYCLE FOR MILES AND MILES IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER. HIS THOUGHTS OF THIRST GET IN THE WAY OF HIM TRYING TO CONTINUE ON TO FIND YOSEMITE. I BELIEVE THAT IF THE CYCLIST WAS IN A COOLER ENVIRONMENT THEN THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BECAUSE HIS SETTINGS WERE SORT OF A DISTRATION TO HIM	1	2		2																					
1531	3	The cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all. he was in the desert in june very hot day and every town he had come to was abandoned and had no water. It was also very hilly which made the work even harder. 	3	2		3																					
1538	3	With no one around and rough road ahead not to mention dehydration the cyclist begin to feel he was going to die. Because of this he began to dout himself but each time he saw something he tried to get there.	1	1		1																					
1541	3	"Features of the setting affect the cyclist�s moods in many ways. The story says. �About fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ""town.� ""The cyclist is probably allready tired from pedaling for fourty miles. Then he finds out that the town is desserted, which makes him a little frustrated. The next few stops are also desserted and he is almost out of water. He is becoming desperate. The road becomes bumpy and there is a large snake blocking the way. He is terrified. Finally, he reaches a bait shop with cool water ,and he is relieved. As you can see, the cyclist goes though many moods caused by the setting of the story."	2	2		2																					
1545	3	The dry, deserted area the cyclist is in, has many caations and	2	2		2																					
1554	3	In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and desserted. The description could suggest lonlieness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone and didn�t know where he was going, he still persisted. While he thought about �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� This thought kept him strong, so he kept trying.	1	1		1																					
1555	3	There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts. There was also a snake, which could have bit and kiiled him. As the road were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot,gross water	1	1		1																					
1556	3	When the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself. He sees everything as the old men told him. As he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty. �There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The man started becoming very unsure. You could tell he says �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get excited.� He was very doubtful he�d get to where he was going. In the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water.  	2	2		2																					
1566	3	The features in the setting, such as the ghost town desert, and the Juice factory, give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness. He is running out of water when he comes to the ghost town, which he thought was @CAPS1 because the next town was only a short ways down the road. However when he came to the next �town� and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot, foul liquid came up instead of water. He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welch�s factory, abandoned. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming �the birds will pick me clean,� To the cyclist also was best, then he was �saved� by a bait shop. These features in the setting gradually emptied his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his fait in old men, was returned.	2	3		3																					
1572	3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says� i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can�t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find �towns� nearby. Once he finds them, they are either �ghost towns� or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way.	3	2		3																					
1581	3	"In the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through �The high deserts of California in June.� It was hot, so hot the infact, that the author realized he could �drop from heatstroke� at anytime. This unbearable heat, coupled with the �crippling� hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a stale of severe dehydration. Obviously not exactig a positive effect. The swelting heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the eyeishes diverting water supply. However, �There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind� The cyclist was incomplete isolation for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, the sweating sun heating down upon him as he toiled up steep unyielding hills clearly the setting was affecting the cyclist in horribly negative way."	3	3		3																					
1587	3	"The features of the setting in �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� affected the cyclist. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The flat road that was easy to bike on had changed to many hills that made the cyclist's job alot harder. The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope."	2	2		2																					
1588	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected is when they have to cross the hills and plains. The hills make it very hard to pedal when going up hill. Another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water. They need water to survive especially during their long bike ride. Lastly, the heat the cyclist must endure also affects them. The heat makes it hard to stay focused on making the long journey.	2	2		2																					
1594	3	The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly men�s directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. He�s also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old men�s directions. He�s really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if they�ve lost it. 	2	2		2																					
1596	3	According to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example; the author states �I had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June�. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view�. This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclist�s trip and how it affected her.	3	3		3																					
1597	3	"In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. He followed the �short cut� that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer route. These old men had no clue what they were realy talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path through more obstacles. When the cyclist was in need of more water he ran into ""several rusty pumps."" No water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going @CAPS1 water. As he moved forwad in his travels he said that the �Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 any water, he did not have much strength left to face rolling hills, but he had no choice. The cyclist had to go on for miles @CAPS1 seeing anyone or anything. �There was noone in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" His troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp."	2	2		2																					
1600	3	The way the settings affect the cyclist is very crucel. First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left thier porch in decades. So once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist has a lack of water supply. Also the cyclist has incounters with snakes. Another the directions where way off so he had longer to go then he thought. Also when he arrived from his journey he found a deserted town. So in conclusion the cyclest uses his own directions from now on.	2	2		2																					
1601	3	"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist�s narrator�s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, �I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� Even at his first �ghost town� he just �chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on�. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, �One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men�. He said, �this was troubling�, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, �He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story."	3	2		3																					
1609	3	In the story, �Do not exceed postal speed limit,� many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. �Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who haven�t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.� This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. ��but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. �That smoky blues tune �Summer time� rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.� This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park.	3	3		3																					
1611	3	IIn the story I read the setting is a big factor to the affect of the cyclist for example it talks about how the cyclist see�s the sign that says, �Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit.� So the cyclist has to be cautious	1	1		1																					
1613	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding. For example he had no water so he was parched. There was a huge snake that took up half of the road and there wasn�t a building in sight. So the setting affected him with doubt but he had confidence of getting where he needed to get then when he got there it was a sign of relif. Thats how the setting affected was.	1	2		2																					
1619	3	The cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through. The cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns. Thats when he started to get thirsty. At first he wasn�t tired or thirsty because he was riding by cool trees and rushing water in the morning. Once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast. The lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad. The setting had everything, to do on how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke. That�s how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1635	3	This would be a hard risk to begin with, but the cycalist is taking it in the desert. As we all know, the desert can get boiling hot, so a bike ride could get enjoyable quickly. Also, when the only thing you see for miles is rode, sand and an empty factory, your moral can easily dray quickly. It�s just an overall way setting to give lost in.	1	1		1																					
1643	3	The features of the essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. When the author writes tumbleweeds crossed my path� it shows that he is most likely in the middle of nowhere. This is true because tumbleweeds are usually signs in movies and t.v. shows that the place is deserted. Also, when the author writes� the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke� and when he writes �a ridiculously large snake� show the growing danger that he is getting himself into. This is true because the snakes could get a tany time or he could just collapse from the lack of water and die. Lastly, the name of the store is revelant because it is a fish bait store and he is thirsty. This is revelant because fish live in water and he is thirsty and seeing the sign relieves him completely. Therefore, the features of this essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
1645	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limit� this many different settings took its toll on the cyclist. For example in the beginning he started out with a nice smooth ride. But it was very hot. Then he began to get into a hort rolling hills which were taking thier toll on his legs. Then we entered into a rough are where he had to be more careful. The roughness prolly wore him out from all the bumps and bounces. He went through a lot on that bike trip, who know he @MONTH1 have never made at back to where he was staying.	1	1		1																					
1646	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, �through the high deserts of California in June.� This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had no where to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder.	2	2		2																					
1647	3	One feature that effected the cyclist was the rolling hills. The  �text states � two miles into the section... I noticed  the terrain changing�	1	1		1																					
1652	3	In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, features of setting affect the cyclist because there is old people that been around for along time and you can�t ask for advice because they�re to old old to give information and wouldn�t know what their talking about. �A better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches sine Carter was in office.� That is the features of the setting and examples from the essay.	1	1		1																					
1657	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by him dehydrating and running out of time and energy. �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state� This quote proves the dehydration of the rider. �The glowing realization that I could die from a heat stroke,� this quote proves the time and energy of the rider is running out. These ideas and quotes show the features of the setting of the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1661	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist. He is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird. After that he starts to ride through the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more. When he arrives at the abandoned juice factory he is almost completely out of energy and almost can�t go on any further in his journey until he finally arrives at the bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him.	2	2		2																					
1662	3	The cyclist was begging to feel that death was coming his way as he continued withought a building in sight. This made him grow histerical over the situation, and still have enough energy to feel sorry for himself. Then when he finally did see a building he thought it was a mirage.	1	1		1																					
1664	3	The setting in the passage is working against the cycler. Hes running low on water hes almost dehydrated and the weather were hes at is very very hot and he cant see a town for miles.	1	1		1																					
1665	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because it was really hot out, he had very little amount of water, and a long way to go. The temperature was so hot, the cyclist said he felt dehydrated. He also had to go over a lot of hills and go through deserts to get where he needed to go. He took a �shortcut� but it ended up taking longer and he got dehydrated. This is how the setting affected him.	2	2		2																					
1668	3	The setting of the story had effected the cycle�s becuse if it was sub earbs he could have stoped any where and got water but the plot was in a middle of a desert and all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water For example, he had to go @NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water and if he was not in the desert with hills he could have made that in no time at all    	1	1		1																					
1680	3	The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, �and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke� the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, �I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.� This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally.	2	2		2																					
1692	3	When riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist. Some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad will make the cyclist second guest: riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and even more exhasted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and all he/she sees is a desert then they might have doubts on where there going. If there are abandon buildings everywhere the cyclist @MONTH1 become frighten and want to head back of lose hope as shown in the story �Do not exceed the speed limit� when he gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Many things can affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1693	3	"The features of the setting exhuberate the cyclist. The June weather added to the water depletion, being the beginning of summer, when the cyclist �arrived at the first �town�"" it was deserted, and the water had disgusting water. The author uses verbal irony when calling it a town �town� having it not really be a town anymore. The large snake presented an air of danger and another abandoned Grape Juice Factory added to the hopeless lost tone. "	2	2		2																					
1703	3	The cyclist is alone traveling on a flat land at first following the direction in which the old men told him to get to Yosemite National Park in @LOCATION1. During his travels he becomes dehydrated cycling over hills and deserts with othe sun beating down on him in such hot weather of June, he realizes he could get a heart stroke without water. His travels are desolate and lonely and when he finally sees building which are realy ghost towns he recovers and finds some determination to speed up. The cyclist luckily found a camp site to save him from passing out in a desert where he could rest, get water, then carry on his journey using his own map.	3	2		3																					
1707	3	"The young cycolist began his day confident in looking forward to his day of riding across california, slowly, however as he recognizes his been directed wrongly, his mood changes,& he begins to feel more hopless. AS he begins, he feels carefree & mody for anything. He writes ""I checked, checked my water supply & moved on. The sun was beginning to heat down, not I barely noticed it. The surroundings have little effect on him. Later, on he realizes his water was going down, & he is getting tired, his mood changed to exhaustion & defect. Here he writes �i got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles & stuch them in my mouth with any luck I�d hit a bump of lodge one in my throat.� He has become sarcastic of saddened by the hoplessness of his journey. Eventually, he had relief of the cold water helps to bring up his spirits & sense of humor"	3	3		3																					
1708	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man�s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	2	2		2																					
1709	3	Weather, places, the will to continue � all are reason that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First the weather will affect the cyclist because in hot weather you lose a lot of water and you sweat a lot making it hard to pedal. The sunny hot weather will affect his will to ride.  I mean come on who wants to ride when its burning hot outside the places the cyclist went through like towns and rough roads would affect him because it�s pretty tough.	1	2		2																					
1710	3	The story �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted, speed limit � tells of a biking trip gone wrong. But the story would  not be as terrifying if it had happend in a different place. The setting plays a large role in the story. The story begins on a present summer evening but as the man bikes he arrives at ghost town devold of evil life, later feeling of double sets In when he arrives at �one ramshockle shed, severall rusty pumps and a corrol that couldn�t hold these lamest mule. � later we fear panic set in as these terrain becomes hilly and tumbleweeds and snakes cross the path. Like an cold wesstern. Finally all  hope is lost when he reaches these grapes Juice factory and fInd, �a sand blasted picture of a Young boy, � The setting is a power full tool which greatly influences the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
1714	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is on his way trying to find his way to Yosemite National Park, but runs into a little trouble when getting directions from a couple of older men. The one lesson the cyclist learned was to never to listen to short-cuts given to you by old men who are extremly out of date and haven�t left their pourch since Carter was in office. The cyclist learned this the hard way when he ends up lost and almost died of thirst. The setting takes place in the desert of California or in deserted ghost towns. One his journey the cyclist says ��I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This feature effects the cyclist because of the extremely dry heat beating down on him makes him dehydrated. Also along his journey the cyclist encounters hills. The feature of the setting effects the cyclist by tiring him out and making him believe there isn�t any hope of him getting out alive. Features of the setting like hills and deserts dehydrates a	2	2		2																					
1718	3	The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First comes the windy roads. As he goes along his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. �Not the miley into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. �This shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is over whollmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before hagon up, he found a place to get water and to relax. �Then, as easily as running about, my troubles thirst, and nor were all behind me� This shows that he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and it made happy and have a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined.	3	3		3

1725	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist; the author says he is in the California desert. This means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the trip. Also, there are many hills, as the author says, �over one crippling hills�� with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist uses up more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he isn�t careful. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other. This again affects how the cyclists uses his water, he thinks that there is a prospering town coming up, so he drinks his water, thinking he�ll get more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he must pedal seveal more miles to the next town with very little water. The setting is a great effect on how the cyclists act especially with no water.	2	2		2																					
1726	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affect the cyclist. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to,his determination increases and decreases. For example, when he saw a building come into view ahead of him, he got excited and used all his energy to get down the hill to the building. Also, when he came to the next building and found a working bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting. 	2	3		3

1736	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, it concludes the story with a good ending. In the story the girl buys a Hibiscus that remainds her of home. She goes home & tells her mother she failed her test but bought the plant. While she was planting it she seen geese and she was reminded of home. America was like home and she was happier. In the text she says, ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now."" She is willing to give the test another try and is sure to pass it. America is now starting to feel a little more like home. "	2	2		2																					
1749	4	 In� Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the main character, saeng , undergos many obstacles as she tries to adapt to her new country , which is very different from her home. The author chooses to end the story, as,� When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 the author meant to end the story in this fashion to ensure the reader that saeng has found new hope , which symbolized by the hibiscus flower.Now along with  budding  new hope, the flower also carries a sentimental value ,about her home .Sometimes ,the best way to overcome your obstacles is to embrace them, as she did in the greenhouse ,then   that leaves room to start anew.	2	3		3																					
1752	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, the author ends with the last specified paragraph, �When they came back�then I will take that test again.� because it leaves many un-answered questions the reader might have. The reader then might want to read her next piece of work. Basically, the last paragraph drows attention to the reader. many of the unanswered questions revolve around, �I failed the test.�. We also do not know �her gentle grandmother�, �mrs.Lambert�, and �home�. Another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have a effect on the reader. The reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What will happen? All we know is, �when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader. This is why, I believe the author of �Winter Hibiscus� ended with the specified paragraph.	1	2		2																					
1753	4	I think that she ended the story like that because it means that she is getting used to all the seasons. �In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hisbiiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� She will and take the test once its not cold anymore so she will wait until the geese come again which will be spring by then. I think that she is also trying to say that when the snow melts and the geese are there again she will have taken the test and pass it. This is I think she ended it like this because how they mean something to her.	1	1		1																					
1758	4	The author concludes the story with his par paragraph because. She will take the test in the spring and she will do her best. She said �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. By failing a test. doesn�t mean. that its not end of everthing. She will have more confidence next time she take the test.	1	1		1																					
1762	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted to show just cause saeng failed that test don�t mean she giving up. she said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take it again. what the author means that right now she has failed but over time she can study and learn more to get ready to re take it. And by the time she ready to take the test the snow with have went away every should be hot out the birds come back and the flower is growing fine. she  will take it. And how author ended it lets us know she going to take it but how he use the words let us know that she will not only take it but pass it too.	2	1		2																					
1763	4	The author concludes the story with that because the hibiscus started budding and she�s happy now. So she�s saying after the geese come back and the snow melt, she�s to do all over again.	0	0		0																					
1765	4	the author added that sentence to the story to show how much Saeng cared about the snow and the plants. She says that she much rather do gardening then school work. She loves planting new things.	0	0		0																					
1769	4	I belive the author concludes with that quote for an assortment of reasons. One is to show that the charecter isn�t just going to give up, that her failing wasn�t the end for her. This shows sorting like morale of never giving up. It feels as the character is referring to the hibiscus as sensely. �The hibiscus will be budding�   which means that she herself will branch out and learn more. By the spring time she would have learned enough and experienced enough to try to pass the test again. The hibiscus also reminds her of her home. When she will look at it she will find the courage to pull through and to face her challenges like her test.The ending quotealso wraps up the story.It also shows the charecters will of not giving up and to always try.	2	2		2																					
1774	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won�t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point.	1	1		1																					
1778	4	�Winter Hibiscus �is about a girl saeng, who moved from Vietnam to the @ORGANIZATION1. After she fails her driver�s test. She walks home and finds a hibiscus. �She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long gray hair�� She goes to a flower shop to see if it can be purchased. She pays a lot of money for the plant because it is rare and valuable. It is special to her because she used to have hibiscus plants in Vietnam. She brings the plant home & tells her mom that it reminds her of Vietnam. The mom says that it reminds her of Vietnam too. The mom is not happy with how much saeng paid for it. She plants it in her garden.� When the hibiscus was lowered in the ground, a flock of geese flew by.�When the hibiscus returns in the spring,  saeng will take her driver�s test again. In the spring, all the flowers start to bud and bloom. Everything is new again. saeng will have a new chance to pass her test.	2	2		2																					
1781	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows Saeng passion for gardening. How she�s willing to take the test is to see if her plants can grow when spring comes around and the hibiscus starts to bud she will attempt to grow it which shows how anxious Saeng is for gardening and to try and get the hibiscus to grow during the spring.	0	0		0																					
1782	4	The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.	1	1		1																					
1783	4	Change and disappointment are enough to over-come. Some people have an arid fear of change. For Saeng the main character from �winter Hibiscus,� change comes in the form of a move to @LOCATION1. Everything around her is different and new. Coupled with disappointment of failing her driver's exam, the feeling of living helpless overwhelms her. After buying a winter hibiscus plant, she vows to take the test again when it blooms in the spring. The resiliance of the winter flower and the memories it represents inspire seng to try again.	2	3		3																					
1784	4	I think the author wanted to express Saeng when she took a vowed and to express the way he felt. When the statement was made that also I think it was to make readers feel interest in it but mainly to help understand.	0	0		0																					
1788	4	"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. Saeng missed her home. It was hard for her to say her country�s home without crying. ""It�s not like the wind we had at-at-."" She also spent @MONEY1 on a plant because it remind her of back at home. One could inter she adapted because she was familiar with the season change and it states when the geese return she is going to take the test again."	1	2		2																					
1789	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes Saeng feel more at home. For example it say, �the snow melt, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. �I think the author says this because all the thing in that sentence remind her of home. For example the plant the geese are things she had at home, so when winter is over she will feel better and take the test.  	1	1		1																					
1790	4	The reason why the author ended with Saeng vowed iS because she is very commited. She failed the first time but know she really want to pass it so she is waiting until the snow melt and @CAPS1 geese return and this hibiscus is buddin @CAPS2 she will come back	1	1		1																					
1794	4	In this story Saeng shows her mother how pasionate she is with planting and her pasionate for plants. The author includes the paragraph in the story so that it can show how the charact Saeng feels about her planting. One reason why this shows that she has passion for planting is because it says �I will try this test again� meaning that if she is doing something that she enjoys doing then she will try it again and again until she is fully pleased.	0	0		0																					
1796	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she has not given up on her dreams.	1	1		1																					
1798	4	The author is saying that she�s not doing nothing intell it is a nice day outside. Also she want it to be not that cold but not that not for she can come out and play with her children. Then she said she will take her test again for a nice day outside for her.	1	1		1																					
1800	4	The author might have concluded this story because it like a downfall. Which mean like right now he�s at the bottom and got to make it to the top. He is going to start over and take the test again, but thes time he is not going to fail.	1	1		1																					
1814	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has everything together. One way it ties everything together is by taking what had happen in the beginning and tieing it in with why she had bought the flower in the first place. Also it ties Saeng's old memories from Vietnam to her new way of life in the United States. The story states ""carefully Saeng dicked it up and smilled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. the familiar programe filled her lungs."" this is now the flower she found in the flower shop gave her memories from Vietnam. this is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1819	4	After Saeng fails her driver�s test, she gives up hope for the future. The sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up, no matter how tough the situation. In the story, Saeng�s mother says, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matters.� This quote shows how even though its not an object of beauty, it can do what it takes to survive. Saeng feels that she is also like the hibiscus, having the strength to be able to survive in a new environment. Even though she is new to this country, Saeng had proved that no matter how big the situation, anything can be overcomed if you believe in yourself and your family.	2	3		3																					
1820	4	The author probably used this as the last paragraph to show that at this time next year she is going to take the again. The author writes this paragraph to show that she failed the test when the geese were going away for winter and the hibiscus was blooming.	1	1		1																					
1821	4	The author concludes the end; of the story the way he/she did because it shows how much the plant truly means. S'aeng is going to wait till the flower blooms because it means so much to her. The flower represents her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive. The plant gives her hope for a new tommorow, a new chance. The last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl, its significance. It makes her feel more at home, and her home makes her feel stranger; makes her joyful and happy after the misery of failing the driving test.	2	2		2																					
1827	4	I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country. This is a good way to leave off the story because you don�t know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I also tink this is a good way to leave it off because he could write a sequal to it and make a series out of it.	1	1		1																					
1833	4	Hope, positivness, helpful all are reasons the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First, the last paragraph gives the readers a sense that Saeng has hope. I felt that she had hope because she is willing to take the test again. Since she is going to take the test again she wants to  help her mother. Second, the last paragraph gave me the feeling that Saeng has a positive attitude. She bought a flower to replace the dead ones, and she stated that she will re-take the test in the spring. Third, Saeng is helpful to her mother. Saeng finished digging the hole for the new flower for her mother, so her mom could go make dinner. Saeng also saw the feeling her mom felt when she found out Saeng did not pass the test. So she is re-taking the test. Saeng was feeling just about what any other new kid probably would have felt. She was scared, but through everything Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and she was helpful.	2	2		2																					
1834	4	To her the hibiscus was a test. Saeng felt she failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing �now.� The hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent over @MONEY1 on it, knowing she and her mother needed the money. Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test.	1	1		1																					
1837	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it adds the uplifting message that Saeng will be able to overcome the obstacles of living in an unfamiliar country. First; the @CAPS1 geese represent a piece of her new home because she reasons �reluctantly� that they are familiar to her now, This depicts her ability to adapt to her new environment. In addition, she also equates spring to when the habiscus is budding and the habiscus is a symbol of herself because both are trying to live in a country that is not their own. Therefore, the habiscus budding represents her being able to live comfortably in @LOCATION1. Finally, she vows that she will take her drivers test again. Her intial failure to pass the test showed her inability to become a part of @LOCATION1, but if she passes it. Then she will have successfully adapted. Overall, the author of this stoy concludes with this paragraph because it contains the theme of the passage through an uplifting message.  	3	2		3																					
1838	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong ho, the ending includes the hibiscus budding and retaking the test to make a connection between the two. The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go. The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her �budding� will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle.	3	2		3																					
1841	4	"The author concludes, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng doesn't want to give up yet. In the story Saeng mumbled, ""I mean, not like the kind at-at- ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. ""Saeng was still upset because she misses her home in Vietnam. When Saeng puts the hibiscus in the ground she feels more alive and Saeng wants to feel at home in the United States. Saeng isn't going to give up driving but to try, harder and harder to pass the test."	1	2		2																					
1843	4	�When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The story �winter hibiscus� ended with this paragraph because it will be a fresh start for Saeng. It will be spring out and the geese will come back to her home where she lives now, which now has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home. The paragraph also compares Saeng to the hibiscus. In the story her mother says, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matters.� Saeng is the winter hibiscus that�s strang enough to make it through winter and failing the test won�t matter until spring when she will take it and pass. That�s represented when the hibiscus is in bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saeng�s feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home. It�s also showing her ability to conquer obstacles. She is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring.	3	3		3																					
1844	4	I think the author concludes the story with that Paragraph because the hibiscus makes them over come obstacles. She wanted to take the test again so she can @CAPS1 to her mum that she can past it. I also, think that because the hibiscus gives them strenghth and she got more confident in herself to past the test.	1	1		1																					
1854	4	"There are many reasons wht the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. At first, the story begins with a tone of sadness and seing fact ""as Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test"" this quote sets the tone as sadness because she has failled a very important test and she is walking alone. ""She sees a familier plant"" is when the hope comes back into the story. When she brings the plant she had purchased here to her mother also sees delinlted. "" where did you get it?"" her mother aasked, and Saeng replied ""I bought it."" She bought it for @MONEY1 more then her mother said for all of the seeds in the garden. As time went on it was clear to her mother the plant signifies strength and hope to her daughter and endyat the plant with have as well I remember a time upon my mother bought me a work-candle cat desdion. I felt it was a waist of money, but when @CAPS1 saw her light delights for I it with love as well. When Saeng's mother felt have from thr plants made Saeng happy and gave her courage the driver's test again. is the reason why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. "	3	3		3																					
1859	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow�� to show that Saeng got stronger. She got, stronger because she adjusted to her new home and new environment. Saeng is more confident in herself to take the test again. She doesn�t want to cry again, like she did in her last test. Being more confident and more adjusted is the reason why she has become stronger, and the reason why she wants to take the test again is because she is stronger.	2	2		2																					
1865	4	@CAPS2, memories, hard @CAPS1 – All are reasons why the author conluds the story with this “When They come back, saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddng, Then I will take the test again. First @CAPS2 because she failed her test first so it takes some guts and will power to go back and even try it again. Also because when she remember her grandmother it upsets her so that definatly takes @CAPS2 and the human will power to do her test a second time. Next memories. I @CAPS4 she keeps wanting to do this test because she has had so many good memories with her grandmother and doesn’t want to ever forget them. But again goes back to the will power or the want to, to go back and do the test a second time. Last All the Hard @CAPS1. All the Hard @CAPS1 because She knows what her grandmother  ment to her and threw all the things or Hard @CAPS1 that her grandmother put out she saw and wants to honaor or apreciate all of the stuff that her grandmother did for her. These are the reasons that @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the author ended with that Paragraph rather than some other paragraph	2	2		2																					
1866	4	The author include s the last paragraph to show that she still has hope. it is the last sentence because @CAPS1  fong Ho wants to show that when all seems lost and your at the end of the line you can always hope for the better when spring comes so will a new beginning not only saeng�s plant but also for her life in a different country.	1	2		2																					
1869	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the reader compare the girl to the geese and the hibiscus. The geese leave for the. winter and then come back in the spring, however the geese also show how the girl is going to come back and take the drivers test again in the spring. The hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring, this shows that winter is its weakness. Like the hibiscus the girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by remembering her homeland. The author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so you can see that the girl is like the geese and the hibiscus.	3	2		3																					
1874	4	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant represent to being determined to survive. In other words, the hibiscus brings Saeng a good luck for her next driving test after winter season uhen the hibiscus is budding. Also, the reason why the author concluded the sentence to show what her plan for the future	1	1		1																					
1875	4	In the story �� Winter Hibiscus,�� the author concludes the story with this paragraph  for many reasons. This paragraph shows that Saeng  will not give up, she  will wait for next time  to come around to take the test. It also means she will be well prepared and will have a list  of  confidence in passing  this test. It gives the reader an idea that Saeng will not give up and she will complete the test. Her mother will be proud of her  for it and it shows Saeng will never give up. Just like when she said �let�s plant it, right now,�� T his example shows that even though Saeng had failed the the test and disapointed her mother,she will never give up and she still has hope in the plant just like how her mother has hope for Saeng.         	2	2		2																					
1877	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. In this story it about a @PERSON1, a girl and her mother. The girl is given money to buy a plant seeds. She spend @MONEY1 on this plant. Her mother get upset, but every thing turn on it, lk they had egg omlets with bits of melon.	1	1		1																					
1880	4	I believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think that the author will feel more confortable and ready to take the test. I was able to come to this conclusion because by waiting for winter to be over to take the test again, she is giving herself time to prepare. Also, she is waiting for the hibiscus plant to bud. Something. I was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus is the presence of confort, the whole story revolves around how saeng was able to confort herself by reminiscing on her past experiences in Vietnam. When she feels that an important part of her life is returning, that she can become comfortable and focused. I think the author would conclude the story with this paragraph is because the author wants to stress the importance of this flower involving how saeng lives her life	3	3		3																					
1882	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph he/she wanted to compare Saeng life with the plant. For example, in the story Saeng had just failed her driving test and then she saw a plant the reminded her of homeland. From the flower shop to the house, she is comparing her home land to the flower which shows how she relates to it. So the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase she will too and go for her drivers license.	2	1		2																					
1885	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the importance of new beginnings and to accentuate the theme in the story. The theme is that one must overcome hardships and seek new beginnings. The springtime is a representation of a new beginning. So, the new beginning of spring will allow her to start all over again on the drivers� test. Also, the author uses the paragraph to show the symbolic qualities of everyday things. Just how the hibiscus reminded her of home life, the geese will remind her of springtime.	2	2		2																					
1887	4	It�s kind of like a theme for the story. The hibiscuss inspire her to want to do things. I guess it brings memories of her home country and makes her want to try new things. This is significant to the story because it shows you how important the hibiscus was to saeng.	1	1		1																					
1899	4	The geese flying south for the winter and the hibiscus budding are normal things to Saeng. The author wanted to conclude the story with this to show that Saeng felt comfort in things that she was acustomed to. Saeng wanted to have the geese and hibiscus there to feel more comfortable while taking her driving test. Saeng still longs for home and does not quite feel like she fits in the u.s. The hibiscus gives her that comfort feeling like she is home again, in Vietnam, Saeng still feels homesick because she wants things to be how they were. The plants in the green house along with the disappointment of failing her driving test bring her to the emotional state that she was in. In the second to last paragraph the author talks about the feeling of repetition Saeng has when seeing the v formation. Saeng feels that in the winter she will not have the same comfort feeling as when she can see the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead. It says when Saeng arrived in the @LOCATION2 she had nothing that was familiar to her.  Now she gets that feeling from the geese and plants. The author concluding by saying Saeng will take her driving test when the winter ends is a good closing because it gives you some insight as to what Saeng is going to do.	3	2		3																					
1900	4	"I think the author concludes the sentence then they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geess and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" is that because it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese come back it will be spring, so it will be time to go back to school. I think thats the reason."	0	0		0																					
1903	4	The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningfull. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, �I will take that test again.� By use of the word will, the author shows the girls determination. She didn�t say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new begginigs. The story quotes, �when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again. This shows that in spring, the new begginig of life she will take the test. This is why I believe the author ended the story this way.	2	2		2																					
1908	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that�s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can�t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. �She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now�. Saeng didn�t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won�t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her. �She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" With Saeng�s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1909	4	The authour meerly states the obvious within this story of shortness. This exerpt mainly mainly means that when spring arrives she will return to the Green house or area with all the plants. When she gets there, the girllwill atempt to act the plant that grews wild in her home country and bring it to her new home.	0	0		0																					
1911	4	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph because to show how Saeng fills. In the paragraph Saeng said ""I will take that test again"" means will I go throught the same stuff. Also @CAPS1"	1	1		1																					
1914	4	Saeng feels more comfirtable in the spring because it reminds her of home. She probably never experienced snow or winter before. So nothing in this time of year reminds her of home. In the spring it does because the geese return and the hibiscus grow again making everything feel like its her home again. Conferdence is what she receives when spring comes again. 	1	1		1																					
1919	4	Saeng said that when the tree she bought starts budding she will take the test over. She means that without that plant she just does not feel like taking the test. She does not because the plant was with her, her whole life. She also thinks that she can not do it, without that plant. Saeng means that since she�s had a plant like that her whole life then she thinks she needs it, but I don�t think she really needs it. I guess it just �comforts� her.	1	1		1																					
1923	4	The author concludes. the story with this paragraph to show the story about snows on the roads. He shows people how to watch where they are going. In conclusion, the paragraph would show he made through the snow storm.	0	0		0																					
1924	4	In the story � Winter Hibiscus � Saeng vowes to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding. then I will take the test again. The author concludes   with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings her comfort from home and confidence. �Almost  familiar to her now.� This quote from the story shows that things are starting to be right and she is starting to feel comforting her by making her relize that where she is living now can be similar to where she used to live. When around the hibiscus it brings back memorys of the flowers that   they used to have where they lived. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home. For example, in the story the mother says �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here.� This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclution the author concludes this story with that paragraph because it helps readers to understand the importance of the  girls memory of where she used to live.	2	3		3																					
1927	4	The auther cncludes the story with this paragraph because it wraps it all up and sums it into one. It is explaining that she is looking forward to the spring when the hibiscuss is	1	1		1																					
1935	4	The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months. Meaning she�ll survive also. Although the flower isn�t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she�ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     	2	2		2																					
1936	4	The author concluded like that because he was the one to score the lines below what you write. Score of to level and key better. To all the thing he was surprised to kindly be seprated by for there by up so blese geve one a high sew o of will sweit all at you up to the end of the authrs concludes 	0	0		0																					
1939	4	Minfong Ho concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus� with a strong paragraph to show the passion and will of Saeng in her new home to complete the test. When the closing sentences states that Saeng �vowed� to pass the test, it shows her determination to fight. This will could be from the memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home. Saengs courage to face her homesickness is the seed of the story, and by ending it with such a bold statement, Minfong Ho blooms this seemingly sad tale into a story of willpower and drive to pass her test. �Winter Hibiscus� is a passage of heartache, despair, and yerning for a past life. By closing the story with the uplifting promise from Saeng, Minfong Ho puts a happy ending to a possibly sad tale.	3	2		3																					
1940	4	The author concludes the story with this because the season is ending and also the story is ending.	0	0		0																					
1948	4	The author ended the story with that because she is sad and she wants to give hope to the reader that you should never give up on any thing, always keep trying. Also it ends on a good note, if was like I stayed up in my @CAPS1 crying that would not be good ending. This ending gives hope to the reader and it also tells the reader to practice. This is because when spring comes a end the lady is going to practice driving so when she takes the test she want fail. Also the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy. So in conclusion that ending for story has a good choose for many reasons, like making the reader happy, giving the reader couage to never give up, end to practice something if you fail it the first time. Also to help your mother when she is planting or digging up plant,	2	2		2																					
1950	4	So she did not forget to take the test again.	0	1		1																					
1954	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph show is that Saeng is willing to try again to try to get a plant that will remind her of her grand mother and  remind her of her old home where she @MONTH1 go back one day . So, she can see the near flower she loves and not the take   one.	1	1		1																					
1963	4	When she is ready and good she is saying she will take the test again. When she is ready and good and it is nice and beautiful out then she will have the confidence to take the test again. The author was trying to tell us how she felt about letting her mom down.	1	1		1																					
1964	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it's important to the story. Also it closes the story up. Its exploning that the girl is starting to adjust to the new area, and is going to try harder to get along well there. So by saying shes going to take the test again. It means shes going to look at it in a new way. The authur put this at the end trying to make sense of everything and show the girl had changed.	1	1		1																					
1969	4	Why I think she added this is because she needs time to grow like the plant before she takes the test again. Sometimes you need more time to pass your test. going through school teaches more than stuff we need to know it helps us grow up, and how to understand life. I know myself as a tenth grader that I understand life more than I did in first. She still has a lot of growing mentaly about her past and preasnt.	1	1		1																					
1970	4	"I believe that the author ended the story with this line to show that hope for the girl was still there and that even perhaps the flower had inspired her a lot. I believe that when she says ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"", She specifically chose this time for her to start over, and try again just as everything else mentioned is. When it says, ""and this hibiscus is budding"", it shows that the flower is blooming again, with a fresh start and beginning again just as she would try to do when she tries again to succed at passing the test she must pass. also the tone of which said said this showed hope, she was hopeful and determined that next time around she would certainly pass."	2	3		3																					
1971	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that while this particular tale is over Saeng�s life will continue. The paragraph provides closure for the reader as well as explains that in time Saeng will take the test again, once she has further adapted to @LOCATION1 culture.	1	1		1																					
1982	4	"The story elds with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ""The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam. (for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world."") and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement."	2	2		2																					
1983	4	I think the auther concludes the story with the paragraph because it is saying I�ll never give up. She is determined to concor everything. I think she is saying she will take the test over and over until she succeeds. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because you should never give up.	1	1		1																					
1984	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author end the story saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying no matter what Saeng failed the drive test the first time she is not gaving up till she pass and get her driving. The author also concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying that Saeng can wait till winter end so she see the hibiscus is budding.	2	1		2																					
1986	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform what her hole meaning was. For example when she returned she felt great b/c she came back to were she belonged. One reason is what she �vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.� @CAPS1 meant that coming back was probably the best thing she could had done.	1	1		1																					
1987	4	well It seems like to me that the reason why the author wrote that as his or her ending is because basically to have sarcaism and put emphesis on what he was saying and making it clear that he wasn't going to take the test again, and basically if some one would haft to kill him in order to make him take that test again.	0	0		0																					
1989	4	The author puts that as the conclusion because it is like a cycle. And he didn�t finish it with the end of the cycle because leaving readers with that curiosity edge gives suspense. This was a well written story and conclusion.  	1	1		1																					
1993	4	The author includes that seterel paragraph because they wanted you to be able to visualize it in yor head rather than not seeing the picture. If you see a mental picture then it�s good at visualizeing.	0	0		0																					
2006	4	The author wrote this paragraph at the end of the story to symbolize a fresh start. I think this because when it is spring and the hibiscus is budding it will remind her homeland and she will take a fresh start at the test.	1	1		1																					
2018	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to conclude all the things they talked about in the story. In the story they talk about the spring time and now Saeng and her mother plants flowers and everything.	0	0		0																					
2028	4	The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, �In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  	2	1		2																					
2033	4	The whole story about Saeng buying the hibiscus is in response to her failing the driving test. This crushed her. She wants to be reminded of her old homeland where she did not read to past the driving lessons. So she goes to a green house to find plants that are similar to the ones she used to have in her homeland. She does this to try to make herself feel better but still �in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� Saeng feels she failed and the hibiscus gives her hope and memories of her old country. Her mom clearly sees and understands this when she doesn�t yell at Saeng for spending @NUM1$ on the plant. �I�m glad you got it,� Saeng�s mom says because she knows it comforts her daughter. Together the plant the hibiscus. By doing this they are planting Saeng�s hope to grow, not only to pass the driving test but to make it in the new country. *The story ends with those lines because Saeng decides if the hibiscus will grow then so will she. She will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she adapted. *The hibiscus, although it is not the one she had in the old country, she knows they can adapt to their surroundings and so the plant has in the new country. The plant will grow if it can adapt. Saeng can grow if she adapts to this new country.	3	3		3																					
2036	4	When the snow melts & the geese return then mean its almost spring.	0	0		0																					
2037	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the auther felt like she would be ready for the new test. In the text it states that after walking home after failing liner driver test, she sees a familiar plant. later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased That she will take the test again because she feel as thought she is confident to past it the next time around.	1	1		1																					
2039	4	They can compair the story and this statement to eachother because in the story the does not give up and the same thing with the test who even is taking to test again did not give up cause  they are taking it again.	1	1		1																					
2045	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng feels connected to the plant that reminds her of home. This connection is important because it shows how people can find ways to deal with changes in their lifes. Saeng does this by buying and planting the hibiscus plant so that she can see it and be reminded of home. She also buys the plant so that it motivates her to take the test she failed again in the spring when the flower is budding.	2	1		2																					
2051	4	The author concludes the story with, �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show Saeng growing up. As another year passes, Saeng will be more comfortable with her circumstances, and ready to start over fresh, just like all the plants will be blooming and budding. Failing her drivers test, really upset Saeng, so by waiting another year, she will be able to practice more, and become better, so that when she goes back and retests, she will be an even better driver, by having the time to practice, and start over. It�s almost like a new beginning for Saeng, another year has past, and new when her familiar plant budds, and begins to start over, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, she is better able to relate to it, and as it buds, and start fresh, so will Saeng. In conclusion, this is why the author concluded the story with that phrase.	2	3		3																					
2057	4	She says that because she had failed to keep the tropical plant a live.She was disappointed in herself and so  that  why  she  said. In  the  spring, when  the  snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this hibiscus is budding, then  I  will take  that  tes t again. When  she  failed  and her mother said it will be okay you can always try again.	1	1		1																					
2058	4	I believe that why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she is telling the reader and herself In my point of view that once again she do work in the garden to see if it catches her interest. I believe that the author is trying to express this because in the beggining of the story the author shows no interest in the garden or any interest of the world around her. For example when she was supposed to buy just seeds for the garden she went and used some of her mother�s money to buy herself a big mac. So In conclusion I believe that what I wrote clearly states how the author feels and why she ended they story the way she did.	1	1		1																					
2067	4	The girl, Saeng , seems to be attached to nature and enjoy it when the spring comes like she said, a new natural intenill start and she will be motivated to take the test that she failed again. The author most likely finished with this paragraph to show that there will be hope for Saeng and she will do what she has to do to have comfortably in her new home country. The whole story talks about how she is still unsatisfied with her new home but it would be cut to and the stay with new chances and a new life, which they did using springtime to show this.	2	1		2																					
2069	4	In the story �winter Hibiscus,� the author included important part at the end that saeng vowed. The reason why she said that is because when everything in her life starts up again she will love her life again, she will be alot happier person.	1	1		1																					
2070	4	The author in @LOCATION1 this because it is shows what is is going to do to he her gain failed and this story a what she must do get just from the geese	0	0		0																					
2082	4	In the story �winter hibiscus �by @CAPS1 Ho the storey ends with Saeng promising herself that she will take the test again in the spring. The author most likely ends this way because it shows how Saeng is getting over her sorrow test in the spring when the Hibiscus is in @LOCATION1. This is shown when Saeng says �I-I failed the test (@NUM1) this shows @CAPS2 leaving her homeland and makes her even more so sad, but she then promises herself that in the spring when flowers @LOCATION1 she will try again. She does this when she says to herself ��in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�(pg @NUM2) this shows her getting over her sorrow and becoming determined and looking forward and taking the test again.	2	2		2																					
2095	4	In the story �winter Hibiscus� by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it goes along with the story. In the story Saeng went to look for the pant that reminded her of her grandma. She found the plant and then she thought of her grandma and she cried. I think she was testing herself to see if she had gone on with her life but she failed. So I think she bought the plant so she can try again when the plant is in bloom.	1	1		1																					
2098	4	The author ended that story like that because that�s  how she started the story.The little girl was looking at the flowers and plants in the the beginning ,so the author thought that it would be a good thing to end the story like it was started.Also because the friendship that Saeng has with the plants and flowers will come back again in the spring when everything is blooming and looking very beautiful.It shows that the plants give a sense of comfort when she is going through hard times.That is why the author concludes with Saeng and the plants.	1	1		1																					
2100	4	Saeng vowed to herself that when the hibiscus begins to bud again she will take the test again. The hibiscus symbolizes hope to saeng that things can work out a second try. She concludes the story with the vow because, it expresses her last bit of hope. For example, the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country, with new surroundings but it also explains how she feels. She vows to show she won't give up despite of falling the first time. For example, �Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense , it was almost visceral �(Ho). This quote explains what the plant meant to her. This is why she concluded the story with a vow.  	2	2		2																					
2116	4	The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says �Saeng vowed silently to herself �which means she wants what is best for herself.	1	1		1																					
2117	4	Saeng believes that because she failed the driving test that she won�t be able the transition by a new country had she goes searching for her past. She finds her past in plants remembering Vietnam in deep sorrow. The narration states  �A were of less so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eye��(No) She remembers and misses everything she had she wanted her country her grandmother and her life. She came home to her mother with a plant and disappoint her mother with the cost but she understands the pain. The narration states �it�s a beautiful plant she finally said in sad you got it�(No). Eventually Saeng realizes how this plant affected her and how easily it survived and made a promise to herself. The narration states �and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agin   	2	3		3																					
2126	4	In the story ��Winter Hibiscus,�� the author ends the story with Saeng �s thoughts. The thought of trying the test when the hibiscus starts budding ties the story together. The story is mainly about how she looks for a flower and the memories it brings. But she wouldn�t have gone to the shop if she passed the test. This creates a full understanding of the test and hibiscus. It also shows the importance of the hibiscus. Both Saeng and the flower must adapt to survive and are out of place. Saeng was from Vietnam and the flower was from a shop, both were moved from where they belong to a new place.In some ways Saeng is the flower. She must adapt to her home to survive. The flower, outside in the cold, must adapt to its surroundings in order to survive. When she knows the flower survived the harsh winter, she will realize that she can survive living in @LOCATION2. This would make her feel strong and focused. 	3	2		3																					
2131	4	The reason why he concludes this with this paragraph is because he is telling how the story ends. The reason behind that is so people know's what happens.	0	0		0																					
2132	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to end the story on an optimistic note. Saeng�s problem is her �wave of loss� that sweeps over her during her memories of her home country. This entire story deals with Saeng�s depressing struggle with finding joy in her life in a new, unfamiliar and seemingly unwelcoming country. This feeling of loss and loneliness is magnified by the test then Saeng failed. After a story of such depression, the author shows @CAPS1 newly found confidence and optimism by ending the story with this paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2135	4	They author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want to see what people would say.	0	0		0																					
2139	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when it snows plants die and won�t grow back until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will she how her garden will be in the spring. Therefore the author put this paragraph in the end because Saeng loves gardening so much ever since she moved to the United States. Ever since the family moved to the United States the family has never been happier for being together having dinner and planting together they had the time of there life planting all the time.	1	1		1																					
2143	4	There could be many reasons the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It could be because Saeng wants to pass the test now to make her mother happy. It could also be because she will need to be able to drive in the next year for some reason. Maybe it�s because it cost her money to keep taking it. She really likes her hibiscus though.	1	1		1																					
2144	4	The author concludes the story in this way to show that Saeng is a determined undividual. It is symbolic for when the geese return she will take the test again because when they left she had failed. The snow melting and the hibiscus budding show spring and spring is usually the start of a fresh and new begininig. The last paragraph its like a symbol for starting fresh. Saeng was upset about failing the test �She said, �I�I failed the test.� By stuttering that shows she was upset. Since she was upset giving it time until she takes the test again is good. The author ended the story with this paragraph to show Saeng is strong and will have a fresh and new start.	2	2		2																					
2145	4	I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn�t feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way.	2	1		2																					
2148	4	The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved	2	2		2																					
2159	4	The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she�ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant.	1	1		1																					
2168	4	The author conclude the story with �When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�.because she wanted to grow hibiscus in the winter time. She had failed the first time and she wanted to redeem herself and do it the second time arround. She didn�t want to fail again so she did some things differently. She planted it with care patted the soil down firmly around the plant. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2169	4	The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom.	2	2		2																					
2173	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, ends by, �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author concludes that story with that quote because the author sees spring as a new beginning. The author knows to work hard and needs to starts over. For example, some students fail the second semester and look at winter as a new start.	1	1		1																					
2179	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� To show that the character has become a part of her new environment. Just like the environment, she is constantly going through changes, and in the spring when all things that couldn�t be their best during winter begun to thrive, she will too. And when she begins thriving and feels like herself again, then she�ll be ready to take the driving test, and pass. She�ll have returned to her old self like the geese return home when she's done crying like the snow� s done melting, and when she�s done crying like the snow�s done melting, and when she�s ready to open up, just like the hibiscus begin budding, she�ll be ready to take the test.	3	2		3																					
2185	4	I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she know she was wrong and she want�s to make it up to her mother. Also she is showing her mother how much she really likes nature.	0	0		0																					
2186	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed her driving test the first time and she was saying to herself that she will take it again.	1	1		1																					
2193	4	The short story �winter Hibiscus end the way it does because the narrator realizes that with simply comes a new chance or opportunity to start over a rebirth. One passage from the text that shows the narrator�s hope, �Almost reluctantly, she realised that many of the things that he had thought of as strange before, through that quiet repetition of season upon season,almost familiar to her now (Ho @NUM1). This passage of text shows that she realized that alot of things to her before suddenly had purpose. She realized that there is a new rebirth in the spring. The conclusion sentences states that she is going to retake the test in the spring. She now realizing that she now by a whole new opportunity and life to start. The conclusion sentence of �Winter Hibiscus� is one of realization of opportunity with spring beginning.	2	2		2																					
2197	4	The author concludes the story like that to make the reader more intrested and to understand it will all happen again and again year after year. 	1	1		1																					
2199	4	The auther ends the story in this way because it represents the new brith that will take place. It�s almost as if she�s saying that she will hibernate during the winter, and when spring returns and everything begins a new cycle of life, then so will she. Saeng �realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through queit repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� She is saying that when the new season begins it will be her beginning and she�ll have a different outlook on her new life.	2	2		2																					
2200	4	The author ends the story this way to wrap everything up. The author incorporated nature and descriptions of it. This was so the reader would get an image in their head of how �Beautiful or calming� spring supposively is.	1	1		1																					
2201	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it suggest that her strength will come when the flowers come and she will be able to take the test.	1	1		1																					
2203	4	The author concludes the story with When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because the hibiscus budding would symbolize starting over and Saeng taking the test again is giving her a chance to start over fresh and try again. The hibiscus doesn�t stop budding so Saeng shouldn�t stop trying!	2	1		2																					
2204	4	In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to say that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, @CAPS1 mother says �Its flowers aren�t pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months.� This is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months, in which the weather is rough. In Saeng�s case, she is a girl who will make it in a foreign country. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the drivers test again when the snow melts (writers over) and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph. 	3	3		3																					
2210	4	This is a powerful sentence that demonstrates themes in the story. Saeng is determined to try again because she has been comforted by symbol of her homeland. This sentence shows what the plant has done for Saeng�s spirit and shows how that symbol helps heal her. The sentence is able to wrap up the story and demonstrates the importance of the hibiscus. In the story @CAPS1 describes the plant as a friend and remmeder of her homeland. Once she sees the plant in bloom she`ll know that she can take the test again. The paragraph is a great conclusion to the passage because it summarizes everything that the hibiscus has meant for Saeng.	2	2		2																					
2220	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to show that the peace that the peace that the flower gave will build her confidence and she will not give up. I know this because in the story the main character fails her driving test and when she sees the flower it helps remind her of the home she had in Vietnam. Another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and it never stops blooming. She knows it will never give up and she relaizes that she shouldn�t either. Plus the plant gives her stength to try again. So the reason the author ends her story with that paragraph is to show the power the flower that was know to her, give her and how she will no give up.	2	2		2																					
2223	4	I think she ended the story with that because throout the wole story she trys to work hard. And this last sentence is saying that its not over, That she will be back to take the test again. She trys to prove herself during the whole book. And she will continue working hard to get what she wants  	1	1		1																					
2227	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus"" I believe they end the story the way they did, �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� because with saeng making a goal, she�s overcoming her disappointment and uncomfort living in a new country. The archetyple meaning of a flower bud is: prosper, new, growth. This shows he growing and that�s important in life and that�s why the ended it the way they did. It�s a positive ending."	2	2		2																					
2247	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph why @CAPS1 it might be important to the author about Saeng. It some thing personely about her past or where she had came for. She trying to say that when she come back in the spring she going to take the test again in school. OR She is going to plants something over again the spring @CAPS1. As snow @CAPS2 and its too cold to plant any thing. That where she came from is really important to her and she miss it and went to go back to where she Come from. 	1	1		1																					
2253	4	The last paragraph at the end of the story was the authors way of showing how Saeng wanted spring to come early because she wants to see her hibiscus. If spring doesn�t come fast she will not get to see her hibiscus and the snow won�t melt. When Saeng comes up she hopes she can take the test.	1	1		1																					
2254	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn�t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."	2	2		2																					
2262	4	The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.	2	2		2																					
2264	4	It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, �This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader.	2	3		3																					
2270	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of what about her test? Needed to be answered and that�s when she'd to comfortable to take it. In the text. To her, the plant felt smooth and cool just as she had known it, which was comforting. She closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, with sadness, and maybe disapointment, which she probably word want to deal with for a while, hinted at in the conclusion her mother even uttered a small cry of surprise and delight to see the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid all of over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I believe that she will be more comfortable at the time. planned because she'll have new and old things to come home to, such as the geese and plant.                	2	1		2																					
2280	4	I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,� In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .� mean that when all is @CAPS1 .� She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don�t even know what she  failed  so I didn�t  like it.	1	1		1																					
2291	4	"I beleive the author ends the story with this paragraph because it refers to previous events in the story. For example it says, ""and this hibiscis is budding"". This refers back to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it reminded her of home. This is a good way to conclude a story. I wouldn�t change it at all if I could. Also in the summary before the story it says how she had failed her driver�s test and in the last paragraph it says, ""then I will take that test again,� I think Saeng didn�t have much confidence before taking the test because of her new surroundings but is now that she is familiar with everything and found a hobby she will think of passing while taking the test again. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failing.  "	2	2		2																					
2297	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and in the spring she will take the test over.	1	1		1																					
2299	4	Saeng was taking a test and she didn�t quite pass it She was afraid to tell to her mother but she has to tell her anyway. Her mother got upset because she didn�t pass it. Saeng knows  that right after winter's over, She�ll be taking that same test again and she hoped she will pass it this time.	1	1		1																					
2300	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.- �I mean its not the kind we at-at-� she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home.	3	2		3																					
2308	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the driving test in spring time. Spring time is a symbol of positive feelingsshe gets positive feelings from the blooming of the winter hibiscus.	1	1		1

2324	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. The author wanted to convey a sense of hope to show the growth of her character, and to show how thing are  going to change. In the last paragraph when she vows that she will take that test again it gives you a sense that everything will be okay. Earlier in the story she had been crying and missing her homeland the tone was troubled and sad. This last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful. Even though she failed the test she is still going to try again. The author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grow. Saying that she will try again shows how much stronger determed she is lastly, she had the story end with that paragraph to foreshadow what is to come.The geese coming back and the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding all show a change in the seasons. This represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on.	3	3		3																					
2325	4	The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal. It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think.	1	1		1																					
2329	4	The  author  of  the  passage  ends  the  story  with this  statements  to  creates curiosity. Thi creates curiosity through writing for the spring and the geese to return.Spring is the beginning for many creatures on  the earth  therefore ,Saeng  is  trying  to  start  over  because  she  must  wait  for  the spring. The hibiscus reinforces the feeling of a new beginningin that each year new bad grow just  like  she can have a second chance. Saeng  waits for  the  spring  because she knows that is when every thing else creates new life so Saeng must wait till then to get her new beginning	2	2		2																					
2331	4	The author includes this scentence, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show her determination. She is determined to pass the test. Even if she is facing problems adapting to @LOCATION1 she wents to sucseed here. So she will wait a year and then try again when she is better prepared.	1	1		1																					
2333	4	The author concludes this paragraph because he wants to make it more clearer so the readers would understand It more. And so he could, make it better to stand out. 	0	0		0																					
2338	4	"The author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story. �I will  take that test again,� This is the test that she had failed that day. The test that she failed tested her memory of her home. Her old country was so important to her. The part in the quote,� when they come back.... when the show me it and the geese return,� is referring to when she says,� She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become � almost familiar to her. Like the geese,� She is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to like the geese that fly south every winter.� When she uses ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" she is saying how she will remember all the things she has forgotten when she moved over here to this country.� When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center �just as she had known it would feel. This whole statement is basically saying  that she is starting to forget things in her country as this country becomes more familiar but when the geese return meaning in the @DATE1 then she will remember again and she will take that test again of her knowledge and pass."	1	2		2																					
2340	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng had failed her drivers test and was very unhappy. She also disliked her new home. �She was still too shaky to say at home� she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up. After talking to her mother, it renewed her hopes so the author uses this paragraph to signify that she still have hope in the end and when she is ready she will try again. �When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.�  	2	1		2																					
2347	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because the narrarator is now willing to accept and adapt to her new environment like the flower and the flower would do. Geese like the warm and not the cold so they are flying south for the winter. Saeng�s �comfort tone� is in @LOCATION1 where she has many childhood memories; including her grandmother and the hibiscus flower. She is used to the flower being in a warm environment. So, when the geese come back in the spring and when the flower blossoms again, she will be ready to adapt to @CAPS1 life more and take her drivers test. The geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory of her old home in @LOCATION1 which she misses very much. After these things come to try and adapt to @CAPS1 ways of life. 	3	2		3																					
2349	4	In the passage �winter hibiscus� the author uses this phrase in the last paragraph �when they came back, Saeng vowes silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. I believe she concluded this story with these words she change because she is saying to you in that means when the birds flewaway. Even the bird seasons would be back like always. An example of this is when she says the birds eased into the hibiscus. Mingled because the last paragraph thinking that she would stay again next season and keys very what she likes to do. This what I get out as the last paragraph are the story �winter hibiscus� as what it means to me.	2	1		2																					
2351	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show saeng�s determination to survive and be happy in her new home. Although she isn�t happy with her purchase she is trying to make it seem more homey. When  she says �will take that test again�she shows how she wants her surroundings to be comfortable. By ending with this paragraph it also shows a strongness in seasons. As it saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring. This paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends. The  plant is like a symbol of how she is going to change she is going to investigate and pass her own test proving she diserves to be happy and make herself feel at home.	2	2		2																					
2355	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with, �When they come back take that test again. �She does this to show that she still has hope, and won�t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. �@CAPS1 I will take that test again.� (shows hope).�And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.  	2	2		2																					
2359	4	The author of this story ends the story with this paragraph because it explains how Saeng will not give up, just as the hibiscus does not. Earlier in the story, it explains how the winter hibiscus does not die. In the paragraph, when it says, the snows melt, this means that the seasons will keep going, just as Saeng should keep going and trying. Also when the author says and the geese return, this means that the geese will keep coming back just as Saeng should keep trying to take the test.	2	2		2																					
2360	4	I belive the author used these lines in the last paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 he realy liked it.	0	0		0																					
2361	4	I think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story.The author could of wanted to show more details in the story.	0	0		0																					
2362	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how she will start over by retaking the test, just as the hibiscus will start over by budding new flowers. Saeng shows us how she will try to overcome the obstacles she must face, just like the hibiscus flower and geese will overcome the winter. In the story, the author makes the hibiscus represent the way to adjust to the changes in life. In a way, the winter hibiscus represents Saeng because the flower is adapting to circumstances, the circumstance being winter. Just like the hibiscus flower, Saeng must overcome her obstacles of being in a new country, and retaking her drivers exam.	2	2		2																					
2365	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng�s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng�s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test.	2	2		2																					
2369	4	The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: �I mean, not like the kind we had @NUM1at-�. This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows that Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude his story like he does.	2	2		2																					
2375	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� because it shows That Saeng isn�t going to stay down. It shows That The hibiscus will overcome winter, like Saeng�s mother says,�'�but its strong enough to make it Through the cold months here, This winter hibiscus That�s what matters.� This symbolizes Saeng overcoming not only failing The driver�s test, but also moving to @LOCATION1. She isn�t The same as she was back home, but she�s strong enough to get Through This change in her life. Also, taking The test in the spring symbolizes starting over, when everyThing is new, and she has overcome her winter. This ending paragraph is so important because it shows Saeng�s promise to herself That she will get past The challenges in front of her, and @CAPS1 to come. When Saeng says �...When the snows melt...� it symbolizes The time in her life when her failures will become good again. She will take The test with a new out look on her life. The author concludes The story with This paragraph because it shows That Saeng isn�t going to stay down.	3	3		3																					
2379	4	The reason  why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because they wanted the reader to know there will be another story that will be made up. Also to show that Saeng was not happy that the snow melted and the geese return and the hibiscus was budding.	1	1		1																					
2381	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome. What the @CAPS1 �In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� It means she�ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she�s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it.	1	1		1																					
2386	4	I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  	1	1		1																					
2387	4	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower�s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower�s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages	3	3		3																					
2394	4	The Author concludes this story With the @CAPS1 paragraph to emphasize the story and make it seem more interesting as to make the reader want the story to keep going on to find out what happens next.	1	1		1																					
2402	4	The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season.	0	0		0																					
2403	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined. For example, saeng failed her driver�s test but upon reaching the hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her old home. Also, while she is planting the plant, she sees the geese with a new familiarity. This combined makes her determined to complete her test because having two reminders of both homes, it comforts her to know that she can adapt easily and treasure her memories as well.	3	2		3																					
2406	4	He is referring to the lifestyle of Saeng and the stuff they do. And what the area is like weather wise.	0	0		0																					
2410	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn�t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that�s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things.	1	1		1																					
2412	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is Finally comfortable with her new �home.� After the passage is mostly a reflection of Saeng�s old life, it ends this way to signify that she has become accustomed to her new way of life. For example, it says �in the spring, and the geese return�� that shows that she is now used to the geese and the nature of her new world. The author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release. Saeng had so many memories locked inside her old life, that she couldn�t grasp new ones in her new home. The authors use of this paragraph is a good way to close out the story because it lets the reader feel the relaxed scene of the birds flying away; Saeng escaping  her pain and becoming  a real part of her new world.  	2	3		3																					
2414	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show Saeng�s determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when she�s in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, �It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.�	2	2		2																					
2417	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as a way to say that in due season she will take the test that she failed in the belief that the hibiscus will help her to overcome the obstacles. I believe that she she bought the plant when she failed the test, that she hope that with the blossoming of the plant, I will give her a time table as to when she is ready to try again.	1	2		2																					
2420	4	"I think the author of �Winter Hibiscus� finished with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, �because it is showing us the importance of the plant and how it will help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return� the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says �Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance�. This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again�, because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started."	3	3		3																					
2421	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has meaning. The author is saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance she too, will get hers. For example, the geese will get to return, the hibiscus will get it's chance to bud and she will get her chance to take her drivers test. I know this because Saeng�s mother starts talking about how great the plant will be in the spring. She even says, �But its strong enough to make it through the cold months�. This indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance. That is why the story ends with that sentence.	2	2		2																					
2434	4	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that�s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story	1	1		1																					
2436	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus"", the auther finishes the story with this last paragraph, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again. The auther finishes the story with that paragraph because in the beginning, Saeng had purchased hibiscus plant because it had reminded her of her hometown. (�Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world�) So she purchased it, but since there was bad weather at the time, Saeng had to get the plant back in time and plant it in the graden. But she failed setting if there on time. That is why it says �I will take that test again"". And she will take it again during the spring when the hibiscus blooms once again. That is why the auther finished the story with that paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2440	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with an interesting paragraph. The paragraph says� When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding  then I will take that test again. ""The author ended the story with that paragraph because she was not in her comfort zone, she had move to a new country and missed everything like the flower and the Hibiscus. So she would wait until she felt at home and comfortable again to retake the test. In the text it states �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� She was realizing that it wasn�t so bad & she was getting used to it."	2	2		2																					
2441	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� so that the audience has something to think about, it gives the story a little more of a dramatic effect.	0	0		0																					
2442	4	The author concludes the story this way to show she will be alright, and remain determined. The way she speaks of future times shows confidence that she will make it till spring. The way she speaks of the test shows her determination. The use of the word �vowed� shows she will follow through with her statement.	1	1		1																					
2444	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the flower is told about all through the story and the author puts when the hubiscius is budding then I will take that test again.	0	0		0																					
2445	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she is telling us what will happen beyond the story we are reading. It means when the snow melts, she�ll start all over again and rebuild the greenhouse.	0	0		0																					
2446	4	I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is �almost familiar to her now� (@NUM1).	1	2		2																					
2449	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, �I failed the test,� (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence.	1	2		2																					
2452	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author�s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph.	1	2		2																					
2460	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph ""When they come back,� then I will take the test again because Saeng needs time just as the hibiscus to grow. Saeng didn't do well on a test but says she will try again after snow melts and the spring comes. After moving Saeng feels alone and wants to go back home but she feels in her heart that she can try given time. The hibiscus remines Saeng of the flower back in her home country this helps her see that she has to let go of her past and live in the now."	2	2		2																					
2465	4	"The author concluded this story with this paragraph because she wanted show how the flower gave the little girl strength. The girl was in a new place and back at home where she is from there are alot of beautiful flowers that she loved to look at and being in a new place that doesn't have these flowers really gets her down and has her upset. She misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers. For example, the girl says, �It�s-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", here she stops because she is so upset that she can�t say home. The flower she has right now isn't real but when the real one blossom in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her confidence to retake the test."	2	2		2																					
2467	4	The author ends with this paragraph to show gthat Saeng had. Hope. It shows that there is still hope. The ending paragraph makes you  kind of create your own ending for Saeng. I like to imagine Saeng with a big garden next to her and and she passes the test.	1	1		1																					
2472	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it.	2	2		2																					
2474	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was how he wanted the story to end. He wanted to end the story with her talking to herself.	0	0		0																					
2476	4	Because she was promiseing herself that when spring comes back then she will take the drivers test agin.	1	1		1																					
2478	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to explain how she already took the test and it is now winter, she will retake the test again when all of the flowers and plants come back to life and start again. Saeng wants to take the test again to show her mother that she can pass it, she bought a plant called. dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars to help her mother not be disapointed. However mother was disapointed that she spent that much money on a plant. 	1	1		1																					
2482	4	I believe that the author concludes  the story with this paragraph because it says that Saeng is confident and is willing to go back and take the test. Saeng feels good about her self and wants to do this.	1	1		1																					
2483	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. In the story there are some quotes to support my response �I-I failed the test� Saeng said.� This shows that she was taking a test about gardening. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life of it to them. The paragraph talks about spring, and flowers. The daughter and mother live off of the plants by planting vetagables, and fruits.	0	0		0																					
2488	4	I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on	0	0		0																					
2489	4	I think the author includes this because she doesn�t want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then �I will take the test again.� This quote is saying she @MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you don�t no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng @MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.	2	2		2																					
2491	4	The reason I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph was because it was a good learning story you can learn something from it .The author did that so you can get a better understanding of the of the story. It said �saeng .teenage  girl, and her family have moved to the united states of Vietnam.� So from reading that it tells me that its telling you what happen right before the story took place. So you can get a better understanding. To me its rapping it all up for you. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2499	4	I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back.	0	0		0																					
2500	4	The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to, a place where she didn�t like and knew No one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what don�t give up, have faith. At the end Saeng has faith in herself that she can past the test next time. She @MONTH1 have realized that just because your at place you don�t want to, it doesn�t mean you can�t go on.	1	2		2																					
2501	4	The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. That�s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that.	1	1		1																					
2503	4	The author concludes saeng vow in the story to show that saeng can and does have the ability to overcome obstacle. Saeng  feels like she is a failer. Her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her driving test that she failed. The geese represent survial and to never give up, to keep trying your hardest to success.	2	1		2																					
2506	4	There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it�s the end of the story so it�s a good way to end it because it�s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it�s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It�s not like most endings to a story so it�s unique. Because most stories aren�t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2507	4	"The author concludes the story with his paragraph to show how people can regain their determination. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. When she sees the Hibiscus, she is filled with memories of the past and weeps. Her mother's kindness causes Saeng to draw strength from the flower, which, as her mother says, is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" @CAPS1 that the Hibiscus will bud in the spring, Saeng renews her determination to pass the test. "	2	2		2																					
2520	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sums everything up and solves the conflict of her failing her driver's test. When Saeng said ""� I will take that test again"" it showed that she is determined to pass the tes and will try again. Since the conflict is solved there you pretty much have to introduce a new conflict to keep the story going so the author just ends it. This excerpt from the last paragraph also incorporates Saeng difficultly to that geese because just as geese faces hardships getting her driver lisense. But also like the geese she will go back her face hardships again. "	1	2		2																					
2523	4	She said this too show the determination it takes to make it no matter how many times you fail you need to get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this way also, it takes alot for someone to fail something and to get back up and try again on it. She isnt willing to accept failure, and she's trying to redeem her failure so she says she'll try again. That is why she ended the story that way.	1	1		1																					
2533	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph -� when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� (@NUM1) because she feels that when the hibiscus blooms she can too bloom by passing the test. Also Saeng is relating herself to the hibiscus. �Its� flower arn�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it throu in here, this winter hibiscus.� (@NUM1) Her mother is trying to tell her she can be strong also. She too can make it through the cold months. �like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etered against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.� (@NUM1) Just like the geese Saeng is realizing to be proud of herself and there will be other chances. Don�t always doubt yourself becase they will be other chances. Don�t be afraid to try again.	2	2		2																					
2537	4	He author concludes this paragraph in this story because It sounds good and to show the people he is writing it to that no matter what happend s to you in life you should Just keep on doing what you think is best for you. Just like the flower she keeps coming back for more after going through all that�s tuff. 	1	1		1																					
2542	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because at the end is talking of a new begining. Also what it�s going to be at the new begining she says that she is going to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2543	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind because she found  a  flower that reminds her of homeland. She is afraid that her parents  are going to be mad at for not passing the test, therefore she  buys  a  flower  that she sees for it remind. When she gets home and telling her mom how much she paid for the flower  and  how  she  didn�t  pass, mother is upset for only a second, then she is understanding of what her  daughter is going throgh. By the end  of the story she has  more confidence  that  she  will succeed next time.	2	2		2																					
2544	4	"Minfong tto ended the story with aphrase dialogue because it was about the main topic of the story. Saeng was to buy a plant and bring it home, but when she did so, her mother did not approve. The narrative states ""You what?"" Her mother stared at her incredulously""(Ho ). When her mothesaid this, it showed that she was displeased. The narrative states, ""I-I failed the test""(Ho). Saeng was not proud to displease her parents in any way. By saying, ""When hey come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return  and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again""(Ho), the author is just showing Saeng's love and want to grow foe her parents; it shows maturity. "	2	2		2																					
2547	4	The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One reason is to show Saeng is not going to give up and keep trying to pass her test. Another way is to show that even though your life has changed that don�t mean that you have to give up. These are some of the way that the author concludes the story like he does.	1	1		1																					
2550	4	She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring.	1	2		2																					
2553	4	The authoR concludes the stoRy with that sentence b/c she wanted to explain to you that she will do this again when the hibiscus is back in season.	1	1		1																					
2555	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means that when she gets older and gets more confidence then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready just like the hibiscus will be ready to start to budding again.	1	1		1																					
2560	4	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. This is done to symbolize the many things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were �strange before [and] had become familiar to her now�. The hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed. The last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learnt.	2	2		2																					
2563	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because the author is trying to say that Saeng is going to start all over again just like the hibiscus would. Even though you go through bad times in your life just step and do it over again until it becomes better. The author also concluded the story with that paragraph because the paragraph pretty much starts the story all over again that like Saeng was going do.  	2	2		2																					
2576	4	The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, with the strong paragraph of one sentence starting that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This sentence leaves the reader in suspense while incorporating the main point of the story and combining them to express an idea about what might happen in a continuation on the future of @CAPS1 and this story. After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort her mother and her-self. While she stood watching the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng�s feelings to stay determined and take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a string sentence which not only summerized the story, but left a cliff hangs.	3	2		3																					
2580	4	After they come Saeng  was  silently  to herself , In the spring , when the snows melt  and  the geese return and  the hibiscus  is Saeng  then  I am  take that test again.  She  say this sentence she is herself back to home .She  thinks  it familiar to Saeng  was. She  is herself  how  quiet it vowed  to  so  every season . Her live is very quiet and leavy . She feels  as  of place .  Due to failing her driving test things herself  was thing for her to united state was so different from vietnam and she expresses  her  feelings  will she talk a about this something flower.   	1	1		1																					
2581	4	The author conclude the story with this paragraph because the author wants to remind the reader and summarize the story. The way she wants to summarize is how the story started with Saeng failing the test to how the story endend with saeng planting the hibiscus in the winter. The author wants to remind the reader about the whole story.	1	1		1																					
2585	4	In the story �winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says �let me help mother.� This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng�s commitment.	2	3		3																					
2592	4	I think that the author ends this story with that paragraph to some up what the story was all about and to also say that Saeng would try the test again. In the story it says �she realised that many of the thing that she had thought of as strange before had become, though the quiet repetition of season opon reason, almost familiar to her now and this last paragraph help bring all this together.	1	2		2																					
2598	4	Saeng  ment  that she will take that test  next  spring and pass it with the hope of her winter flower  and  the  sight of her flock of geese  she  has high hopes that she will pass her test . when  she sees buds  on her hibiscus then she will take the test again. Saeng was very upset when she failed it the @CAPS1 time and she was hoping  she  passed  next  spring.	1	1		1																					
2600	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, �It�s flowers aren�t pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. �It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng should be strong even I times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, throught the quiet repition of season upon season�� It shows that saeng realized that the new place that she�s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home � In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be  strong and follow the flow of life.	1	2		2																					
2601	4	�In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibisus is budding, then I will take that test again� Saeng thinks to herself. Saeng finds herself in a new place were she has no friends. She finds comfort in a plant shop one day when she comes apon a Hibiscus flower. The flower calms her spierit and helps her beguin to adjust to the changes in her life at this time.	2	1		2																					
2605	4	In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose the to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, �when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. Saeng�s situation is similar to the flower�s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home   	3	3		3																					
2616	4	Saeng promises herself that  �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agan.� The hibiscus is meta phorica to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of her homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, �that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become� almost familiar to her now.� She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable.	1	1		1																					
2625	4	The reason the author of �Winter hibiscus� ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end  of a moderatly depressing story. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving foreward.  And that the end of your world comes when you make it so. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end.	2	1		2																					
2626	4	The character has what seems to be a new found confidence and a new joy of the plant that reminds her of her home land comforting her and motovating her. She says when those things come back she will try hard to complete the test. She is setting a time to push herself.  As most people try to do	1	1		1																					
2631	4	The reason why the author of the story ended the story like that is because after all the hard time that plant went through, it will still bad at the end of the winter. The author said that the plant will take that test again that test is surviving through the could winter and blunming at the end of the winter	1	1		1																					
2635	4	Explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Cause it all make a little cent to concludes the story with this. Here why I think it does. The paragraph in the one of the main pieces to to the story. �In the spring, when the snows melt and after return,� all she say is is when the snow is gone and the grass come back, I will start planting again and she would be happy with it, �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again,� she went to put her plants up again and tests them to see how them over so she can do them even again. Saeng loved this plant so much that she can�t wait. But when it does she is going to plant a lot. That what the paragraph is saying Saeng is going to wait so he can plant a hibiscus. However, since she came to United States she loved the flower that very much.	0	0		0																					
2637	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus is motivating her to test for her drivers test. In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. 	1	1		1																					
2640	4	The author put the paragraph in to show the he/she care about the flowers. Flowers only come out during spring and @DATE2 time and thats when you plant study all that grows in a garden. So she can pass the test and be happy with the garden.	1	0		1																					
2641	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus� ends the story with the paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" for a couple of reasons. Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she doesn�t want to be, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope."	2	2		2																					
2643	4	"The author concludes the story by the paragph that says, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again"", because the author wants to convey that. Saeng isn�t going to quit. She is determined to take and pass the test. It also meas that saeng will wait for the right moment to take the test. She will wait till things get better. The situation that she is in improves because it say�s, ""The snow melt, the geese return, and hibiscus is budding.�"	1	1		1																					
2646	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determind story. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2647	4	The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and relizes what it symbolizes to her. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscas herself so that she holds the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this manner.	1	1		1																					
2654	4	I believe that the author ends the story the way she did because it talk�s about both of the subjects. The author is trying to say that when she takes her driving test next spring the hibiscus will give her confidence to pass her driving test. The author	1	1		1																					
2657	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she needs to adapt to the new country. She wants to wait when the hibiscus is budding. The plant budding shows than it is adapting to a new environment just like Saeng. The story shows that Saeng is not used to the new country. she cries when she sees the plants because it reminds her of her old home. The plant also comforts her. when she addapts to the new country, then she will take the test again.	1	2		2																					
2664	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed the driver's test. She is saying when it get's a little warmer outside and the plants grow in maybe she will then take the test again and hopefully pass. I know that she failed the test because it said"" As Saeng walks home after Failing  her driver's test"". I guess that from the snow  being on the ground cause her to  make mistakes when taking the test. In conclusion, that�s why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.."	1	1		1																					
2670	4	The Author @CAPS1 the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. in the spring, when the snow melt and the gees return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She @CAPS1 it with this because she begins the story with Saeng Failing Her Driver license test. and also she was think that the Winter Hibiscus was good luck after it goes away and how she & fimerlary with @CAPS3 which would be the geese she put @CAPS3 together and thats why she said when the geese comes back and the snow melts......That is why she said it.  	1	1		1																					
2672	4	"The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with this sentence when they come back saeng vowed silently to her self in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The Winter Hibiscus symbolizes her fondness of the place she used to live before. Its not a real one I�m mean not the kind we had at-at� she was still too shaky to say the words at home� when the hibiscus buds� she will still be fond of her home but she will have adapted better to her current enviroment. The geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day. When she finds that place she will find herself ready to �take the test"" or do things normally. The author concluded the story with the that sentence to show that Saeng will eventually grow into her new life."	3	2		3																					
2676	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well, but leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action.	1	1		1																					
2678	4	When they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author�s main porpuse of this lines wa to grab the readers attention by making a continuing paragraph that a closing she�s adapting to circumstances. Saeng values the uniqueness of plants, she is also conforted by memories of her homeland	1	1		1																					
2681	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith for a new start. Saeng compares herself to the hibiscus. When the, �hibiscus is @NUM1), she will retake the test. This shows that when the hibiscus restarts its life, so will she. Saeng feels that when the hibiscus is �strong enough to make it through the cold @NUM2), then she is strong enough to pass her driver�s test and live in a new country. Winter and cold represent death, and spring represent a new life or beginning. Saeng thinks to herself, �in the spring� I will take the test @NUM3). This is a new beginning for Saeng, a new hope.	2	3		3																					
2687	4	The author concludes the story with paragraph because it shows Saeng�s sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she dissappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her mom�s gardening, she says, �Here, let me help, mother,� because her mom�s frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, �Saeng didn�t dare look her mother in the eye,� which shows Saeng�s concern for her mother�s reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, �It�s a beautiful plant, I�m glad you got it,� which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saeng�s sympathy to better   herself is shown in the story�s conclusion.	1	1		1																					
2688	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� is about a young girl who cares for gardening over schoolwork. The given conclusion is explaining, when spring comes, and the winter hibiscus is gone, she will pass the school test she failed before. Saeng only cares for the winter Hibiscus right now, for example, the line �I paid over nineteen dollars for it.� Explains she used all her money on this plant rather than any other food. Also the quote �I failed the test� with Saeng crying shows she failed it only because she was worrying about the hibiscus. In conclusion over the spring, when the winter hibiscus is gone, Saeng will focus on school more rather than gardening. Maybe now she will pass her test and go back to her hobby of gardening.	1	1		1																					
2693	4	The author ends the story with �when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2694	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng . After failing the drivers test, saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort  to  help  her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence  she decides to plant it. �The �winter hibiscus� was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. �Then she sees geese flying in the sky which  is kind of a symbol do that day, something to rembember  it by, so the next year.� When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� She will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger.	3	2		3																					
2695	4	I think Saeng need to take the test over because to get her grade up. Saeng be waring about the snow, in the spirng because she is think about the flower getting cover over it. Saeng mother late her help with the pepper and melons, and lat her state dinner.	0	0		0																					
2700	4	The author describes last quote because he wants her dream to achieve. We describes �she realized that many of the things that she had thought the quiet repetition of season, almost familiar to her now. Saeng is from Vietnam, and her family have an @CAPS1 dream. so the author wants that her family adapt their new life in @LOCATION2.	1	1		1																					
2702	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph to give you a sense of hope and determination for the future that dwells within saeng at that time .Throught  the story is seemed as though saeng was giving into despair at the remembrance of her home land ,she wasnt doing so well in her new country and and she had realized it the  most when she had �failed her driving test �.but when she  walked past the flower shop and saw all the plants that used to bloom so freely and beautifly  in her home  land comfind  in those ting pots and fighting to survive it reminded her of  herself here in @LOCATION1. As she began to plant her hibiscus she again compared herself to it and that is why when her plant blooms on the spring so well she will pass that test   	2	3		3																					
2712	4	Well I think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her her attitude better known now she is changing so she is going to put her mind to whatever she has to do and she is going to take the test again with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away.	1	1		1																					
2721	4	The author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an end. Wit  this saeng tell @LOCATION1 that all the snow is gone she will take the test again. If one read   now between the lives it   says more than just this. She really likes the hibiscus and when the hibiscus goes back to life in the spring, she will have new energy to take the test again. From her experience with the hibiscus we can see that this plant really influent her. Because this  plant reminds  her so much of her old home.  Also we can see that everything and everybody should get a second chance. In her case it is the test she wants to take again. Also in the spring she lives a couple month in the @LOCATION1 and she will adjust herself to this new situation. At the moment she is just homesick, even if her home is the @LOCATION1 now. So the hibiscus is good for her, it is some think she can hold onto from her old home� 	2	2		2																					
2725	4	The auther concluded the story with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is willing to change and she wants to do so by the time spring comes. By change Saeng wants to feel comfertable in @LOCATION1 and be able to remember things from where she used to live and not have to break down and cry. Also the author use the geese because they need to leave home earely year and they deal with it so Saeng can deal with it as well.	1	1		1																					
2728	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did, because Saeng is a nature freak. So she really likes nature and she would never ever hurt nature in her life and I guess that they wanted to end off with a nice paragraph. So she needs to take that test again.	0	0		0																					
2733	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One being the fact that she wants to snow sympathay for the hibiscus. Another reason would be showing that Saeng wants to make her mother very proud of her. Meaning that she doesn�t want her mom to think that she is going to give up. This also contributes to the reason that Saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test. Lastly I think that this last paragraph snowed how Saeng wants people to know that even some as small and meaning less as a plant can help her overcome obsticles, and lead her to her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to end the story because of the main fact that how we know that Saeng will not stop believing in herself.    	2	2		2																					
2734	4	"The author of the story, chooses to end the story with that sentence because the story is mainly about how Saeng failed her drivers test, but when she saw the hibiscus, it reminded her of home and made her feel better. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng says, �And that rich, sweet scent � that was familiar too,"" talks about how nice the flowers were and how familiar they were because she reconized the scent. Saeng was already upset about leaving her home in @LOCATION1, then coming to @LOCATION2 and then failing her drivers test, just made it worse, but then she saw the flower and it reminded her of her home, so she felt a little better. So when the author uses that quote, they end the story that way to show that she will have enough courage to try again when the flower blooms."	2	3		3																					
2735	4	The author concludes the story like that to show emphasis.Saeng vowed that so that it will teach her everything lives with hope & adaptation. She means that when everything returns and proves they survive, she will too. She will take that drivers test then. The author also wants to prove that people need to have faith in theirselves. You just need to get used to their surroundings. This is why the author concluded that way.	1	2		2																					
2744	4	The author includes this paragraph into the story because the girl started giving up on herself and felt sad from moving to the United States and also from failing her drivers test, but lastly about the plant that she bought that wasn�t real. Also because he wanted to show that her self esteem had gone up and that she was more confident and wasn�t gonna give up on herself.	1	1		1																					
2745	4	The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the �metaphor� compares Saeng and her test to the perenial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathalon, and my goal was to place first, I place @NUM1 overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathalon came again, and I placed @NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.    	1	2		2																					
2747	4	The author views the hibiscus plant as a new start. For example, when she says �In the spring, whch the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 she failed the first time and got the plant the next time she�ll pass it.	1	1		1																					
2748	4	The author include these paragraph in the story because the it spring, when the snows melt and the geese return. I think the author is talk about winter when it snows and keep snowing until spring hit and then the snow start to melt a way because the sun came out. One reason, is the author is talk about how it change weather when it changes.	0	0		0																					
2765	4	"In the last paragraphy the reason why the author uses ""when they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test. The author uses this because Saeng finally had found comfort. after  moving from a her homeland veelnam to the united States, she felt home sick. For example, she comes across this flower that reminds her of the time she spent in her homeland. She remember he grandmother's smell because of the plant. So when she finally got home to her mother, she showed the flower to her. They both planted the flower, and @CAPS1 got a sense of relief. Thats why she vowed that when winter was oven and spring came she would take that test, because she had a sense of home in her, that gave her uncouragement and strength. it also shows that even when your are in a different area and you are chew, there's always something that can male you remember the unemove and lime spent where you can from"	2	2		2																					
2770	4	It shows not to give up, it ends almost  the same way it began, it shows that people should not stay too attached to the past each are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then she will try again later to pass it. Also the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to which is a good way of writing. One last thing is that it shows that people shouldn�t become too attached to the past because if they look at one thing that reminds them of it they @MONTH1 fall apart, that is why she takes the test, to see if she can look at the familiar flowers without falling apart.   	2	2		2																					
2773	4	"The auther conclude the story by saying she will take the test again in the spring and uptill then vow silently because the spring reminded Saeng of home. In Vietnam there were many beautiful wild flowers. Sarng goes to the flower shop to get a peice of home. It said the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind.� This shows that the plant was not the same because there were also no buds. She had just failed her driving test before this and needed hope, so al waiting till spring when the hibiscus will bloom again that will give Saeng a sense of home which will give her hope to do good on the driving test. "	2	2		2																					
2776	4	The author @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because of the titel and the begening of the story. Or he @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because he wants to. He @MONTH1 have concluded the story like that to show what @MONTH1 happen. But is good conclusion is a good conclusion. 	0	0		0																					
2787	4	The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to set the final mood. The author wanted to show that Saeng will not give up and she will continue to adapt to her new surroundings. It made the end of the story feel warm and it also inspired. The end of the story encourages the reader to not give up as well. The last paragraph sets an example of how the reader can vow to improve as well. The author knew that the last paragraph would stand as an inspiration and mabe help a reader going through something similar to the story.	1	1		1																					
2794	4	The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young childs favoriteplant is the hibiscus. I think that the mother and her childs favorite thing to do together would be gardening. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the read kind of a look of question on their faces. It leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. But in my opinion I think it adds some curiosity to the story.	1	1		1																					
2795	4	"The find lines of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" are meant to provide a glimpse into the near future, to show a change in Saeng's attitude. Up until this point Saeng had been lamenting her old country, and not adjusting well to her new one. The Hibiscus inspires her, and lets her know that the new country has many of the same things as her old country. In this last line, she comes to terms with her present situation. ""When the snows melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" is a way of saying shes going to let a little time pass, and by taking her driver�s test again, she will begin her new life."	2	2		2																					
2796	4	The author concluded the story with saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. When walking home from her test, Saeng saw a familiar flower and chose to make a delar to a flower shop. There, she saw many flowers that reminded her of home. she bought a hibiscus and went home. Her and her mother planted it, after saeng realized the flower could make it through the winter. She looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she realized that she has adapted to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus gave courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue surviving in @LOCATION1.	2	2		2																					
2797	4	The reason I think author concludes this story with this last paragraph is because this is @CAPS1 passion. And that Saeng is very and will do this every year. She really love plants and she will wait to do it again. The last paragraph really showed a lot of dedication. And she really values the spring and the Hibiscus. 	0	0		0																					
2819	4	"The last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus reminded her that her ""home"" was her old life, but misses @CAPS1 in her new life. She gains determination through the reminder of this. She soon realizes that she is home, for things have come familiar to her, such as the V formation of the geese. She loved her old home, but she realized it was time to move on. The last paragraph does not only mean retaking a driving test, it symbolizes the determination to embrace her new home and life.  "	2	3		3																					
2827	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a conclusion that portrays the story. The author talked about the hibiscus in the story as a �comfort in time of distress� a hobby or thing she likes doing with her spear time. In conclusion the author concludes with that paragraph for the reasons stated in the @ORGANIZATION1	0	0		0																					
2836	4	The reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought. Also it symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says, �... this hibiscus is budding ...� (Ho @NUM1). She is also describing that they will start over when spring comes. And that leaves the reader with the last thought about Saeng, and how she has overcome living in the new place. Lastly, it ties up @CAPS1 feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved, �... I will take the test again� (Ho @NUM1), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot. In conclusion, the reason for this quote being the last paragraph is to show that Saeng will continue to try to overcome ??? (WORDS NOT @CAPS2) 	2	2		2																					
2840	4	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms. Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.	2	2		2																					
2844	4	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that �when they come back ... I will take the test again,� (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, �A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept �(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. 	2	2		2																					
2848	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to get the readers wondering. To show that she�s not going to give up on what she wants to do.	1	1		1																					
2849	4	The author Minfong Ho ends the story talking about the test Saeng failed and vowing to take it again because like in the story the test was symbolizing like slightly moving on, just kind of starting her newlife and not living in the old. But Saeng couldnt do that. She bought the flower with all her money because it held memories for her. But I think as the story goes on she kind of realizes she can have both, her old and new life. I think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again. She wants to be able to please her mom, and herself she wants to be able to move on and starts her new life.	2	1		2																					
2852	4	This sentence concludes the passage, to show how when the hibiscus is budding and a new season starts, Saeng will be a new person and will be able to take the test. In this sentence the cold snow, fleeing geese and planted hibiscus can all represent Saeng and what she is going through. They are either cold, ready to leave or restricted just like Saeng feels. But, when a new season starts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is no longer restricted in a pot, Saeng will also grow up and be able to take the test. This sentence is put at the end to show how much Saeng can now grow because she has the hibiscus, which is growing with her.	2	3		3																					
2853	4	The author ends the story with the sentence provided because , she as she was saying that when  you and winter are over there be the time again to get there gardening back to the test with the plant she had planted. 	0	0		0																					
2858	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts.	1	1		1																					
2859	4	When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus. She felt it could with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased	0	0		0																					
2862	4	NO IMAGE	1	1		1																					
2864	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home land she will eventualy pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misss the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.	2	2		2																					
2866	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorperating the geese, hibiscus and her drivers test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the drivers test again through memories of Vietnam lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not overconsistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story."	1	1		1																					
2870	4	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take thattest again"". To show that Saeng is going to take the test again and is not going to give up. This is shown by saying, ""then I will take that test again"". This shows that she has not given up and wants to try again.  "	1	1		1																					
2873	4	The author ends the story by saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story. When she gets home her mother �noticed the tear staie on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes.� Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story but by the end she felt happy and optimistic. 	2	1		2																					
2877	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. Durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it it�s winter and the hibiscus hasen�t bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And thats why I think the author ended with that paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2882	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because know matter what she said or did she had to git the flower because it remids her of where she used to live and how It was there so she stared to cry and the test was not to buy the flower and not to cry and that in th spring she is going to grow her own flower. That is what I think the test is about.	1	1		1																					
2887	4	The author concludes the story with this  paragraph  because,Saeng  is determined  to  pass the test. She knows when its spring and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test I think she wants to retake the test because  the  hibiscus makes her think about her homeland. It makes her feel more confident. She thinks she can pass it next time. The hibiscus  makes  her  happy and overwhelmed. She wants to retake the test. She�s sure she will do better next time.	1	2		2																					
2888	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. It�s just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. That�s the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.  	2	2		2																					
2889	4	"Guess that she is saying that when winter is gone she will prepared for that winter test again. I guess this because they were not prepared for the winter to come as they were planting. As in the reading she says, ""As if oblivious to the cold, he mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. Thats the reason why I believed that they were not prepared for the winter."	1	1		1																					
2892	4	"The author concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to emphasize a new life and new chances for the main character. The future setting of the paragraph, spring, symbolizes rebirth & another start from the cold, hard winter. The author takes this to heart including, more events which enhance this symbolized meaning. the author has uses structured choice to carry her toughts. Recreate, when to convey the theme of rebirth, the author uses words like ""the gesse return"" and ""take the test again"" which add to the importance at the home. Also, the literal action of the ""hibiscus is budding"" @CAPS1 rebirth. In winter the plant is dormant & less colorful, but in the spring the plant shows rebirth through about color in its buds. The author finally conveys the theme of rebirth by ending with this paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2897	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.	1	1		1																					
2907	4	The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life. The test might be one to see if she can understand her self. There changes in the weather all the time there changes in the spring fall she other that you just got to get over.	1	1		1																					
2912	4	the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first their is always a second time just like the @CAPS1 I dies in the winter and it come back alive in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2915	4	The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to @LOCATION1, the geese show her that she is, even now adapting to her new homeland when she geese seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was pretty but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she came to @LOCATION1, is adopted to the mre resilient and withstand the snow which symbolizes her problems adapting to @LOCATION1. For saeng, the hibiscus budding again represents her becoming stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to go take the test again when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to connect the Hibiscus budding with Saeng overcoming her obstacles. 	3	3		3																					
2916	4	The author chose to conclude the story like that because she’s saying that it isn’t over and she’s going to take the test again. In the story Saeng says “I- I failed the test” so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.	1	1		1																					
2917	4	I think what the author is trying to say is that she will take her driving test again in the spring when the flowers are out because it will make her feel more relaxed. The flowers put the author in a relaxed state of mind where she can focus.	1	1		1																					
2923	4	I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up	0	0		0																					
2926	4	I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, �it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here� @CAPS1 it�s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again.	2	2		2																					
2932	4	When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year. She means trying to plant the plants all over again. When Saeng says �Here, let me help, mother. Right then you know that Saeng does want to help with the plants after all.	0	0		0																					
2938	4	I�ll think the author tried two say wean it coming two snow melt like @MONTH1 they she will be come back. Author will because in the spring sometime to written a new book.	0	0		0																					
2939	4	The author of�Winter Hibiscus �uses this paragraph to conclude her story because it is a symbol of saeng�s future .Winter Hibiscus is a symbol of saeng for many reasons.  For one, both saeng and the plant are from Vietnam and both struggle to survive and thrive in the new world of the @ORGANIZATION1.  Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, so shall she by retaking her driver�s test.  This symbol of future is extremely important to the story live and this is why ming fon Ho, the author of Winter Hibiscus, chose to end with this vital symbol.   	2	2		2																					
2943	4	In the text, when the mother said �It�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matter� This sentences shows that Saeng is just like the flowers. They�re strong to live through the winter, that shows they are very pretty and strong in the spring. This amphasis that Saeng will be strong and more confident in the spring. That�s why the author put it in at the end. It�s also reflected to the flower, how they�re pretty and strong in spring	2	1		2																					
2946	4	I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn�t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year. Ane example of this is an exact quote �in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again�. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that.	1	1		1																					
2947	4	The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her drivers test for the first time when the hibiscus starts to bud it will represent a change in her life. Also, Saeng use to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam so when the flower buds it could show that she has a new home. 	1	1		1																					
2955	4	She compares the paragraph to the story to compare it to school. The test is makeing new friends and doing good on the test and classes. In the paragraph it said �Then I will take that test again.� That is the reason she is comparing that paragraph to school.  	0	0		0																					
2956	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the Saeng's determination to over come the obstacles of her past experience. For example, the story starts out with Saeng taking a �test�,  while reliving her memories in the greenhouse, she started to breakdown. �A wave of loss so deep and story it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" She then buys the plant and takes it home to her mother,telling her that she 'failed'. The mother then becomes understanding and helps Saeng's vow retake the 'test', the narrator emphasizes Saeng�s determination to overcome the troubles of her past and go on with the future."	2	2		2																					
2957	4	Because her school work was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a green garden. And it is obvious she failed the test so when spring starts to show she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom and she can do more study to pass the test and not have to take it again. I get the feeling though she is also looking forward to the spring time coming back now an day so she can enjoy the flowers and the presents of growing and studying.	1	1		1																					
2962	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.In the story, glimpses of @CAPS1 home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. �She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.� Here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saeng�s despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, �then I will take that test again.�you can feel her hope. Also, the author want`s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says,�the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,� and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security.	3	3		3																					
2963	4	The author concludes the story of the paragraph because, the author would like to finish the last sentence of the story. Also at the last of the paragraph is when she is visualizing and putting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are appreciated to the plant. The author wanted more evidence to the story. For example, when it said, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese ruturn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It includes the winter time for the plant. Also, the @DATE2 and spring the plant comes back, which the character saeng will get it back, and visit it.	1	0		1

2966	4	I believe that the author left this as the last thing the reader will read, so it will be a message. In the story this girl has now moved to this totally new environment and new culture. The only thing she knew of was a flower that grew wild where she lived. This little vow to herself was a message to not give up. Keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn. So this girl didnt just give up. Her plant was like a representation of a new beginning. When her plant starts over then so will I. Also it can be a representation of her life itself. I say a new begging because in the text, it says,	2	2		2																					
2969	4	In the story the Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho it explains the obstacles Saeng went through coming to a different country. In this story Saeng had just failed her driving test as she was reminded of her home through some tropical flowers. Moreover the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.� This part of the story is very important because it examines her growth and hope for change, just us the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a buetiful blossed flower. Furthermore it explains to the each that she will not give up and that she will change to the environment just as th plant lives has and the geese come back to the changed environment. That part of the story is very important for the reader, @CAPS1 it concludes Saeng thoughts and hopes for the future wile adapting to her new enviorment.     	3	3		3																					
2970	4	The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there waste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there watste.

2972	4	The reason why the said she will wait til spring to take the test again, is to see if she�s still like the bitter melon over the Big-mac.	0	0		0																					
2977	4	The paragraph shows that Saeng has a lot of feelings for her plants. She enjoys plants and she loves taking the time to spend with the plants. She means in that last paragraph that she cant wait for winter to leave so her plants will be budding and that she can enjoy her plants.	0	0		0																					
2978	4	"The author concludes the story with this parapraph because it ties it all together. I think that the author uses. it also to say that in the spring she will pass the test. I really like the part when she says ""�in the spring, when the snows melt�."" I like that because it explains what she wants and how she puts her mind to it."	1	1		1																					
2979	4	The author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over. She uses geese as a symbol for spring, when she would start preparing for this �test� once again. The hibiscus budding in this paragraph shows hope, because it is once again, a start of a cycle as well as an object of reminiscence in the story. In conclusion, this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and devices in order to convey hope, good memories, and fresh start.	2	2		2																					
2980	4	The would grow some flowers and water the geese come back to her pond.	0	0		0																					
2981	4	THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE REASON BEING THAT THE AUTHOR WANTED TO REALLY SHOW THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER. ANOTHER REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME. FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THAT PARAGRAPH IT SAYS �THEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.�, ITS RELATING THAT SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER. WHICH THEN RELATES IT TO THE THEME OF ADJUSTING AND KEEP TRYING TILL YOU ADJUST. THAT LAST PARAGRAPH WAS QUITE VITAL TO THE THEME AND MEANING OF THE STORY.	2	1		2																					
2982	4	I believe the author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus�, written by Minfong Ho, with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, because she is trying to show how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test Saeng finds the Hibiscus, the memories of her home land and her grandmother consume her. She buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden. After she is done planting, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese fly overhead. Using her memory of her old home and her family, applied to her new surroundings, Saeng vows to re-take the test, to try again. The author ends the story �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up.	2	3		3																					
3000	4	The author concludes the story with �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She does this to show now Saeng is adapting and making decisions in her new country just like she did in her homeland. In Vietnam Saeng used to brush her grandmothers hair and help put it into a bun and put a hibiscus in it. That was one of her traditions with it. Also when she used to get water from the well a hibiscus would sometimes come up with the bucket. Both these thus the hibiscus was seen as a comfort object, now as she is in the states, she is trying to put it to good use, while also taking into account what repeats in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and plants start to grow in the spring. By her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom. The plant being potted in her garden and Saeng moving her both signify change, but a rembrance of old traditions, and a space for new.     	3	3		3																					
3003	4	She ends it with this sentence because its a sign of new life. Just as the winter that killed the plants ending life, the spring will come and start anew. This is how Saeng feels because she left her country and all the memories left behind she feels out of place like the winter hibiscus but as the spring comes she�ll feel as anew person ready and able to take challenges as she said here �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now� she describes that with a new season comes new changes and upon those changes she will go on to take the drivers test again.	3	2		3																					
3005	4	The author uses symbolism to convey a different message. Saeng said in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, and then I will take that test again. The author uses the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng gets older like the hibiscus, that then she will be ready to take that test again. The author uses symbolize to convey more of the story.	2	2		2																					
3007	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wants to start planting again. I know this because Saeng life revolves around planting and @CAPS1. Saeng and her mother get there food from what they plant. So all @DATE1 they spend most there time in the garden. growing crops to sell and save. They save for winter and sell to get there equiement to continue whot they do. The part she talking about in the paragraph that say �when they come back� talking about the geese. She loves the geese flying over her head and landing in the yard when she outside on a beauttiful day @CAPS1. when The snow melts she wants to  get back at in the soil on her hands and knee to start planting again. Once the hibiscus start budding everything else starts growing. Saeng live revolves around @DATE1 planting. The author put this paragraph in the story because this is what saeng wants to do more than anything.	1	0		1																					
3012	4	"Thes Author, In the story �Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph to show how often Saeng gets tested by her memories. Saeng has ""tested"" erlier in the story when she was in a flourist. Memories come rushing back to her like a flood and she tried to feel the same as she did long ago whe her grandmother was there, and she realized that things in her memories were long gone, so she wept. Saeng reported to her mother that she had failed the test, and bought the plant to try and comfort herself. Her mother was very understanding and accepted it. Saeng planted the habiscus and at the end says that ""In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". Saeng knew seeing the flower again will make her cry, will make her memories come back, she will be re tested."	2	1		2																					
3013	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho a girl named Saeng failed her drivers test that day then vowed that she would retake from the spring. She ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life. This archetype being the changing from harsh cold winter to nice warm spring time shows that the trouble her mother and Saeng would get better. As hard trouble winter left than their is calmwarm new beginning spring. Saeng knows this and knows that she is going to pass."	2	1		2																					
3014	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for various reasons. For example, the whole passage is talking about how the hibiscus flower provides Saeng with the ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort her in a time of disappointment. This ending paragraph shows that �in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding,� and everything is beautiful again then Saeng will take her test again. She knows that with the help of the hibiscus plant, that she will pass the test. It shows that her hope and trust to pass the test comes from the hibiscus flower. The plant with �waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers� will provide her the strength, determination, courage, and will power to pass the test in the spring.	2	2		2																					
3019	4	The author Minfong Ho concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus�, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, �.. in the spring...� it�s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It�s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  	3	3		3																					
3023	4	Clearly From rending the story Winter @CAPS1, the author @CAPS2 this phrase �when they come Back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test Again� in the story because the passage relates to the title of the story Winter @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
3024	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didn�t do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it. The author is showing Saeng�s determination to pass the test and do better next time.	1	1		1																					
3030	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph of ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because this paragraph can show that the hibiscus is the reason why Saeng wants to try the test again. If the hibiscus is budding after the snow melt and the geese return, then she can do as the hibiscus be strong and won�t give up on her test."	1	1		1																					
3034	4	The reason why the author concludes this type of senerario is simply because the author has a pain to cross and or a situation in this particular author you know son but if you get it straight you�ll open your eyes and see that its your time to shine you might as well grab it before you loose your chance you only get one day to prove you are worthy to the people.	0	0		0																					
3039	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concludes the story because as if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel.	0	0		0																					
3041	4	What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that where it is a seasson for those plants she will take the test again. The test to begin to like like the plot. Like features and characters about. Also the history about these plants. 	0	0		0																					
3042	4	She is demanding to not take the test again if the winter hibiscus don't come back she was upset that she had failed the test. She spent most of her day looking at the hibiscus but she was still upset that they were�nt the real ones back at home. Her mother said they are strong enough to make it through the winter. when they come back  Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again	1	1		1																					
3046	4	"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home, and the old, together in harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which relates to the determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently through the winter. A lot of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages hidden within that final sentence It implies that, though the past @MONTH1 be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can be conquered."	1	2		2																					
3047	4	The authar concludes the story with the paragraph they because it shows saeng determination and her overcoming her obstacles of being new in a country. With all of the doubts saeng had right after her test it is very big of her to come to this conclusion of retaking the test, �Here, let me help you mother,she offered� (HO). With her mom comforting her and telling her it is @CAPS1, gives saeng the boost she needs to help her mother and think to herself that she can�t let just one thing hold her back in life. the support saeng has she will definetly pass the test the next time.	2	1		2																					
3055	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because its show signs of hope and that knowing that spring will come again. For the family and that everything will be ok. For them also. The girl will makes friends also when spring comes.	1	1		1																					
3058	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is thinking what it will be like when all of this happens. Saeng said; �when they come back, she vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.	0	0		0																					
3063	4	"Authors sometimes conclude a story with a certain paragraph describing an action that will take place in the future. In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author concludes the paragraph by saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� One reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to help show that things will change come spring. For example in the story the girl saids �I-I failed the test.� By her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change. She can get better, so that this time she will pass. Also, �The ""winter hibiscus� was in the ground now, and @CAPS1 tamped down the soil around it.� This quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now, but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed. In conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future."	2	2		2																					
3065	4	The reason why the aurthor wanted to put that last paragraph down because they want to keep the reader interested in the story. Another reason why she/@CAPS1 put that in the story; @CAPS2/@CAPS3 it is letting the reader know that plant will never give up.	0	0		0																					
3067	4	The author concludes the story with the main character vowing to take the drivers test again to symbolize moving forward. � Saeng felt a shock of recognition so inffuse, it was almost visceral.� A  pone stumbling to a florist shop the main character sees a flower that reminded her of her home land, Vietnam. �Here, let me help, mother.� In relieving  her mother in the task of planting the seed that she had bought she began to mature. After reflecting on the memories of her past and coming to peace with there   there   was nothing left stoping   her from moving  forward. �when   they come back  I will take that test again.� As she sees   geese migrating south for the winter in a v formation she sets a goal for herself and uses that goal as a tool to help herself grow and move foward in the new country she�s in. The main character vowing in �Winter Hibiscus� symbolizes moving   foward.	3	2		3																					
3072	4	"The author concluded the last paragraph in the story ""winter Hibiscus"" to say that the narrator ""Saeng"" isn�t given up on her driving test"	1	1		1																					
3076	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to explain to us that this plant is going to bring good luck. The snow will melt, the geese will return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. Its starting over fresh, a new beggining. Since she had failed her driving test she will start over in the spring. In conclusion this is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3082	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. So when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng still doesn�t like the change and would like to go back to her old home	2	2		2																					
3098	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows her determination. Saeng is having problems with both adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life. we see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, �she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� we see that Saeng bought the flower because it made her feel securit. It was something from home that felt familiar to her and I believe thats why she included the story with this paragraph because next year she will have a sense of security and familiarity when taking the test because the experience she had will be making again.	2	2		2																					
3102	4	"At the end of the short story, �winter Hibiscus�, the writer Minfong Ho includes somewhat inspirational concluding sentence �when they come back  in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.� I think this sentence was added in order to create a sense of hope for the future, which contrasts so greatly with the depressing nature of the story, creating a happy ending. Throughout the essay, Saeng is depressed she had to leave her homeland so hurriedly losing her childhood and beloved grandmother, �A blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone.� as Saeng narrates in deeper detail. Also contributing to the feelings of sorrow in the story is how much saeng cries remembering her tragic past. Im both the greenhouse, recalling the events of her grandmother such as when she says, �Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it."" and in the garden, when she talks to her mother and plants the flower. After all this sorrow, by putting in a hopeful ending, the writer has successfully allowed a sense of hope for the future.    "	3	3		3																					
3105	4	The author of this story story created the last paragraph so that it finishes the story with a great ending. The fact of never giving up and try again again and again. The author said, �I will take the test again.� In the story Saeng said, �I failed the test� but now that she isn't giving up. This last paragraph makes a lot of senses and is needed to make this story complete. So just as others don't give up in @LOCATION1, Saeng is doing the same and is retaking the test.	1	1		1																					
3107	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending but I have no idea on what that means so the author should explain what it means not me.	0	0		0																					
3116	4	When the author concluded the narrative by when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles, finding comfort in a time of disappointment, and her connection to her past experiences. First, it demostrates the ability to overcome obstacles because they are obstacles in everyone lives, and you don�t have a choice to conquer them because there are unlimited. So the hibiscus flower represents the obsticles and the weather represent time because weather is stopping the flower to bloom and bloosom. Secondly, it also represent the finding of comfot in a time of disappointment because when you have going through an obstacle you would find disappointment there lingering. However she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back and she have the awareness of the obstacles coming back. Finally, it asserts her connection to her past experience because she is trapped in a world that she is not familiar with, which would make her an alien. She capture the sense of being out of place, because you can relate that the hiatcus flower would be her because she is eccentric and different from the rest of the people in her environment she is trying to adapt her way of living and trying to survive in the world, like when she was in her own country.	2	2		2																					
3120	4	The authors purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return she will have to again take care of the plant. Thats clear because taking a test is a big responsibility therefore taking care of that plant is also a huge task refering  to taking the test again. this is what the purpose of the concluding sentence meant.	1	1		1																					
3125	4	The story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about her �home� where she no longer lived. After she had broke down, bought the plant, and learned to actually accept the fact that she no longer lived in Vietnam and accepting that she had failed her driving test, she realized that she just has to learn to like it. She also learned that her time will come and she will one day be driving. The reason why the auethor concluded the story with this paragraph is because this is the conclusion of the story. this is where one realizes the important things.	1	2		2																					
3130	4	"In �Winter Hibiscus,� Minfong Ho ends the story how she does to show a sign of hope. Saeng is going to start over when the world starts over. Spring is the time when animals come out of their winter holes, when trees blossom, and when the snow melts. It is a time of renewed. Saeng �Vowed silently to herself to try again in the spring time.Saeng parchases the hibiscus in remembrance of her homeland, but also to know when it is ready to come back out of the base to try again. The hibiscus does these actions by coming out of its buds and blooming. Ho ends her story in hope of a new beginning. Saeng vows, �Then I will take that test again.� In the word choice of �That test again� depicts her new attitude. She wants to try again, her test.     """	2	2		2																					
3138	4	The author concludes the story with that because she is determined to succeed in @LOCATION1. She misses her homeland and everything there: gardens, grandparents etc. For example , she walked into the flowershop she smells the flowers like she used to back home. She then smelled a flower that reminded her of her grandmothers �long gray hair, freshly washed �� But by saying that last sentence she said that when the hibiscus budded next winter she will take the test that she failed again.	1	2		2																					
3153	4	I think she concluded with this statement because she doesn�t know if she will pass but she isn�t giving up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she feels bad and the plant helped to cheer her up so when she sees the plant next year she wants to take the test.The plant is like a sign of good luck. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it leaves you with the idea not to give up when times are hard keep trying.  	1	1		1																					
3158	4	The author concludes this paragraph to the story because, seasons change, plant don�t most likely grow during winter time. So you learn a lesson and take it as it is and a wait until the next time you learn basically the same lesson, when the right time comes.	1	1		1																					
3159	4	I think that in the story �Winter Hibiscus� was a good story and also the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was like to work hard and that is why it mentions at the way end �I will take the test again� so you don�t fall and stay down you work hard and get back up and try again.	1	1		1																					
3161	4	The story is somewhat sad. The girl misses her homeland. She is also sad because she failed her driving test. The author I think ends the story with the girl saying she will take the test again, to show that even though she is sad about her country and failing she is not going to give up. Failing a test especially a driving test stinks. Your very excited to get it but then you don�t. So the author is trying to show that despite the girls sadness she will not give up. The girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes. Also the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note you usually don�t want to leave a story sad with no solution. So she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons why the author ended the way she did but above are the more obvious.	2	2		2																					
3164	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driver�s test. To Saeng her failing the driver�s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng�s promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didn�t give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.     	3	2		3																					
3167	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the �test� again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng�s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she �failed the test�, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow.	3	3		3																					
3170	4	The author would conclude the essay like he did because it sounded good to help he all the shangling ideas together. For example one person said, �she silently vowed to herself in the spring after the snow melts she would retake that test.   	0	0		0																					
3172	4	The authoR ends the STORY this way because their trying To show that Saeng will be dedicated To the hibiscus gardening and once she proves herself she will have passed the test. It also shows that she wants her heritage to be a major part of her life by growing their nations flower 	0	0		0																					
3173	4	"The author ends the story with this quote, because it shows how determined Saeng is to passing her driving test. For example, in the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", Saeng after she fails her driving test says something to forget about fating, and she said, �Let�s plant, right now�, she said this because she was trying to forget about her failing, and focus in something positive, In conclusion, this is why the author ends with this quote, and an example of how determined and focus Saeng is to passing her driving test.    "	1	1		1																					
3177	4	The author concludes the last paragraph to show that after a time period you can come back and try something again. Or maybe when weather change this can be different for Saeng. Maybe she is relating herself to the plant as to when it come to spring  the flower will be stronger, and she feel that she will pass the test second time around when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. And it also shows how she appriate the nature because if not, why would she wait until spring and when the snow is melting. The conclusion of the story is that she do like nature, because she talk about the hibiscus.	1	2		2																					
3182	4	"The author of this story was smart to end it by saying she will take the test again in the spring, when every thing bloms. This girl just  failed her driving test she dose not want to take it right away. The blomming of the hibiscus symbolizes her old life at her old home and it is also symbolizing a new start when it bloms. This will give her the confodence to pass her driving test and make he excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return�. This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and fells contible, at home you are contible. The author ended this story of this girl, Saeng, with hope and drive to do what she wants to do. That is why it was smart to end the story like they  ended it.  "	2	3		3																					
3184	4	"In the Story the @CAPS1 concluds the story with the sentance ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think he ends it this way because she has accepted that she failed or lost but is willing to try again to accomplish her goal and ""take that test again"". Also she is making a promise, or a vow to her self and to not give up on her goal."	2	1		2																					
3192	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because earlier in the story, saeng was talking about how she failed the test, in which she wanted to retake. So, saeng declared that next year, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding , she shall take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3204	4	The author puts this paragraph last because it shows that saeng is looking to a new lease almost on life. She now has something to take her through the year that is ahead of her she now wait till it is winter once again to see the hibiscus flower bloom once again and as wel as many more to come	1	1		1																					
3211	4	The author comes back to that paragraph because in the story Saeng is so sorry she did not @CAPS1 the test. Now saeng wants to make up for it, She vowed to herself she will @CAPS1 that test. For example, when I say to herself I am going to get sumthin done I do what it takes to get it done and I don't give up when things get rough, @CAPS3, This last sentense is what the main idea of the story is, To make up that test and @CAPS1 it, To get done what needs to be done	1	1		1																					
3212	4	The reason why this author includes this story with this paragraph is because it is still talking about saeng and that is more like her and that she has a mind like a butterflye that was trapped a burst out with this open the Saeng and her mom had but a tennage girl me and saeng we kind relate to the same thing.	0	0		0																					
3214	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he is telling the reader that after the snow leaves the author will begin to plant more plants. The test is to make sure his plants don�t die during next @DATE1.	0	0		0																					
3219	4	The reason why is so you get the feeling that Saeng feels about gardening. She is praying for spring to come so she can do it over again. She like to watch plants grow and become something that you can eat. That is way the Author concluded the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3222	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she can go through these obstacles even though she moved from her home land. Also it shows that she has more confidence thats why the author concluded her story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3225	4	The auther concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. first, The test is important to Saeng so that she can prove to herself that she is able to pass it. Ending with this paragraph also gives the reader some suspense as to wheather Saeng will pass or even go to take the test again. Lastly, this paragraph shows Saeng�s personality traits. It shows that she is persistent, determined, and strong willed.	2	1		2																					
3229	4	The author concludes the story with this final paragraph to show how sentimental and important the plant is to Saeng. She will take that test again when the winter is over because it's too cold for nice hibiscus to survive. You need a winter hibiscus. �Not like the kind we had before �(@NUM1). This shows how important it is that she finds a hibiscus like the ones she had at home. She shows dissapointment in herself until that last paragraph when she shows courage and strong will.	1	1		1																					
3235	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is saying that when the flowers come back in the spring, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding after winter, she will garden them again.	0	0		0																					
3237	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again maybe you will do alot better.     	1	1		1																					
3239	4	The author concludes the story in winter hibiscus, Kind of funny/ weird like . The concluding sentence is �when they come back saeng vowed silently to herself in the  spring, when  the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I know one thing the part of the title is in the concluding sentence, so it is basically it is concluding the whole  story, plus the characters	0	0		0																					
3245	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author�s purpose in concluding the story with �When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,� was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. �Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.� This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, �How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. �This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months�. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal.	3	3		3																					
3246	4	"The author concluded the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can survive through hard times and adapt to changes, and survive she can also. Saeng icoms that even though she has moved to the United States and it is different she is strong enough to survive. Failing her drivers test dosent mean that she is incapable of anything, but trying again with a fresh start like the hibiscus."	2	2		2																					
3248	4	The last paragraph was added in order to represent the determinedness and adapting to new things in Saeng and her family. In the beginning, Saeng held bitterness at failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, she will be a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her being determined to deal with it is that she does make friends, and, though the food she offered was rejected she didn�t give in. The moment of breakdown was as she got the flower. After she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change.	2	1		2																					
3255	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� includes �when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again because it shows that she can adapt to change and still can think about her old country too. An example of how she can keep her old country alive in her life is� But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much perferred it to a Big Mac.� This shows that she can still eat the foods she ate back at her old home and try new things at her new home. In conclusion the excerpt shows that the author can put both cultures together and be happy.	2	2		2																					
3256	4	There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, she will have many more reasons to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year. She had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing @CAPS1 new beginning that she will have to go through the next year. 	2	3		3																					
3259	4	The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a little. For example when Saeng said that she ment when the plants came back. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on two, rather than staping on talking about the v or geese to get the reader off topic. Last she also ment when the geese came back.	0	0		0																					
3260	4	I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see�s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack.	1	1		1																					
3261	4	I think the author ended the story with that phrase to show that she wont give up; no matter how hard it is she keeps trying. The girl says in the story �I failed the test,� and then at the end of the story says I will take that test again so she is not willing to fail forever. I also think the author ended the story with that paragraph to make you wonder if she will ever pass the test.	1	1		1																					
3262	4	I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasn�t ready for before but now whenever the geese return and the hibiscus return the she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasn�t mentally prepared. So inconclusion I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return the she will take the test and maybe she wasn�t physicaly and mentally prepared for it. 	1	1		1																					
3271	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph that she did because it was the end and the start of a new beggining. The author uses the sensens in her story. The winter is the current season and spring is on its way. Although Saeng failed her test in the winter when most things die, she is looking forward to spring to start again on her test. The geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life. Saeng will also have new life in her test to pass it this time and drive. The spring season will come and new life will be provided to all.   	2	2		2																					
3277	4	The author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. All throughout the story there was depresing nogistalistic tone that made the reader yearn for the past. The author wanted to put on emphisis on being strong even though you @MONTH1 not enjoy where you are at. Also the author wanted to show the strength of the main of the main character Saeng. Even though she has just failed a test in a new, strange world she still wishes to continue pushing foward. This adds more demension the the character and makes her less static and more dynamic. This is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward.	2	2		2																					
3278	4	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to get some roots in the new soil she is on. When she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time.	2	1		2																					
3279	4	I believe the author concludes the that passage in the story to show patintions. Saeng was to wait for spring maybe it will feel like her home town again. She likes the spring better than the winter. She likes the birds the geese return in sping. They go away in winter. That way I believe the author concludes that passage.	1	1		1																					
3281	4	"The author concludes as the story with the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself., in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" mean that she will take the test and hoped she pass so she could make her mother happy and support her. She chosee spring because spling is the rebirth of nature and Saeng would like to retake the test with a clear and clean mind. I think that the reason why the author choose to put the paragraph in the end of the story. "	1	1		1																					
3282	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn�t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, �I-I failed the test.� When she says �the test� she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, �When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces.	2	2		2																					
3292	4	"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says �When they come back� she is talking about the flowers. When the come back alive. �In the spring� shows when the flower will come back. �When the snows melt and the geese return� she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring). �And this Hibiscus is budding� She is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring. � Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!"	1	2		2																					
3296	4	Saeng is @CAPS1 that it Will be a longtime before she will worn about school work again. thats Why the author concluds the story with their paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3300	4	Well, I think the author concludes the story with that sentence because maybe Saeng likes the spring and can concentrate better with her favorite flower that she thinks relates to her life.	1	1		1																					
3302	4	The author concludes the story with they paragraph that they did because it's about the same thing that they opened the story with.  To introduce the story, the author tells about Saeng failing her drivers test, and then seeing a familiar plant that she wants to buy. The middle of the story is about how she is having a hard time adapting to her new home. So to conclude the story, the author puts that Saeng will take her drivers test again, once the flowers starts budding, and the geese come out. The flower and the geese remind her of home, so this tells you that thinking of her home, and the objects that make her feel at home, comfort her, and help her overcome obstacles.	2	2		2																					
3309	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wanted to show that Saeng doesn�t give up and that nature gives @CAPS1 strength. The conclusion shows that Saeng doesn�t give up by saying that she is going to take the test again, even though she failed it earlier that day. Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by saying that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return, when hibiscus buds and when the snow melts in spring nature gives her strength because it reminds her of where they used to live and her grandmother. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature gives her strength and confidence.	2	2		2																					
3310	4	The character, Saeng, experiences both internal and external conflicts. Saeng had failed her driver�s test and stilled missed Vietnam. The ending of the story was an excellent choice of conclusion for the story. The flock of @CAPS1 geese represented her changes. She used to foot awkward and out of places. Many things were new to her. Saeng realized that life isn't so bad for her. The planting of the �winter hibiscus� represented her change as well. It showed how she will start new and continue happily. Saeng will �plant a new seed.� The ending was well chosen for the story because it foreshadows Saeng�s future. The story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect.	2	2		2																					
3314	4	"The author chose that paragraph to put at the end because that is when everything will be perfect to redo her mistake. Saeng said crying ""I-I failed the test!"" @CAPS1 means she failed at what she thought she was good at. �Here let me help mother"" getting up and taking the shovel away from her mother. Saeng is trying to get better at gardening so when she does redo her mistake she will do better. As the reader can see Saeng wants to pass the test, so she can believe sh is a great gardener like her mother."	0	0		0																					
3316	4	Cause every thing that is in this paragraph is in the story somewere. So it really intwines to gether. She learns to adapt to her new home land as dose the plant.  	1	1		1																					
3320	4	I  think  when  she  take  the  test  over  it  is going  to  be  in  the  spring  and  She  is  going  to  try  and  pass  it .  But  she  did  not  want  to  cry  in  front of her  mother  . I  think  she  is   going  to  make  it  up  to  her  and  pass  the  test.	1	1		1																					
3321	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to show the readers she was knocked down but she is going to get back up again and take the test again. This is also a very good way to end the story because it shows she is very determined to pass that test and won�t give up and will do anything to pass it.	1	1		1																					
3323	4	"I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perserverance. Saeng states, �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, �when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the season's bring things back, she will come back. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should perservere because things just take time."	2	1		2																					
3325	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� for several reasons, @CAPS1, Saeng decides that she is determined to pass her driving test just like the hibiscus. Saeng�s mother says that it is �strong enough to make it through,� and Saeng decides to be strong like the hibiscus and make it through and pass the test. Next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to @LOCATION1 because the geese �sound familiar.� As much as she misses her old home, she is adapting. Finally, one can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, that as much as she misses her old home, she�s starting to get used to her new country and she recognizes that she ispart of it. She knows that letting her past get in the way of her will not help her pass the test and, like the plant and the geese, she will return again.	3	3		3																					
3333	4	In the story , �Winter Hibiscus�, Saeng is new to @LOCATION1. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she�ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test.	3	3		3																					
3334	4	They ended it because the girl is not going to give up. She is going to keep trying at this test and wont stop at it eaither. And she will be alittle brighter. She will also pass this test. And this way she wont disappoint her mother. And she will be able to get this test of of her sholders.	1	1		1																					
3335	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on.	3	3		3																					
3337	4	"In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author conclude the story with that special paragraph in order to mutul Saeng�s game for wanting to be home but also to show that she is learning to overcome obstacles. Saeng wishes that she way in her homeland, and keeps up reffiring to it because she wants it back. �I mean, it�s not like the one we had at-at-,� Saeng continues to stumble because she doesn�t wish to mention home because it brought her to tears. In addition, were she mentions the �test�, it makes to her buyin a fake test.�It�s - it�s not a real one�. She refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is. The test reffs to both the plant and the driver�s test. Saeng also ends with this vow because the flower represent hope to her, ""... and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test�. The emotions test of both of the situations she is is will allow her to be stronger. This vow at the end of the story shows her willing up to be strong and come through in the end."	3	3		3																					
3342	4	The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng�s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn�t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did.	1	2		2																					
3345	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is going to adapt to the conditions of her new life. The hibiscus is a plant that thrives in warm, tropical climates. However it does not survive in the cold; only the winter hibiscus, which can survive in both climates (warm and cold) can. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. She lived in Vietnam and loved it with all the pretty flowers and being with her grandmother. However now that she is living in the United States, she is finding it hard to adapt. Now that she has this hibiscus flower, which adapts to the cold weather magnificently, she can adjust to her new life in the United States. When she sees the geese come back for another spring and summers, she will take the driving test because they are giving her area another chance of being their home for the season. This is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	3	3		3																					
3351	4	The flowers on this bush are very comforting to Saeng. In the story she explains that they remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of plant and spring represent new life. Saeng thinks that spring could also have a new beginning for her. That in spring, she will do better and pass the test. But, if she falls again, the flowers will have bloomed to comfort her.	2	2		2																					
3355	4	Minfong Ho, the author of �  Winter Hibiscus � concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself that she will retake and pass her drivers test in the spring when the geese fly back and plant rebuds. The author concluded the story with this paragraph   to signify Saeng�s   willingness to start over. After failing a test, Saeng visits a green house and misses her old home, Vietnam. She buys a hibiscus and plants it when she comes home after noting the geese flying south for the   Winter. The plant signifies her memories. When she first sees it, it�s blossomed. In the spring it will rebud  and form another blossom while growing bigger. This parallels Saeng   getting over her sadness and homesickness and rebuilding   better memories while growing stronger. When she gets  the chance. The birds flying  overhead are headed south for the winter for shelter from the cold.

3361	4	The author concludes the story with the sentence saying �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again� because the hibiscus is not as a good luck charm, when it�s not there things aint right but when it comes back thing�s then out for the better. Also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed. Last one not story this let�s the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well	2	1		2																					
3366	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that everything and everyone can make it through a tough time. This paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers. The text say, �when they come back... I will take that test again�. This quote shows that Saeng can see herself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She knows that her �winter� is her test and that when she is ready, she�ll be able to take the test again and be successful. The budding of the hibiscus represents the time when she�ll be prepared to take the test. Though she is having a tough tine now, she'll be able to get through it and make another attempt. This paragraph is at the end because it brings together the purpose of the hibiscus. Without saying this, the readers would have never gotten this message, instead, they would believe that the role of the hibiscus was to serve as a connection to Saeng�s past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph was included to show readers that everyone can balance back from a bad situation.	3	3		3																					
3367	4	One it could mean she can only take the test in the spring. But also because her surroundings during that period relaxed heR. When she was dissapointed and @CAPS1 about her driving failing grade.	1	1		1																					
3368	4	The author concludes the story with this @CAPS1 because she really cared the hibiscus. She said this because she was comparing her test to the hibiscus. When the hibiscus will budding she will take the test again. Hibiscus is everything far her. it is her good luck. And with hibiscus budding she can make her new life. withaut the hibiscus plant she was laser �I-I failed the test� and �I baught it,� saeng answered reading her mother�s next questian.� She was so depressed with her test failing that why she baught hibiscus to influence her life. she decided when it will spring with hibiscus budding she will start her new life by giving the test again and providing her self how important hibiscus	1	2		2																					
3373	4	" The author used the paragraph telling about how saeng would test in the spring at the end of the story because,the words used and the way it is read can tell the reader that saeng is at peace and accepts the fact that she lives in the u.s. When Saeng says,�and this hibiscus plant is budding,"" she is thinking about how the plant reminds her of her native country. Also when she says, ""Then I will take this test again� she is promising herself that she will take the test when she feels at home in her new country. Saeng also is in a way telling herself that she should accept the fact that she has moved and that she can still be reminded of her native country with the new hibiscus plant and many other things."	2	2		2																					
3375	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the willingness of Saeng to overcome the obstacles and adapt to her new life. The hibiscus discussed in the ending quote describes Saeng�s new hope and determination to succeed in the United States. For example in the text it states,""� its fine petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.� When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to the together her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents newhope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually succeed. In addition, in the text it says, �it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.� Saeng�s past memones could be reached when this hibiscus was in new and that served as immense inspiration to her. The author ended the story with Saeng�s new recollection and hope to prove that she had indeed found something helpful and stable in a new world."	3	3		3																					
3379	4	The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason @MONTH1 be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. �Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too but they come back every year. Along with the flower Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do. She won�t give up but try again later on in the year. This shows how she is adapting and changing to work with her new surrondings.	3	2		3																					
3380	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng�s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says �vowed� to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� familiar.� The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time.	2	2		2																					
3381	4	In the story, �winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. That is why she bought the flowers. At the end of the story she vows,� In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home.	2	1		2																					
3382	4	The author had the story end with the paragraph because all the ideas are brought together and to show that Saeng is ready for whats ahead. When they put in the flower they are concluding the flowers importance and how it relates to how the girl feels being happy or sad. Yet when she says that she vowed... and shed take the test again she saying that she is ready for whats ahead but will be open minded to whats new so that she can see were she�s gone from. Therefore the author ends with that paragraph to leave mystry for what happend and to conclude.	2	2		2																					
3384	4	The author uses this as an ending paragraph in the story because the next year at the same time she will take the test of life over again.	0	0		0																					
3386	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the main character is troubled because they moved away from home and the culture, customs and even food are different .Therefore, the main character has difficulty adapting to her new environment. The author concludes the ending statement to show that she will not stop trying to achieve her goal. She wants to take the test again change to see if over time things @MONTH1 have changed. The story is very emotional and expresses a great deal of sorrow that is overcome in the end.	2	2		2																					
3393	4	This author concludes the story with this paragraph, because they both where talking about the cold or the weather and the @CAPS1 so it sated when snows melt as it talkes about weather or the @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
3397	4	The author concludes the story with this piece because she said �a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,� I think she means that even tho the geese flew over with their heads up high even tho Saeng�s wasn�t. �Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time. She looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad.	2	2		2																					
3399	4	I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese.	0	0		0																					
3405	4	The  author includes that sentence of the end of the story because through out the story it was showing  courage,and that explains her getting better and showing  courage that she is going to go back and try to pass that test and not letting it get her down that she failed the first time.	1	1		1

3421	4	In the quote above it is telling that saeng is glad to be back. Saeng also states that she would be ready to do it again if she had to.	1	1		1																					
3422	4	I think  the author concluded the story like that is because it was cold outside. I also think that the author is trying to say is that when she wrote this letter it was cold outside and she wouldn�t take the test until it was warm again because of the cold. �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again.� 	0	0		0																					
3424	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because if the author trys it again it might work out a lot better now they know what they are doing. Also if they try it again then if it makes enough they can sell it and make money so they will keep doing it for years to come.	0	0		0																					
3425	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with a resolution of Saeng in order to show how Saeng will not give up and how she is determined. The reference to the spring blossoms shows how Saeng will fight to survive through the hardships, which are represented by winter. Just like the hibiscus that struggles to adapt to a new home, Saeng is struggling to adapt to a new country the final paragraph provides a resolution to the internal conflict of Saeng throughout the story by suggesting that Saeng will succeed in taking the test. In conclusion, the final paragraph in the story �Winter Hibiscus� provides a resolution to the conflict in the story, and shows the reader Saeng�s determination.	2	2		2																					
3426	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because It show what Saeng will be doing and If she will go to school. Saeng didn't want to go school because she will wait For the snow to melt ond the geese return and this hibiscus is bucking, and prefers gardening to school. and garden remind For about her homeland. For @CAPS1 Saeng dug out hole and carefully lowered the winter hibiscus into it. The thing that made her thing about her homeland was the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan, The pungent smell of better melon wafled out. Another @CAPS1 she went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground, that show she care about the garden.	1	1		1																					
3434	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng did not give up on the test. for example, she says �I will take the test again.� It shows that she wants to take the test and pass it. Saeng is going to wait until spring comes and when the snow melts to take the test. In the beginning in the box above, it talks about her taking the test. Then it ends with her going to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3445	4	The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the �Madagascar periwinkle� growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.  	1	1		1																					
3447	4	They conclude the story with that because the winter is over and spring is here and it will be beautiful again	0	0		0																					
3449	4	 The author of �Winter Hibiscus� decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to @LOCATION1 and has had a rough time fitting in. She misses everything about her old home, from her grandmother to the old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels that all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the winter and bloom in the spring and that is what Saeng realizes she must do. The last paragraph said �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Spring is the time for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers start to bloom, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes she wants a new beginning as well to be brought I the spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph ties the theme of new beginnings into the story. It shows @CAPS1 new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it. 	3	2		3																					
3459	4	The resoned the author concludes the story with this paragraph because I she fail the test and make your learned to apprecite nature a litter bitter.	1	1		1																					
3460	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring.	0	0		0																					
3461	4	The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means.	1	1		1																					
3463	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is willing to give the test another try. She is now more open �minded about the situation. In the beginning of the story, Saeng was upset and annoyed about failing her driver�s test. For example, �the tearstains on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I-I failed the test,� Saeng said to her mother. Obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself. The author didn�t want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending. Saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. For example, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� I believe that this attitude was because of the memorys of her mother country that soothes her and also her mother. In conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal.	2	3		3																					
3464	4	"The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the motivational paragraph  because he/she wants to show the reeder that  Saeng is determined to adapt to her new life and home and overcome common  obstacles like a driver's test. Saeng had a hard time coping with her problem so she bought a hibiscus because it reminded her of home. I think that the line �and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" from the last paragraph is a symbol for growing up and overcoming obstacles. The conclusion for the story is a nice ending."	2	2		2																					
3472	4	The author concludes her story with that last paragraph because it shows the relasonship between saeng and the habiscas, and how much just seeing it feels. It also shows that the habiscus  motivates her because it reminds her of her home land that she loves so much and that its like have a pysical memorie of her home land	1	1		1																					
3473	4	The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects.	1	2		2																					
3474	4	I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize�s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her.	2	1		2																					
3476	4	I think the author concludes the story with that saying because it shows that she is adappting to the new place. It @CAPS1 shows that she isent going to give up. Just like the geese don�t give up flying back and forth ever winter and spring. 	1	1		1																					
3479	4	I think that the author concludes the story like this because it shows a new beginning. When the spring comes, everything comes back to life. Plants grow back, animals are seen again and the sun shines bright. This is a new beginning for them so it can be seen the same for her. She could try again because it gives her another chance. Another reason he ended the story like this is because Saeng loves nature. Maybe when nature is back around her it will give her hope and confidence to pass her test.	1	1		1																					
3480	4	The last paragraph of the story was: �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that she is adapting and that she is starting to accept the change. I think that because throughout the story she is upset and not really liking the change. �And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� The text says. This last paragraph seems optimistic talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning which seems like she is starting to accept the change. In my opinion, the author added  that paragraph to finish the story to show that Saeng is starting to accept the change and be optimistic.	2	2		2																					
3481	4	Saeng told her mother that she failed the test. She she what to make up for it. By helping out in the graden. Her mother usher in and started to make dinner.	1	1		1																					
3484	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line �.. Slowly fading into the distance.� Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line �� Through the quiet repition of season upon season.�. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it.	1	2		2																					
3487	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes the story a happy ending how she doesn�t give up and is taking the test again. Also she doesn�t want to disappoint her mom she wants to make her happy and give the test a second chance.	1	1		1																					
3492	4	"To me it seam like the whoever was saying that must of been going through a lot of things and that they was feeling like they were being tested or something or maybe somebody left her that she really loved because it say �when they come back"" so @CAPS1 thinking somebody @MONTH1 have left or something."" And the reason I said that the person @MONTH1 have feel as if they were being tested because it says �I will take the test again.�"	0	0		0																					
3493	4	The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomforalable. For example when she broke down in the flower shop. This shows that even though things can remind her of home it isn�t the same. You have to get used to and become accostumed to a new place. This also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test.	2	2		2
