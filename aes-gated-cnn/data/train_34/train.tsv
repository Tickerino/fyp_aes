2	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. He was in the desert, which is dry and hot. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the  temperature was hot and made every thing around him hot, �brackish water faling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Since he was in the desert, there was no escape from the sun. The text  states, �The sun was beginning to beat down�(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out, no one could help him. � and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgous day in June�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town� but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). Thesettings that the cyclist was riding in wasn't good ones and so they negativly affected him; causing him to be dehydrated and tiredin the end."	2	2		2																					
4	3	I believe the features of the cyclist affected him because he was impatient and trustworthy he tock the old mens advice to take an hr of his time bay taking a short cat, if he would of stayed true to the mep he wouldn�t of almost ared of heat but his impatientress got the best of him so he took the shortcut. After his experence he new haes to stat ?? to the mep and not trust people who havent seen changes in the last few years.  	1	1		1																					
10	3	In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, �the sun was beginning to beat down.� @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drain�s a person�s energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; �The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskie�s story, �Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.  	2	3		3																					
11	3	The setting of the authors � shortcut� effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well.� Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills.� The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views.� I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill.� The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said, � success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts.� I believe that @PERSON2 agrees.	3	2		3																					
13	3	"There was many features that affected the cyclist such as heat and lack of water. The cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having little water left. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� That shows he wasn�t prepared with enough water for his trip to Yosemite. Without water he/she would die from the heat. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke"" This states that he @CAPS1 the danger of not having enough water in his system. Features such as water and heat affected him/her throughout the story. Not having enough water could make him/her lose more sweat and the heat is making him lose even more sweat which can cause extreme heatstroke."	3	2		3																					
17	3	Many different characteristics in a setting and determine the outcome of an event there. Im the story, Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the cyclists journey was affected my a few weather relouded things. The heat was an extreme thing that showed him down and in most cases detened him from reading his maximum level of ability. Also the time of your in which this labes place, greatly affects the cyclist. Lastly, the type of road and amount of ground that he has to cover after affects his performance. Overall, setting can be a determining factor in a journey as they life	2	2		2																					
19	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� by @PERSON1, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way the setting affects the cyclist is, in the desert, the cyclist drank more water than before. For example, the text states �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you.	1	1		1																					
20	3	"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, �a tarlike substance oozed out� of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to �short, rolling hills�, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
21	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, out of date information, and rolling hills. If he had up to date information then he would probably have got water from a town that�s not empty or almost empty like a �ghost town� as the cyclist said.	2	1		2																					
22	3	The cyclist has a couple things if he racing and the wind is blowing then theres a problem and he has to follow traffic law and ride on the right side or the road.	0	1		1																					
23	3	�Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� had a  rough setting between harzardous things and the death defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination. He had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life. He was travelling through a desert and claimed the temperature was @NUM1.Also, the cyclist had to ration his water because it was ghost towns in which our character passed through. He used nature skills he�d once learned and began to suck on pebbles which take the mind off thirst and uses saliva to help refresh your throat. Throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster. He had survived and wouldn�t ever take shortcuts again	2	2		2																					
24	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the lock of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. He frind the water but e tar like substance come out and it tasted like battery. When he left he had to go through rough road which he couldn�t travel that fast leanes of the condition of the road.	1	1		1																					
28	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way. This ways are pysical and mental. The pysical ways that features affect cyclist is the terrain. If the roads are long and wiredy, this could wear the cyclist out. They could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep. When it�s you against gravity, it can be egausting. The temperature can also be a crusal factor in a cyclist pysical ability. Nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding. The cyclist and also be attracted mentally. If the terrain looks deserted or anything like a desert the byciclist instintaniously thinks �dehydration� and �death.� If some people see dead animals or bones they would think they could die. If they see vulture circling them they would get afraid and think death, but the worse thing of all is that knowing all of these things are in the same place at the same time. This is how setting affects cyclists	3	2		3																					
33	3	In the essay the mshan writes of rough rodes timit the cyclist�s had to overcome to reach @CAPS1 gole.	1	1		1																					
34	3	Understanding, realitic, mode-all are reason�s how setting affects the setting. If a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good. When you have a setting it�s more understable of what they are trying today. And if you have a good setting it makes it more realitic So when you read it you wont be thrown off, the mode of the story sets it all off, because usually books have there ups and downs. That�s why they chase the mode.  	0	0		0																					
35	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by making him dehydrated which could lead to a heatstroke. �I could drop from a heatstroke� this shows that it was hot out and he was feeling bad if he could have dropped from a heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
36	3	"The terrain during the cyclist�s journey greatly affects him. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing. The author stated, �I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� This shows that he was energized and happy. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, especially because he had no water left. The cyclist said, �sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn.  This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are include, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did. "	3	2		3																					
38	3	The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren�t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men�s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story.	3	2		3																					
39	3	The setting in the story changes many times. It starts in an area with rivers and pine trees. Then the cyclist arrives ant a town. After that he is pounded by the hot sun and along hilly road. With not much water left the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink. The setting was what made the cyclists journey a hard one.	1	1		1																					
41	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the desert with no water and doesnt know where he is going. The old men on the porch gave him wrong directions now he is lost in the desert. The cyclist find the will power to keep on moving and he finds help along the way. He finds another old man there that offer him directions but he says he has a map	1	1		1																					
42	3	The setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is, �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� He uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says, �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting. He describes the intense heat inthe desert of California, pedaling up, � one long, crippling hill.� The terrain did not make his rideeasy at all. The factor of weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water take a tall on him. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine.	2	2		2																					
43	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty. The bumpy roods and hills make him work harder. The abandoned places make him lose hope. If faced with these obstacles I would have been affected in the same way. As I believe any human would be.	1	2		2																					
44	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist.The features of the setting, or nature, affect the cyclist because they are wearing her out. The cyclist is going to the city of of yosemite but some guys gave her a short cut. Through this shortcut are hills and heat and lack of water. @CAPS1 describes this by saying, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.� @CAPS1 is excited that there is a building that @CAPS1 might get some water from. Also, @CAPS1 wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and @CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. Therefore, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
45	3	The three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling, the towns he passes, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is important because the rougher the terrain, and the more hills there are, the more energy he must use, and the less distance he can travel. @PERSON1 is riding fine until he must travel the rolling hills which consume his energy, ehausts his water, and causes dividing hope. As he approaches towns, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be unable of giving him relief. When he pumps out water that tastes like �battery acid,� his hope once again diminishes. As he sees the bait and tackle shop, he knows he can make it there and that when he gets there he can recover. These three features are what effects the cyclist the most.	2	2		2																					
46	3	In the story of �rough road ahead :do not exceed posted limit� the setting affected the cyclist. In the middle of the desert during the summer the cyclist was low on water. The old men gave him the wrong directions, so mainly it is the old guys thought he dies. The cyclist survives but the heat and the season he was riding he�ll probably bring another water botlle nextime	1	1		1																					
50	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� All the road was hills and rough. Than �The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.� @CAPS1 doesn�t have that much water. That was really hard.	2	1		2																					
52	3	The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist �traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.� He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank �water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure.	3	2		3																					
53	3	The narration of �Rough Road ahead� a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story. The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite national park from the none of the old men his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his deserve and need for water. The text states �I had been huting my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June�. To disappointed the truck stop�s water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his concumption, only forcing him to link elsewhere to quench his thirst next, he explenced rolling hills by exsercising more energy he made his way now everyone still in need of water. His spend lost his quickness as thoughts of his crippling dyhydration distracted him. He wer came his challenges making his was to a bate shop as the heat beat him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his heath and created a obstraction that nearly deterred him from his goal.	3	2		3																					
54	3	The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
55	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the main character the cyclist. The cyclist is biking �through the high desert of california in June.� So naturally it can be infereal that it is not and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases �a tarlike substance followed by brackish water� he is runningout of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that �l cald drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service causing more anxiousness and dispare l have had an experience similar to this where l wat out walking in a state park in the @DATE1. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow covered trees made me feel at if I�d never be warm again similar to He cyclist who�s environment made him feel hes wald die of dehydration. So, as can be seen. He setting of this short story affects the cyclist.   	3	3		3																					
58	3	"I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills� this shows that he is a warm and trobled by the change of the terrain. He also fells alone �I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path� he also. Though he was in a ghost town. �Summer time� rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my detorating brain"" he felt that he was slowly dying. He also though he was losing it, the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was no seeing a mirage. But through it all he had hopes the author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things dont look good keep moving foward never look back and alway's be positive and take advanage of your surrounding. This is the message the author tries to give"	2	2		2																					
60	3	The features of the setting effects the cyclist by the way that the auther started talking and how he sound at the beginning of the story. When they both at the picture he looks like hes cecilla ssing and then ceoos. To the story and goo continue ties reads. It doesn�t sound like he is enjoying his ride, because of the niuse he was down on the bumpy roads, sparkes, and the bor of counter tirst he doesn�t have. hes sacting time and sec from add perso doesn�t mic at all because there could hou old �timers and don�t know once thou are tailoring around her, to save, to goo shouldn�t take advice from them because goo could end its line this nidsnes transitin califend doesn�t and how feres how could now do it, to let some or therefore so be dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
65	3	The setting effected the cyclist in a great way. The snakes blocked his pathways, and hi short water supply made it hard to continue. He felt as if he could drop of a heatstroke. His environment, and the information from the old man made his ride very hard to continue. All in all, his settings had a big effect on him.	1	1		1																					
69	3	The features of setting  really effects the cyclist because of the condition. For example, the weather, it is hot, it will slow the person down. And if it�s perfect that will let the person go at regular speed. And the roads, if the road is bumpy that will slow them down. And if its smooth that will speed them up. See, it really does depend on the condition.	1	1		1																					
70	3	"The setting affects the  author alot. First he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out. This makes the cyclist very tired. There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one  to help him if he were to have a heat stroke."	1	1		1																					
71	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist traveled miles on a bike dealing with the weather in the deserts, little bit of water, and being tired. The cyclist faced many hard times trying to travel on a bicycle from one point to another.	1	1		1																					
72	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist�s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly� If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, � I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph� This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story.	3	3		3																					
73	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty ��. I came to a fork of sorts, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling. �when she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be @NUM1 degrees. �Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. �This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. It was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding	1	1		1																					
74	3	How the setting of the place effects the cyclist is for one its to dry a cyclist would be ridy for haurst shouldn�t be in a place that�s dry.Like in the story it says �I was travelling through the high parts of California in June� meaning it was really hot and dry.Second would be the animals there dangerous.A cyclist should be riding in a place with diamond back snakes it says in the text �I toiled on.At some point,tumbleweeds crossed my path t a ridiculously larger skilt it really did look like adiamond back� which if it really has one would be really dangerous  & cyclist should not be riding in that type of dangerous places no matter what type there are.That is how the settings of the surrandings effect the cyclist & how can it�s a bad place for them to ride.	2	2		2																					
75	3	The features of the setting affect the cylceist by the ground would change terrian a lot makeing it difficult to ride at the same speed the entire way. Also, the lack of water made it hard to focus. I think the features of the setting affect the cycleist by people think they are worse than the actually are.	1	1		1																					
76	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.	1	1		1																					
80	3	The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the �town� had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this �town� is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road.	2	1		2																					
81	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over, �short rolling hills,� and arround a,�ridiculously large snake,� and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut. So yes the author is affected by the setting	1	1		1																					
83	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, �Rough Road Ahead� which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."	3	3		3																					
84	3	 The bike rider in the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by @PERSON1, is greatly affected by the condition of land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running, low on water. However since it is such a dry place he can�t find any. Also since it is out in the middle of no where, there is no one he can ask for some. If this story was set somewhere else he wouldn�t have has either problems.	1	1		1																					
90	3	The setting and it`s features affect the cyclist greatly. He is in the desert and all the town's are abandoned. Also he now hits a sign that says �Rough Road Ahead�(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1). This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up, old, beaten roads. And he has the sun beating down and is almost out of water.	2	1		2																					
92	3	The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
94	3	In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. �Not two miles into the next section.� He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. �I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� It get harder and harder to continue his ride.	2	2		2																					
98	3	There are @NUM1 features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobody�s there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist.  Furthermore he�s in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about @NUM2 or @NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobody�s around town in able to help him out or anything. Let�s say that he gets lost and he�ll need direction to get wherever he�s going well there�s nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the @NUM1 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist. 	1	2		2																					
99	3	The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn�t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
100	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The cyclist also had a lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map.	2	2		2																					
101	3	"In the text, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. For example, the text states, �There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.� This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch�s Grape Juice factory� This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited. Lastly, the text states, �GRAPE AND @CAPS1�S FISH CAMP� The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. The setting�s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."	2	3		3																					
103	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
104	3	Sun, amount of miles, people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot. Also, he said that he really didn�t seem to notice it through in his mind it affected the cyclist. Next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept,	1	1		1																					
108	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if says �there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"". This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around."	1	1		1																					
110	3	"The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. The text says, �The sun was beginning to beat down�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The hot sun was making the cyclist sweat. He was losing water. This was making him dehadrayted faster. The text says. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to ride up were wearing him out. He was getting tierd faster. The text says. �I stubled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The modern bathroom had good, cold water. This allowed the cylist to drink from it. The water replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain some of his strength. Then the cyclist could carry on."	2	2		2																					
114	3	The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact was June , hes in the desert and has low on water were what almost lead to his own down fall. This hot desert setting sounds hostile and am I�m surprised he lived and that he was that lucky.	1	1		1																					
115	3	The features of the setting had misled the cyclist. When he had first left the town where the old men adviced him cyclist had high hopes as a looked and senery enjoyed seeing very ? of the struggle.	1	1		1																					
117	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man�s journey he was confident in his abilities. �I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.�  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June� without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey. "	3	3		3																					
118	3	"The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, �affect  the cyclist in major ways. First, when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, he is reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living. The text states, ��A young   pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung  my head �   (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). The  text later states, "" At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..."" (kurmaskie). This tells that the cyclist feels de pressed and is majorly affected by these sights. This could and would later ruin his self esteem and think about diying."	2	2		2																					
121	3	The features that set the affect of the cyclist is very clear in case of this essay which resene when it @CAPS1 the signs  that said �Rough @CAPS2 ahead: Do not Exceed posted Speed Limit.� That had to slow down his bike. �Then he said that their were no building or cars nowhere	1	1		1																					
124	3	The cyclist trusted a man that didn`t know much about the world, he thought that the guy would know how to get to the place he was looking for. The cyclist took his advice, he thought that he would be there really soon so he start to drink his water really fast. He realized that he was out of water and the park he was going to wasen�t anywhere near. The cyclist got frustrated and angry he was now crossing the desert which was making him tiered and dehydrated. He pased this road that was a rough road with tumbleweeds and snakes he kept on going until he sow the �@CAPS1 Juice� company. He hurried there, went into the bathroom drank same water. When he got out an old men asked if he needed directions, the cyclist said no.	2	2		2																					
129	3	In the story �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The most challenging problem faced  by the author was the lack of water. � I pumped that handle for several minutes but the water wouldn�t calm down nor I tried a drip or two,it had the flaver of beatterly acid.When @CAPS2 set out for the next train @CAPS2 came to a road that read �Rough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. The tarrain got more bumpy & hard to cross. The effected the determination the cyclist had left @CAPS2 the regreted not listening to the old men of didn�t think they knew what they were talking about. Due to the fact they never left their porches. As you can see the setting most deffinated effected the cyclist in physical or mental ways.	2	2		2																					
132	3	'Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. First off, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle. This affected her because if they had been in a car, or on a bus alot less energy would have been used up. Secondly, the cyclist started running out of water. This setting didn�t help because they were on a bike so that kept them hydrated. Another setting that affected the plot was the deserted towns. If they hadn�t been deserted everything would have been better. These features affected the cyclist a great deal.	1	2		2																					
133	3	The features of the setting affects the cycles such that it was affecting his altermmation to continue. For example, after @NUM1 miles he looked upon the �ramshackeled sched, several rusty bumps and the corral� This sight troubled me. In the desert his water tasted like the flavor of �battery acid.� It also goes on to say that it was a �test for my inner spirit.� It also states that he went along with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds. This passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did and made it with a little confidence. Although his situation was somewhat unbearable he still kept striving on.	2	2		2																					
134	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in most of the story. The heat made him hot & thirsty while the travel gave him a lack of energy and even     of a need for water. In paragraph @NUM1 the writer says one of the hills was �long and a               � The hill was wearing him out & draining what was left of his energy. The setting of the story was the biggest party if the road was flat and bumpy while the tempeture was	1	1		1																					
135	3	The setting easily can affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in which the cyclist was in the seemed to be abandoned which doesn�t give a well thinking to this person . If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won�t be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly infront of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist. The conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him.	3	3		3																					
137	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting. The features are just not right and and they could be changed around a little bit and still have about the same meaning of the essay. So I think they should change it around.	1	2		2																					
138	3	The features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist. He is going on this bike ride through the deserts of �california in June. This obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very fast. At one point he says, �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed.� @CAPS1, the setting of having all these ghost towns was troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beggining to rum out of water.  The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� When your petalling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you. If he was in a different setting this felling of despair would not be      in the story. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
143	3	The features of the setting greatly  effected the cyclist.  He was  riding along   on a  route he had little confidence would end up anywhere. That being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework. The temperature was very hot, where was little shade, the   sun was beating down on him. The route was very discouraging .all the cyclist wanted wanted   was water and the route kept touenting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that approved to be an old bottling factory for Welch�s  grape  juice. The cyclist would appear  to be closing in on something to drink, but be left with nothing.	3	2		3																					
145	3	The byciclist from �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit� was effected in many ways from the environment. The most talked about feature in the environment was the lack of water. The byciclist was going to die because there was no water and he was really dehydrated. Another feature was the heat. It was really hotwhere the narrator was bycicling. When @CAPS1 hot, the heat dehydrates you. So the narrator was being pushed to the limit because of the heat. Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was hauntinghim until he got mad at the lodgers hetalked to and was really frustrated. The smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills, which made it harder for him to ride. Lastly, the snake inthe road affected him because he had to avoid it. All of these things affected him. 	2	0		3																					
147	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by one, the conditions of the road were awful. Two, the cyclist said there was a huge snake blocking his path as well as the occasional tumble weed. The biggest affect on the cyclist was the lack of water with unbearable heat and he was tired. Those are the affects the features of the setting had on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
154	3	This is how the setting effects the cyclist. One is the hot dry California desert heat. It was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water. The hot desert heat had made water a for like a substance which he could not drink from the well. The water bottle only containe a few tentalizing sips which was not enough to quench his thirst. The hot heat that would make birds pick him drys all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice. It made him realice that in time comes wisely and youth can make silly mistakes. The heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive. That is ho the setting effects the cyclest.	3	3		3																					
155	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn�t have much water to drink.	1	1		1																					
156	3	Many features in the setting affect the cyclist. Several main features include the cars lading town. that aint really towns anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could give him water, but it was all run down and weakened. �I arrived at the first �town�. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.� He is saying that the town could�ve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed He tried to pump water but got no success. �I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldn�t cool down.� A working water pump would�ve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading	2	2		2																					
157	3	This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills. Another example would be �high deserts of California in June.� That�s saying its hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the �summer time� its very tiring. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  	1	2		2																					
158	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster. The road might be up the hill so he @MONTH1 go slow. There could be a possibility that the road might have bump rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through. So the affect of the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made.	1	1		1																					
159	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink.	2	2		2																					
160	3	In �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the cyclists was effected by the features of the setting. She was first effected by the old men which told her a �shortcut� to her ride to Yosemite National Park. Then she was effected by a ghost towns which had no water to give her. Then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweed and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by. Then at the end she came upon �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� where she decided to make decisions herself. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way except �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� which saved her from dehydration.	2	2		2																					
162	3	The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable. Riding on rough roads, braking, speeding, chains in good conditions. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These typess of things @MONTH1 help determine how settings can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
163	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The @LOCATION1 desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist. For example the was further route, he takes is not only @LOCATION1, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he @MONTH1 restock on water and become hydrated once again.	2	2		2																					
165	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says � The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was don�t ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh�. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back.. Blocked the major of the parement in front of me""."	3	2		3																					
167	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he�ll have later on. As he passes a snake, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� So the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, ��I could drop from heatstroke�� meaning he�s starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. Which effects him because he�s beginning to loose hope and  thinks he�s not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�� By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story.	2	3		3																					
168	3	"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of no  where that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those @NUM1 also said, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (@PERSON1). I dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work."	2	2		2																					
170	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist. 	1	2		2																					
171	3	The features of the settings in �Do not exceed the posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through todi, California which is a rough area to ride. The ride was hot and long that he was so dehidrated that sweat was dried around his neck. The solo cyclist says �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� He had no where to get water or food. It was deserted. He thought if he died no one would find him faster the birds would pick him clean. The essay �rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by @PERSON1 shows a solo cycilist are very independent.	2	2		2																					
174	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...� This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip.  "	2	2		2																					
177	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a lot of ways. in the essay, the author describe how the setting is hot, it is bumpy, it makes him sweat, it makes him tired, he is also, running out of water from his thirst. The road gets, very rocky at one point. The narrator states �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (Kurmaskie @NUM1). There is also a photograph that shows how rough the terrain is. It is barrain with nothing around it.	1	1		1																					
178	3	The feature�s of the setting affect the cyclist because, the cyclist is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he�s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn�t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. �Rough road ahead.�  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
180	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit, the faetures of the setting effect the cyclist. To keep cool on a hot summer day, is might be neccessary for one to find shade. Just to add to the misfortune of the story. There was no one in eight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" This factor does not help the cyclist at all, infact, all it does is make the cyclist more  exhausted. Another element in the story that effects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tatalizing sips."" With more miles to go,the cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to  add to his misfortune, ""flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the hills are short, they still could have put impact on him because of the ropolalive hills. Many features of the story effected the mood of the story."	2	3		3																					
181	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. It affected him because it was saying @NUM1 miles and then were in the first town, thinking that the cyclist was getting excited and he was kind of all most done he thought he was going at a fast past. When the cyclist got to the first town he said that it looked dead. And then after he kept moving he kind of knew that he wasnt getting anywhere. Then after thinking he noticed that he had listened to some old folks that had never even been off their porch. So after the cyclist had hit the first town he had known right then and there that ho should never listen to old folkes ever again. Because that first town had looked like nobody has been in it for years.	2	2		2																					
183	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, the road could be bumpy, and the town could be deserted. For example, ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty. And if he is not and with no water he probably could  barely make it up the hills. And with no town for water he would be thirsty.""First ""town"" This place might have been a thriving little spot at one point but anthor warning it fit the outsides of ghost town"" No waters"	2	2		2																					
184	3	Hot, lack of water, lost-all are how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, it was hot. In one sentence he say the sun was beginning to beat down. Also that the water felt around two-hundred degrees. That sweat was all over him. So he had to be really hot. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performence. How was because he was dieing in need of water. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong and the trip wasnt what he expected. But in the end he was relifed. So even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive. Basically this story is explaining how if you try your hardest, never give up, and try new things you are most likely to succeed in life and other things you @MONTH1 take part of. So try your best and make way of your life and plans in your life.	2	2		2																					
186	3	The cyclist lost hope because he was in the California desserts in June. The cyclist started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump that pumped out battery-acid tasting water. When he said the sign �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, was very cautious. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist was in the California desert and that made him think he was going to die out there.	2	2		2																					
187	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his trying biking trip through California. In the essay, he describes the weather with �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� While this @MONTH1 not directly characterice the weather, the reader can confin a clear image of the sweltering heat of a desert in the summer. When the author comes across the �ghost town� followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read �Rough Road Ahead,� his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.�"	3	3		3																					
188	3	The setting affects of the cyclist was that the exhaustion was getting to him. What made it worse he was out in the heat sweating which also cause dihidration.	1	1		1																					
189	3	To begin with a feature that affect the cyclist was a lack of water this is shown when the speaker says when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid-thats was one of the biggest factors he had risked. 	3	2		3																					
190	3	As the reader listened and followed the directions of the old-timers he faced many issues and also learned a leason. As he began to ride into the day break of morning he had strong legs and even a smile on his face. As time went on he soon became close out of water and a loss of energy. The @CAPS1 summer day made him sweat and began to think that he birds would pluk at his body as if he would die on his ride to Yosemite. When he finally got to a town he soon refreashed and learned that he would and start to began to follow his own way: of getting to places	2	2		2																					
191	3	The features of the setting in the essay �Do not exceed the posted speed limit� affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn�t make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far , I�d be fine�. He seemed unsure and a little nervous. As the journey continued, the cyclist loses hope it seems. �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary� He does not see himself finishing this journey the more and more he rides in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except �Rough Road Ahead� signs.  	2	2		2																					
193	3	"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The rolling hills were the cyclist�s most challenging problem because they were long and cripppling. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatsroke. However, the cyclist kept a possitive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and wilbells fish camp.� In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort. But with determination,you can accomplish anything!  "	3	3		3																					
195	3	Some features of the setting setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said �I wipe the sweat from my eyes.�	1	1		1																					
199	3	In the story the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest problems was the terrian that he had to maneuver them. The terrain was hilly, having to go up a hill on a bike is tireing and wears you out faster than flat land would, and making him use more energy. The heat was also unbearable making it harder for him to focus, the cyclist did everything he could to keep consiese while  manuvering threu the terrain and deserted landscape being a huge desert of rolling mountains he pushed forwad, finding no civilization anywhere to get a refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn�t as hilled then it would of made it easier for him using less energy and less strain on his legs, the heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress also. Heat will make you move slower and a cyclist moving down a  barnest road with no shade will make the journey seem longer, and imposible. In the end his will and determination got with threw the landscape, so he could get the water he needed to finish his trip	2	2		2																					
201	3	The setting of where you are riding has alot to do with the cyclist. In my own opinion I think the setting is the most important part.	2	2		2																					
204	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summer�s day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, �.I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.� (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except �Old timers who haven�t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing� (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor. It can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting.	2	3		3																					
205	3	The terrain in �Do not exeed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, �I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.  	2	3		3																					
206	3	In the story �Rough road ahead� the setting affect�s the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by lack of water, the distance he has to travel, and the hilly terrain. �The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,� this statement shows how he was out of water and was tired and hot. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in the story.	1	1		1																					
207	3	The cyclist has it hard in the conditions lack of water, heat and rough terrain are all things that made his ride harder. First, the lack of water took a tole on the amount of energy he had to keep going. Secont the heat also affected his trip It mad it hard for him to Keep going he thought he would die. And the birds would bick at his dead body. Last the Terrain didn�t help. The trip had many hills and that used alot of energy so I made it harder. In conclusion those are things that worked against th cyclist.	2	2		2																					
208	3	In this I will tell you how the cyclist was being effected. One way is the heat caused him to drink more then her ran out of water. The next was is the misleading old guys that gave him ba directions. Another way was being the long distance and bad terrain slowing him down. The last reason is the snake that slowed him down.	1	2		2																					
209	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. He was riding his bike across a place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food. It was a dangerous journey for him but he made it.	1	1		1																					
210	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. one example is, the condition of his jar	0	0		0																					
212	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there are no cars, building, water, or people in sight. It goes from flat road to rolling hills. Even though he had no water he was determined to keep pedeling. �Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit� At this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation I would feel hopeless. There was no sign of hope. He just saw endless rolling hills and that was all. Then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free. So he pedeled up to the building, and that with all the others was abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die. In conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope. If he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case. He is in the middle of nowhere. He finally came to bend and say �Then, as easily as randing a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.�	2	2		2																					
214	3	The features of the setting that the author cyclist through definitely effect not only his mood, but his the physical condition. To start, it is mentioned that he is in �the high deserts California in June,� @CAPS1 it is implied that the weather is hot causing the author to sweat as he bikes along. Next there is a change in terrain an he soon approaches �rolling hills� which are more difficult to bike on. Finally the author sees a sign that reads �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit but he still has to manage getting past the rough road. After passing this road he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated before. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the author�s change in mood.  	3	3		3																					
215	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun. The heat dyhydrates and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor. It takes up the time and energy he has to preform. Another key ingreedient of the setting was the desert. There was no one to help him and there wasn't a place to get water. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story.	1	1		1																					
217	3	  The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist was faced with a desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die��. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst. Over all, the setting caused the cyclist major problems, physically, and mentally.	3	3		3																					
218	3	The ways that can effects the cyclist by the setting of the place are how the road is shaped or the riding up the hills and the roughness of the rode. There were an sign where it said �rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit.� That sign if he didn�t see it he would have over the speed or didn�t know what the speed he was to go as a cyclist and gotten hurt. The road was made for the cars so the speed limit is hard to	1	1		1																					
219	3	In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist. One setting that affected him was the first setting. I this setting he used up his water and it was hot. this affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die. The text shoud this when it said �I could drop from heat stroke�, later when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory he thought about how thirsty he was. This affected him because usually when you think about thirst you get thirsty er. This also made him dis apointed. The finale setting affected him because he had finally got water and wasn�t thirsty. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
220	3	"On that long bike ride the cyclist was affected by the setting. He was affected of the lack water, the heat and the bad directions, throughout the story the cyclist ran out of water due to bad directions from some men.""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride.� I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men.� Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information. But not the land has changed and the directions were wrong. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help. The cyclist experienced how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal."	2	3		3																					
229	3	the way I would set my affected cyclist is by him riding throught. Something u would never thing he can set thought then over coming his intention.	0	0		0																					
230	3	The features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead� affect the cyclist. The cyclist started at a camp ground and conversing with some old dogers, and he asks them how to get to Yosemite, and the tell him a shortcut that turns out to be out of date. On the road to Yosemite he sees nothing except abandoned towns. He is really thirsty and there�s no water anywhere. He thought he was going to die. He said, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It was a hot summer day and there was tumbleweeds and snakes by the road and him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it was cooler and if there was a big river flowing by the road. But it was hot and dry in California and desert-like and it made him feel like he was dying because he was in the middle of nowhere therefore the setting affected the cyclist	3	2		3																					
232	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclist�s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up �Ghost towns� and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says �what I believed was my last burst of energy,� �I was going to die.� The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die.	2	2		2																					
233	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason the features of the setting affect him is because it is hot outside which makes him need more water. An example of this is �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 example of being hot outside is �A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� 	1	1		1																					
236	3	Being a cyclist and in the condition he was in would be even worse in the setting he was in, such as the heat of California, and difficult condition of the path he was on. Him being so hot and tired from the difficult hilly trail would be worse with having the lack of supply of water. The author was very dehydrated and was on the verge of fainting. If it were not so hot, the cyclist would have been in a much better condition.	1	1		1																					
237	3	The cyclist in the article almost died from dehydration and heat stroke and wrote his misadventure in a light hearted, humourous way. I commend him for almost dying and laughing about it and then turning around and blaming it on old people. He is an inspiration for reckless young folk. Oh yeah, and the setting was a desert.	1	1		1																					
238	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� time setting very much affects the cyclist during the story. One of the things that affect him during the story is that it was a very hot, sun scorching day. Also he ran out of water and there was nothing but desert and poisonous snakes around. Another thing is that when he ran out of water there was no snakes warmers  just desert so he started to become very thirsty. In the essay it also said he reached a part where she saw a sign that said � Rough Road Ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limited, so the road conditions starting to get rough him that was another affect. In the end of the essay he reaches a camp where it is all peace and relaxed, and they have cold water there, this affects him because he feels replenished. All these different features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly.	2	2		2																					
243	3	The setting in the story greatly affected the cyclist. The main setting was that he was riding his bike in the desert. The desert is really hot so he needed more water than he would have if he were riding in the woods or if there was snow. Also there was hills on his travel that he had to ride his bike up which takes more  energy so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat, finally, because of the terrain he was riding on the animals he ran into, a snake, could have hurt him. Because the setting of the story was in the desert the cyclist was affected more then he had thought he would be.	2	2		2																					
244	3	In this paragraph I will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One affect was the uneven, bumpy roads he was trying  to cycle on. If it was flat he wouldn�t have to really be more aware, cause with bumpy roads he has to look out for rocks, holes in the road. Another affect are the hills. He had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat. Those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
246	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist in many was it was like a crazy maze, the road he was own, and him not really knowing were he was going didn�t help him, or not having enough water. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
249	3	"The cyclists problem in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by ""@PERSON1"" is dehydration and the California terrain is the cause. California is full of long deserts that can exceed @NUM1 degrees in sammer, and the cyclist was exerting himself so dehydration was inevitable. In the story the cyclist says �I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June� so the setting is obviously a hazard."	1	1		1																					
251	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the authour was not and augsosted and as she was ridding her bike there was no place for her to stop and fill up her water bottle.	1	1		1																					
252	3	The rode was deserted there wasn�t a builing, car, or house in sight. He was stuck andhes in the middle of nowhere without any water or food, poisonous snakes and the heat could made him collapse.	1	1		1																					
253	3	"The cyclist on her trips sees a lot of features that would discourage her. She is riding in high desserts of california in June"" (kurmaskie). We all know desserts are steaming hot and dry especially in june. She also encounters hills (kurmaskie) to make matters wose she was travelling on hills in the extreme heat.Though the cyclist goes through many perilous obstacles she makes it to a camp a lives I could seethe horizon, telling myself that I could make it that par, I'd be fine.""(kurmaskie) This shows the author's dedication and that if you don tgive up you will be fine."	2	2		2																					
254	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� the setting is an all- important factor. The author feels the need to describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details each place he stops, such as in �one ramshackle shed�and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule�� and �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite�� In a story such as this setting is of great importance especially since it is so rapidly changing. The story itself would be of much different quality likely for a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past, this story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is.	1	1		1																					
259	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned �@PERSON1�s Grape Juice� factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets �old timers and the give him a �shortcut� to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their �shortcut.� While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. �It din�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.	2	2		2																					
261	3	Setting is a very important element to the story �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit: by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative, for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1 the story would not be as interesting.	3	0		2																					
262	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting effects how fast, hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal. For example, ��Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist was going 12 mph, where the speed limit was 55 mph. The cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign, but he kept going. Furthermore, not only was the land add pressure to the cyclist. So does the heat from the sun. For instance, the cyclist says, �� and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke��. The heat begins to affect the authors health and his perseverance. The setting affect the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure.	2	3		3																					
264	3	It affect cyclest because the condition determines the pace and even how fast they could travel.	1	1		1																					
265	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration.	2	2		2																					
266	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example the tumbleweeds and the snakes. Being that its not out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
270	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hottnes of the deserts of California because the cyclist was sweating, and drinking his water bottles. Also when the cyclist saw the building, he thought he could rest and maybe get a ride to where he was going but, the building was abandoned years earlier so the cyclist couldn�t stop. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
271	3	Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources � especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,� was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. �I was going to die� he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder.	3	3		3																					
273	3	The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, affect the cyclist because the cyclist is in a desert with no water and trying to find a town there is further than he thinks. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This shows the cyclist did not have much confidens in this desolates area of the jerny.  	1	1		1																					
279	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by how much confidence in where he�s going and how he�s gona get there. Having no water	1	1		1																					
280	3	If the sun had not been so  blaring all the road so trecharous. Also the �devation� often bothers the author because he had to get over the dry and dehydrtion.	1	1		1																					
281	3	When cycling or doing any outdoor sport, the setting matters greatly. If its cold you need a jacket. Hot you need water. Depending on how secure it could be life or death. It could be realy hilly and you might get tired, and if you have no water you could die. Also it depends if its in a city burbed, small town, desert, highway all these factors play a huge roll in cycling	3	2		3																					
282	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in @CAPS1 ways. The cyclist was in California in June weather. If it wasn�t so hot, he wouldn�t have needed water as badly. He wouldn�t have been sweating as much. Also, there weren�t any buildings or cars around, so there wasn�t anyone to help him. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.� @CAPS1 features of the setting could affect the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
283	3	 In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is that he is cycling �through the high deserts of California in June�(Kurmaskie). This affect would mean that the author would be dehydrated faster. The cyclist, author, is dehydrated before he can make it to the next town because he �gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in [his] mouth�(Kurmaskie).	1	1		1																					
284	3	"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,�  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist. The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him.   "	3	2		3																					
285	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the @DATE1 then his water supply would�ve lasted longer and he would�ve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would�ve died. Luckily though it wasn�t and he was able to drink water.The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice something the cyclist could�nt do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him. Since I�ve fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy. 	3	3		3																					
286	3	"The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� @CAPS1 the cyclist's physical and mental state. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1�s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the �Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, �he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless� when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now �behind� him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist�s physical and mental state. Setting @CAPS1 the cyclist�s physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story."	3	3		3																					
287	3	"He setting made the cyclist feel lonely. The cyclist lost hope quickly because she was never saw any people or water on the way. The cyclist said they saw a �ghost town�. Before he got to the fish camp the cyclist saw no one and was becoming dehydrated. This caused him to lose hope and at some points he thought he was going to die. For example, he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It is clear that the setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way."	2	2		2																					
288	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was in a forest. This was a bumpy trip with a lot of troubles along the way. This was along trip. But he made it tough with a story to tell in the end.	1	1		1																					
289	3	The setting of the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.� It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on �the sun was beginning to beat down� He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. �I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. �The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on.	2	3		3																					
290	3	As the cyclist begins his journey, he is confident & exited to have been offered new directions from some �old wise men� which promise a shortcut. This water supply is mediocre & attitude willed against the flat and hilly terrain, untill he realizes the directions are way off  target. The cyclist was making his way to Yosemite when he came to the first �town� but it wasn't a town but more of a ghost dwelling. As he continued hoping the shortcut offered by the old �codgens� would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the hot desert wt a depleting water supply & dwindling spirit. He was disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men and through his his pain & dispair, encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt skrewed over, yet through his will & determination, by rationing water & mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physicall, emotional & mental trials and lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old � codgers� on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be out datted.	3	3		3																					
291	3	The whys  the  setting  affected  the  cyclist  is  that  the  hotter  it  was  the  more  water  that  he  drank.  Also the further he  travled  the  more  tired  he  got  which caused him to get hotter  and  which  caused  him  to  drink  more  of his water.	1	1		1																					
296	3	"During the cyclist journey he was faced with many ?? ??. Mostly the driver ?? and out of water. In the essay it says how he arrived at the first town and was in search for water. It said ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way. "	1	1		1																					
300	3	The setting explains an early summer evening with some eccentric men. The mood that he would be in would probably be lively. �Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice�� (Kurmaskie) says that if you were very lively, I would take that as a way of being drunk without being drunk, and doing whatever someone thinks you should do without knowing you are being persuaded to do it.	1	1		1																					
301	3	The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards. The weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough, but giving through a desert with limited water had to be miserable. The warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigue. This delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well. Not only did he have to through tough weather but hazardous condition too. There were times when �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�. This delayed him and took time to cycle around. As you can see this was a difficult journey for the reader and the affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
302	3	The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn�t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life.	3	3		3																					
305	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they figured that they were old enough and seen what was going on and been through that situation that they were well experienced and knew more about what was going on so the people should listen to them.	1	1		1																					
306	3	After the cyclist spoke to the �old timers who hadn�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,� his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and �tested like battery acid�. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and �ridiculously large snake� and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn�t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded.	3	3		3																					
314	3	During the cyclist�s trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the �shortcut� was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, � there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn�t anybody nearby to help him and there wasn�t any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie�s physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, � the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke� This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. 	3	2		3																					
317	3	The features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. The setting had a hot sun, no trees, and no water. The cyclist was also feeling lesy. In the story he said �I and the growing ??? :??? That I could drop from heat stroke.�	1	2		2																					
318	3	The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didn�t have enough space to carry a lot of water and rod to make portrons to drink. Also listening to old guys who didn�t know much didn�t help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel	0	0		0																					
326	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.	1	1		1																					
328	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because, it is hot, and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle, hot and dry with bad directions, and in a desert is bad. It was a long distance ride, in the burning hot sun, with little water, and he thought he was going to die because there was nothing insight. 	1	1		1																					
329	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one. For example in the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist had to endure going over big dirk hills while being dehydrated and tired from biking miles and miles to get to a destination. The setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up. The cyclist in the short story; started to lose hope until he found a store that sold fishing bait. The setting controls how long it takes you to getts your destination and how you get there. For example, if you come across a dirt road and theres a big boulder in the way, you have to find another way to get there. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways."	2	2		2																					
330	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says �wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.� The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign �Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it.	3	3		3																					
331	3	In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water. He also had to manuver around a snake. It made him tired and dehydratied. His muscles got sore from the rough terrain. He got dehydratied from the sun.	1	1		1																					
332	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because it�s almost like the background and theme of the cyclist The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. He�s showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much he�s indespair at the time. When he says �It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� In this quote he is saying that he @MONTH1 be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows he�s not in a good shape and he knows he�s in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do.	2	3		3																					
333	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert. The dessert is very hot. I know this because in the story, he states that it feels around @NUM1 degrees. He struggled for water but couldn�t find any that was cool. He found a water pump that had ""a tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This means it was hot and couldn�t find water."	2	2		2																					
334	3	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist. He starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men. The cyclist is very excited about the thought of a short cut and is drinking his water effectliy. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him. He take pressure in thinking about the cool stress of @CAPS1 and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictious stream had an effect on the cyclist. Soon the sun starts to beat on him even more. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage. When he come over the bend he cave to his troubles road and thirst	1	2		2																					
336	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist because if you are going down hil and then hit a rough road you not going to do so good. Like for example he had been going on flat land then it changed to hills lastly into rough road. These conditions could seriously hurt someone.	1	1		1																					
337	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.	1	2		2																					
343	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he could have tried  if he drunk the battery taste water. or if he didn�t get enough clean water on time. Driving a bike on in a long distance, with no water or any other supples is very energy consuming. So you have to plan trips like that very wisly.  	1	1		1																					
344	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the �beautiful @DATE1.� He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. But that�s not the worst of it. The hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker. There are also no places to stop for water. The cyclist is lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California.	2	2		2																					
346	3	There were many features that affect the cyclist. Lack of water slowed him down. Also the hills and sun were a big problem.	1	1		1																					
348	3	The way the features of the setting effect  the cyclist in what was, going through hot neighborhoods and very road that made her dehydrated and effected her journey including the long cycling which he had to go up.	1	1		1																					
351	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confidence, determination and relief. For example he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up. He first felt confident when the old people on the porch told him how to go and then at the end when he says he will listen to his map next time. He was also was determined because he wanted to get to the next town which he does, that also makes him relived, and wants to get to Yosemite National Park. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
353	3	The features of california and the fact that the cyclist was neave Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous to the cyclist california has a very hot climate, and is neove  a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater man if the had been cyclist in @LOCATION1. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to � short, rolling hills,� which would have made it harder to pedal, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mention how the sun was beating down on him, and that would alos serve as a factor thout helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problem the cyclist faced nowever, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through. Also, in the story you @MONTH1 notices that in the different stages of his struggle, the authours tone ananger from confidient , to unsure, to desser	3	3		3																					
354	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It made him tired thirsty and he was near exaustion.	3	2		3																					
355	3	The cyclist in the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to @CAPS1 national park. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The fist town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with dipleted water, @CAPS2 sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory. He had made it to a bait store for water at last. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again.	2	3		3																					
358	3	"The dry desert like setting would affect the cyclist because he could easily become dehydrated from the sun, and loss of water through sweat. The cyclist states, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state� (Rough Road Ahead). The man is badly dehydrated, but in his determination he moves on. The terrain went from being flat, to short rolling hills. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water. The man goes can to say, � I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me ""(Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviosly desert like, so it is dry, hot, and dusty. This would definately have an affect on his body which is sweating, which causes dehydration due to water loss. In conclusion the cyclist was greately affected by the setting."	3	2		3																					
359	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist quite durastrely. First of all, he was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� He was running out of water and the pump he found only produced.� brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. �and� had the flavor of battery acid.� Then he came upon �rolling  hills� and �Rough @CAPS1.� By the end, he was exausted, dehidrated, and in desperate need of water. The turain made the story more meaning full in proving that you souldn�t get directions from old guys. 	2	2		2																					
360	3	"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist encountered several problems. The main conflict of the cyclist in this text is the lack of water. Cycling is a vigorous exercise and can take much strength out of a rider. Water is neccesary to make sure the cyclist stays hydrated. In the text, the old men had the cyclist take a detour through desert areas and hilly terains. Because of the hot weather and rough roads the cyclist became dehydrated faster than normal. For  example, the text says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tentalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatsroke on a gorgeouse day in June."" @CAPS1, by usings vocubulary such as ""tentalizing"" expresses the cyclist need for water. Furthermore, later in the sentence the narrator make a reference to the old men, giving the blame entirely to them for them suggesting the path. Readers can also can conclude that the harsh setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist"	2	2		2																					
363	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. Their are many features that affected the cyclist. For example, �The sun was beginning to beat down.� they were starting to get hot, than tired. Than when he came to all the bumps in the road, It was harder to pedal. He was also drinking his bottle of water hard. So that means he's hot getting tired and lost �I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength� That is telling us he�s working too hard, than he�ll be worn out to ride. Those are reason's why features affected the cyclist. 	2	2		2																					
364	3	First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a �shortcut� that will take him right to his destination. Then the cyclist was faced with rough rolling hills of a highway. Over his long journey the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination.	1	1		1																					
367	3	The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says �have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office� gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite.	2	2		2																					
368	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclists in a big way because roads had bottles in then that could have caused him to get really hurt. Also, the water he was drinking was streaming and tasted like battery acid. Then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him. The setting was pretty baron for the cyclist because he also come across a snake. Last, he thought he saw some mirages that tells me that the climate is extreme for the cyclists. That�s how the setting affects the cyclists.	1	2		2																					
369	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he�s doing in weather that he could, �drop from heatstroke.� @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he�s seeing a mirage of a �building-abandoned years ealier.� The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in.	2	3		3																					
370	3	Throughout the story, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh tarrens of the midwest in his quest to find a source of water. He notes several times about the nice @DATE1, which ear him, quickly warms into sweltering heat as he pedals along. He also goes into detail about the change from flat ground to rolling hills on his journey. Behind these aspects make the use frol final much inorder  for the cyclist and gives the reader image as what he is going through.	1	1		1																					
371	3	In the article �Do not exceed the posted speed limit,� the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways. First off the whole Setting was a dry, dusty not desert that would chair anybody. �The sun was beginning to beat down, but i borely noticed it.� The own affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much, which bring me to the next point. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and i was traveling through the high deserts of california in June. This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory. This affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push more and more to reach water. In the end the feature of the setting only made him more determined to reach water.	3	3		3																					
372	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, One way was the weather. In the story it said �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (kermaskie @NUM1). Thats quote said he is in a desert and desert are usally warm. It also said in June and June is usally a hot temp month. The weath affected the cyclist because it was hot and he started to become dehydrated and had little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the souroundings. In the story it said. �There was no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind �(kurmaskie). That saying there know one around to help him so if he gets hurt or something. Also theres no where to get some water.	2	1		2																					
374	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says �I noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� This effects the cyclist because it makes him work harded when he is dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says�� in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting flustrated an there�s No cold water. This affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost. He didn�t have a good map.	2	2		2																					
376	3	IIn the essay the features of the cycleist affect the setting because the readers wouldnt have thought that he was in that bad of danger if he hadnt of been going through the desert. When the cyclist got to the grape factory he stated that he was almost dehydrated. And then when he got to the bait shop he drank from the faucet.	1	1		1																					
377	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by their were rolling hills that went up and down and it to alot of streanth and also he barely had water because, it was so hot he kept drinking and ran out of water early. In the story it say when he was riding that � He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down.� This quote shows it was starting to get hot. Also, in the story he says � I checked my water supply.� @CAPS1 means he�s starting to realize his waters running short. So in all the setting is hot abandoned and theirs no water source, so  the cyclist is being affected by all of this	2	2		2																					
381	3	The feachers of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. When she biked around a bend, �my troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me.�	1	1		1																					
384	3	I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain. Some types are not always good for a bike rider because if it�s bumpy then someone could fall off the bike. Also, if it is dark you @MONTH1 not even be able to see where you are going then you could hurt your-self very seriously. That�s why riding a bike is dangerous. Also, if your in the type of enviroment where every thing is smooth then you @MONTH1 be able to have a nice bike ride.  	1	1		1																					
385	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, �Do not Exceed posted speed Limit.� By changing him physically. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, �It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting."	3	2		3																					
386	3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He can�t say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him he�ll die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and that�s like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.	2	3		3																					
387	3	The features of setting affect the author because it moves him dehydrated. The dessert sun look sweat out of him and he had no water to bring that would replace his electrolites . Also, once the author had got into the hills he had lost a lot of his energy so peddling up his was a lot of work. If I were the author I would also have gotten tired because you need water in your body to survive.	1	2		2																					
388	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states �with strong legs and a smile on my face.� As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind�, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean� As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state.	3	3		3																					
389	3	In this story, �No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, by be Joe Kurmaskie I believe the setting greatly affect the cyclist. I believe this because when it�s long downhill cool roads is fine but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he can�t keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around so the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story. Another example	2	2		2																					
391	3	The setting is hot like desert, no one around, and very dry. Being hot outside affects the cyclist because he is sweaty and needs water. The heat wears him down. Having no one around causes him to not get water which he needs for his journey. These things make him week and makes it harder for him to find a place to get water.	1	1		1																					
392	3	The setting affect the cyclist because it could be a good or bad thing. If a cyclist adjust his own settings thats good but if somebody messe with them that could be bad.	0	0		0																					
393	3	"In this narritive of a cyclist, riding in california, and handed for Yosemite national park, he encounters a lack of water and bad directions from a group of old men on a pourch. The setting plays a big part in his ""challenge"", from the pine trees to the barren hills. In the begining of his trie he passes a ""gbost town"" that has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that, ""had my name written all over them."" This gives him hope and reassurance. Then the rusty pump and ""ramshackle shed."" They took the hope and reasurance away, making him cautrous. The hills that made him work hard to get over, the snake that slowed him down and the whelches juice company that was abundanded all didn't help and made matters worse. Then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better. It the setting has less the same the whole way he wouldn't have had any hope or he would have hope but it wouldn't fall and rise, making the story interenting.   "	3	3		3																					
395	3	"No water, and no direction effects the cyclist. Water effect cyclist because he said in the essay �I could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie). also no direction is another big one. It is important because without direction he is going to rideing for a long time. In conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story"	2	1		2																					
396	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thought he packed enough water so he began on his way he drank most of his water less than half way to his destination. He didn�t realize how hot it was until he got down to his last couple of sips of water. He started to become dehydrated he rembered the old men said that the next town was abait eighteen miles away so he kept on going when he reached the town there was nothing to drink just an old run down factory. He took same rocks and sucked on them, he went over a bump had swallowed it. He said to him self next time he would just go by what the map said everything he had gone past on the way had been run down and abandoned. Finaly he reached a bait shop and when inside the bathroom and got some water.	2	2		2																					
400	3	The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story the setting is a hot dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seems to start have an effect on him about after he reaches the first town. I know this by his statement.�This place might have been a thriving little spot at time �say, before the last war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chucked, checked my water supply and moved on. The the sun was beginning to beat down. The summer heat is thriving how during this @DATE1 and he is drinking lots of water.�So this setting does affect him greatly it causes him to use his water supply and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration. I know how the summer heat can affect you during @DATE1 activity �s. At times it feelslike you are going to die but that building is always around the bend just for the cyclist.  	3	2		3																					
403	3	"In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face� (@NUM1). This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� (@NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely reliefed to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever greatful. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water"	3	3		3																					
407	3	The features in the setting dramaticaly affect the cyclist. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in callada he woudn�t of dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned. An ironic twist �as he calls it. And the last one is hte bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions.	1	2		2																					
409	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story �who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office� also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welch�s factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain.	3	3		3																					
410	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 the heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.	3	2		3																					
415	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by helping him get water for his thirst. And getting back on the road to go where ever he is trying to go at. But the only thing is that he didn�t never say anything about getting his bait for the fish. Also, cyclist was all so affected because he almost died from thirst and no road.	1	1		1

418	3	When the cyclist first recieves directions to Yosemite Park from the �old timers� he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.  	3	3		3																					
419	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit.� The feautures of the of the area the cyclists rides through affect him greatly. For example when the narration says, �At some point, humble weeds crossed my path� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The tone of the cyclists from the quote above shows despare creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, �@CAPS1 hill, a building came into view� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist sounds more hopfull than before. That is how the area the cyclist enters affects him.	2	2		2																					
420	3	"In the story the cyclist is affect by many features of the desert. The main feature is the heat. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" He�s also running low on water,�The water bottles only contained & few tantalizing sips.� He�s faced by extrem heat and lack of water. He�s tired and has a long way to go. So far, all of the towns have been deserted. Finally he reaches a bait shop and his water and refills his water and promised to stick to the map in the future."	2	2		2																					
421	3	In the essay the setting affects the cyclist is different ways. For example, the couse must have been tough because he was dehydrated and it says that there are rolling hills and rough roads. Another example is there were dangerous animals like snakes that he came across. In conclusion, these are some reasons how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
425	3	I think it explains because they did good job but it was not good either because they did the right thing but they did same thing worng to.	0	0		0																					
427	3	"The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the ""heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. So in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could."	2	3		3																					
428	3	Some of the things that affect the cyclist was the lack of water. �The water, bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, water is a big importance. To stort men. Your body need water to work right. The @CAPS1 humid, dry weather of California was a affect To. �The high deserts of California in June.� �l could drop from a heatstroke.� The sun is unbearable, expessary without shade and water, @CAPS2 affect on the cyclist up. The have of animals � There was No- one in sight.� It would have been a lot easier for the cyclist if store or people would have been around, @CAPS2 exact is the animals. �A @CAPS3 large   snake crossed my path.� �diamondback- blocked the majoritly of the pavement. It would have been to worry about those things these are all things that affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
430	3	In the case of thr cyclist in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,� the setting has an enormous affecton the biker. Preclaminatly, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he �had been nitting my water bottles pretty regularly. �@CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, for the demonsrtrating just how much he needed water. The wate in this pump, the owner said, was, �somewhere in the neighbar had of two hundred degrees. If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, �ghost town� infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; �there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn�t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lose and acne.	3	3		3																					
431	3	There were many different conditions that effected the cyclist. He did not have the proper ammount of water for the journey witch made it difficult. He states in the story, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1 the terrain and hills made it difficult. He ran into snakes and very deserted country. But his determination led to success and arrived into a town	2	2		2																					
434	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you can�t see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.	1	1		1																					
435	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode. The cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured. The features of the setting also affect the cyclist because he has to go down steep hills and windy turns. In conclusion the features of the setting has a huge affect on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
438	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that they would drink up all of there water because it was hot and they would get ??  thirsty from all of that ???	1	1		1																					
439	3	In the essay intitled �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit� the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, �At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.� This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of �old-timers.� From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, �About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first �town�, a ghost town,� �The sun was beginning to heat down,� This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a �A Rough Road Ahead� sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood.	3	3		3																					
440	3	The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, ��@CAPS1 blues tune �summer time� rattled around in�my deteriorating brain.� The author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down. It�s also because there is very little water left for him. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it�s the author v.s nature. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, ��haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� The word has greatly changed. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. The towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author. 	2	2		2																					
442	3	The cyclist was riding on a rough bumby dangerous road. He had to be on the look out for animals that might try and nort or even kill him. Since he had no water he was de hydrating. Also the road was hot very well taken care of it took more energy to get through it.	1	1		1																					
443	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like hes coming or going on a vacation and because of the way hes riding it it seems hes going real fast as about to fall.	1	1		1																					
444	3	The cyclist is out in the desert there for was tired & also running out of water so hes getting dehydrated. 	1	1		1																					
446	3	The features of the setting in this story, �Do not exceed Posted Speed limit,� affect the cyclist in a huge way. The cyclist was biking through California in a desert-like area. It can get very hot there,like the writer describes, �wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.� The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed.  	2	2		2																					
447	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist. �I maneuvered down the hill.� This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would hawe been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy. If there werent anyhills to get in his way.	2	1		2																					
448	3	"The setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills. These factors greatly effected the cyclist. The hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply.The text says, �The sun was beginning to beat down� (@NUM1). Showing the temperature was rising.  The text says, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (@NUM2). The author�s battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills. Seems like everything went wrong for this man but he still made it."	1	2		2																					
449	3	"In the start story �Do not exceed speed limit,� time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of california in June. The fact that the story took place in June (and especially in a California desert) really is what caused the cyclist�s dehydration. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual. This heat cause the dehydration and the ""growing realization that I (the author)"	1	1		1																					
453	3	The setting in the story affect the cyclist alot. It is June in the California desert. The sun is heating down on him. Another problem that he faces is that there is a very rough terrain. All of this together makes him drink up his water even faster. The setting is making him feel very disprate when is even worse.	1	1		1																					
455	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist more tired and thirsty. The rolling hills where he had to pedal up and down and the desert with no water in sight just dry land. Everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story. The old Welch�s Grape Juice Factory,is like drinks are right there but are now gone. If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he would�ve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings. The tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died. Everything in the story was the opposite of what he wanted until he got to his last hope the bait shop.	2	1		2																					
456	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us ��I was travelling through the high deserts of California  in June.� The extreme heat of the summer definitely put a  strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water . Unfortonatly the  �towns� were very far apart and many not having good water making dehydration  problem. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.� @CAPS1 of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map.	2	2		2																					
459	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in the high deserts of California where it is very hot so, you need alot of water. Then he needs more water and finds a water pump but cant use the water because it was �some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" Then the terrain in changes when he says �Flat road was replaced "	1	2		2																					
460	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because I was talking about the exceed posted speed limit. How the speed limit or were it says �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. They are trying to say is that, you do what they say you are going to be mesem peoples travel will not work, so make the right choice and do the right thing.	1	1		1																					
461	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by that he or she should behave act or talk according to the settings. It means that where ever they are existing and whatever it looks like, they need to fit them self in. They also need to fit the mood according to where they are located. The cyclist is feeling comfortable according to the story and he dosent need any change in setting or location. For conclusion the features of the setting affects the cyclist by that he needs to make improvment and changes according to where he or she is located. 	1	1		1																					
462	3	In the beginning the cyclist was ready to go and happy. By the time he got half way there he was �losing hope�. It was very hot and he was simple alone. By the end, he was relieved because not only did he find water, he found an easier way to get to Yosemite. The first old group of men didn�t help, but the second man did.	1	1		1																					
464	3	In this story it seems as if everything is dry. The rider would be getting real thirsty. He is all by himself that would make any man feel strong, because if you have an ascedent that nobody would be there to help. Hes going up and down steep hills so he would have to be careful.	1	1		1																					
468	3	The hot day in June riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experence has made him stronger.	2	3		3																					
470	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and he was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the �ghost town� and bait shop he says, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story. 	2	2		2																					
471	3	It think  it means  to be all you can be.	0	0		0																					
472	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3. 	2	2		2																					
473	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to become dehidrated and start to lose conciousness. For ex. the town he was suposed to comue to was just an abandoned factory and he had to travlle another @NUM1 miles or so with no water.	1	1		1																					
476	3	The cyclist in the story is @CAPS1 affected by the fatause of setting in the story. The Hill afected him becaus they have harder to get over.	2	2		2																					
477	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town. ""This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on. "	2	3		3																					
478	3	The setting affect the cyclist in alot of ways one way is that if you dont know where your going you could get hurt. Also is if the road condition are very bad. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
479	3	In this essay features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite makes it worse. Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn�t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn�t have water he couldn�t funcation as well as if he was hydrated.	2	2		2																					
482	3	"In the @CAPS1 ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit"" many ways affect the cyclist. Three of those things are heat, lack of water, mud its anything town. The heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired. For example the text states."" I could die form a heatstroke on a gergeous day in June."" this shows that it was extremly hot. The cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty. For example it states in the text."" I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water. The last way the setting affects the cyclist is when he goes into a town and tieds it empty. The text states,"" on that morning it fit the traditional detinition at a ghost town."" This show that he expected it to be there so he could rest but it wasn't like it was appare to be things all show how the setting affected th cyclist."	2	2		2																					
483	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a couple of ways. The first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert. This caused him to sweat badly and get very dehydrated. The seconded way was that there were rough roads and hilly snotts this made him more tired faster. In conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit.	2	2		2																					
485	3	Many things on the cyclist journey affected him. It was in the middle of summer in California. The heat is unbeleivable and rediculously hot. �� I could drop from heatstroke�� he was so bad overheated and dyhdrated that he could of died any minute. He could have also been killed by a giant snake. ��look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement�� It could have easily killed him, if he wasn�t careful. But with his determination and spite he pulled threw and made it to a fresh supply of water. If he would have gaven up his life would have been over.	3	3		3																					
490	3	The setting is the main factor on effects on the cycleist. The cycleist�s main problem is that he is low on water & dehydrated, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� The author wouldn�t have been so dehydrated if it weren�t so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake & the rough road. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldn�t have been any conflicts.	2	2		2																					
491	3	In the story the cyclist is afected by setting because in the @NUM1 paragraph it talks about him seeing the old water pump and how he was trying to get water out. At the end of the story he gets angry when he sees the old welches juice factory because he relizes that the old men didn�t know what they were talking about. Also at the end he is realived when he finds Gary and @ORGANIZATION1 because there is water there. 	1	1		1																					
492	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him� no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclution of the setting, having only seen �One ramshackle shed in many miles, the cyclist almost looses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of �the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.� That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope.	2	2		2																					
494	3	In the essay �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, �cool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.�The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, �One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest Mule greet me.�there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried. The last example was, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well. As his route ends he comes across in manymore aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability.	3	3		3																					
496	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn�t even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. �The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.� (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.	2	2		2																					
499	3	On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their direction aren�t so good. The desserted place affected him because there was no where for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. There were rusted water pump�s, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration.	2	2		2																					
500	3	The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� @CAPS1 to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn�t find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another.	3	3		3																					
503	3	It affected him by dehydrating him and wearing him down to the point where he was about to give up. But he never gave up. As the end sartisfaction came out of it all.	1	1		1																					
504	3	The trees were in the landscape and it was making the colors red and the volcanoes and the tall pine trees covered were in the landscape and milker years ago it make the swampland became the desert	1	1		1																					
507	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, �I arrived at the first �Town��this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time�but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, �short, rolling hills� (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn�t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist�s journey in a negative way.	3	3		3																					
508	3	In the story, �Rough Road Ahead�, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the setting. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert like area, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through.	2	2		2																					
514	3	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts olwing the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water decive his trip, but he was mistaken. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The setting affected the cyclist�s mood in a negative way.  	2	2		2																					
516	3	Many things caneffect a cyclist and how they ride, in this essay many things effected him such as the setting of the story. One of the problems of the setting was there were no stores or even people, another and most important thing was the lack of water around him, so many things can effect a cyclist while They are riding inculding there suriondings.	2	3		3																					
518	3	Condition the cyclist is in affect a lot of how they ride. One example of this is, �I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.� @CAPS1 to this fact the cyclist had went into a �dehydrated state� because of not having much water. When your travelling in hot weather areas without much water your body will become dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists diffently.	1	1		1																					
520	3	In the story �Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being hott affected him because it mad him more thirsty. Than him being out in the middle of the desert made it so he couldn�t get any water. The hills made him tired and weak. All of the features in the setting had an affect on him, which made him powerless and thirsty.	1	2		2																					
523	3	The setting of the place was �ghost town� as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldn�t ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of new world because they told him the wrong directions.	1	1		1																					
525	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe @PERSON1 it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the problems he faced. For example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story it said �Drop from heatstroke.� this shows the setting affected him in a negative way, in the story heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character.	2	1		2																					
526	3	The features of the setting affected the author�s story a lot. It affected it by making the trip seem more difficult to the reader. This was made possible by telling how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says �over one long, crippling hill.� This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills. But if the road wasn�t as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult. This would also make it as if that the old guys gave good directions. But the whole point.	1	1		1																					
528	3	The setting affects alot in a cyclist. For example if you are in a city you seel rush tired and everweled. But in a forest you are happy and a bit less stress. A setting sets the mode also the attude in the story.	1	1		1																					
530	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist�s own words, � things began well enough.� @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, �got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.� He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him.	2	2		2																					
532	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid.Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
534	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can�t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can�t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn�t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink.	2	3		3																					
536	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily .On top of that he had to pedal a bicicle. So he was thirsty and tired prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
539	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike the roads also would make him work harder.	1	1		1																					
540	3	The features of the setting affected the cycalist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didn�t know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
543	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water. The ghost town doesn�t help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abanded. This is how the features affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
549	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. In the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. Also because he was in the desert he had no sense of direction. Also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn�t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water.	2	2		2																					
553	3	I read �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� written by Joe Kurmaskie in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by accepting advice from �old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches @CAPS1 was in office�	1	1		1																					
554	3	In the essay �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states �The sun was beginning to beat down,� @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says �@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states �dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting.	2	3		3																					
555	3	The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist. For example.� I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� The deserts of California especially in June are hot and dry and caused the cyclist to use much of his water supply, very quickly. As he �toiled� on, the terrain features became even more trying,� over one long, crippling hill��By this time the cyclist barely had enough energy to make it over a hill from all the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting.	2	2		2																					
558	3	Heat, water supply, energy-all are features of setting that can affect a cyclist. First, is heat. When it is too warm out it makes it more difficult, and more inconvenient to ride. Second, is your water supply. If you are riding, and begin to run low on water, your in trouble. The author describes, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips�. If you arn�t prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Lastly, is energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. �With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� the author describes. When you are out of energy, your ride is over. all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey.	2	2		2																					
561	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the hills made it hard for him to ride his bike up and he was afraid of the grass becase it was tall and scary looking.	1	1		1																					
564	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit� the features of the setting affects the cyclist a great deal. Each feature causing the cyclist to act. For example, in reaching the �ramshackle shed� the cyclist finds the water inusuable; which causes to conserve water and try to head for the next town. That action leads him deeper into the high deserts of California during June. Also as the terrain changes from flat road to short, rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every �shack or building he comes across for water. In this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot.	2	2		2																					
567	3	The cyclist is in the desert which @NUM1 degrees with water that tastes like the battery acid. The desert makes him see the mirages having sweat get into his eyes. In the story  �Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie 	1	1		1																					
569	3	He�s on a very hot climate, in a desert, so he needs lots of water, but he has a limited supply. He�s riding on hills, which makes it even harder. He can�t find any towns that aren�t abandoned.	2	2		2																					
570	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him was time because of the road he had to go slower so took him longer to get to the town. Also because the road was harder to peddle on he got thristy and the water was really hot.	1	1		1																					
574	3	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place things change No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist. Never travel advice home old-timers who haven�th confines of use porches.Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit.	1	1		1																					
577	3	A response that explains how the features of setting affect the cyclist by getting wrong dirachion The old man. One features when tough an ghost town. The old people in the didn�t know they were tell him. It made it haede for nam because that more harder roads and lesort water. He almost died.	1	1		1																					
578	3	The features of the setting will affect the cyclist because the roads are hilly and he is old so it will be hard for him to ride up them. It was very hot and he had a scares supply of water. He was seeing things that wasn�t there. When he did try to get some water, the weather was so hot that the water from the pump came out hot.	1	1		1																					
579	3	Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking to much of his water. So when he stoped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water their. He started his ride the the roads were hilly and short. Then the road turned into bumpy to. So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way. 	1	1		1																					
581	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance the desert is not a hummid making is lack of water a bigger deal than normal. Also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal. In conclusion I temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.	2	2		2																					
582	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by never accept travel advice from colletion of old timer who haven�t left there porches since carter was in office. After that because you don�t know if they are real collection or what. After because some people have not left there porches since carter was in office. I don�t know why people have not left there porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
583	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot, him not having anything to drink, nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages. In the essay it states, �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.� This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding enviroment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasen�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. �The cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one.	2	2		2																					
584	3	In �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie: c, I think that e the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and he thought he was going to die In this case he had no water left and he was in the desert. He was regreating not taking the advice of the stranger and was dieing of thirst. Also he dident have the mind set that he wanted to live. Thats how I think the setting affectd him.    	1	1		1																					
586	3	Nature has an affect on everyone, even when they don�t think it does. Expecially for cyclist traveling anywhere or everywhere. In �Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example about settings laffect people like cyclist. When you�re riding your bike as actually cross country transportation, you have to know what your doing and where you�re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route for a cyclist because at these �town� they had no water, because they weren�t towns to begin with, not anymore atleast. If you don�t have any water like this guy did hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example.� l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth. I�d read once that sucking on stones help take your mind off thrist� This guy knew a little bit of survival tips. If he�d gone all that way without standing up yo his thrist and those hills, he probably would have had some kind of stroke. That is just a few way that setting could harm you.  	3	3		3																					
588	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the �town� The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, ��I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, �Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp�� (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   	3	2		3																					
589	3	In the story Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the features had a more negative affect on the cyclist. The cyclist got tired because of the big hills and he liked the scene which was they only good that if had on hon. �The water bottle only contained a few tantallizg sips.� he didnt have enough water and he was thirsty. �At some point a rediculously large  snak it really did look like dimond back�bloked the majority of the pavement.� It is dangerous where he was riding and even though he was on a bike he could have been bit. All of these points I made showed the negative affect.	1	1		1																					
590	3	The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn�t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff	1	1		1																					
593	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. �I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.� All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.	2	2		2																					
594	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off. It caused him to go dehiderated because lack of water and he went kind of dilerious. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was un drinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree. Lastly, the Welch�s factory that he came across was teasing him in in the way that he couldn�t have the liquids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch�s juice. Not only did the cyclist get off track because the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable.	3	2		3																					
596	3	The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the dessert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1. In conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which affects his entire journey.	3	2		3																					
597	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren�t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat.	2	2		2																					
600	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self- determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths inorder to reach their destination.For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are based to reach some rough spots where it seems you can�t walk. But that is where self�determination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there @MONTH1 be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip, when you don�t have the right provision to keep you self energised you can �t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything.This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
604	3	Some features of the setting affected the cyclist. The rolling hills, poisonous snake, and the conditions of the road worried her. For example, @CAPS1 said, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary.� @CAPS1 had high doubt when saying that quote. @CAPS1 didn't think @CAPS1 would ever make it. Finally, @CAPS1 reached another destination and again finding herself asking another older man for directions!	2	2		2																					
607	3	When the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence. He biked to the first town but it was like a �ghost town.� A town is a town. soon after that, he did not see anything. No cars, buildings, or anything. He was getting sad and dehydrated. The old men swore there was a town coming up so he put his trust and confidence in him once again. He saw a building  coming up, but it was just an old wore down factory. He thought he was let down. He was sure he was going to die, right there right now. He than saw a siga for a fish comp! He was overjoyed! The place was real to! He thought of them as his savior! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously.	1	2		2																					
608	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie there were many settings that affect the cyclist. One example would be when he came up to a water pump and he tried to get water out but water didn�t come out. ��working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out�.� (Kurmaskie). Another example is when he came across rolling hills, and the scaring heat, he also came across a snake that took up most of the pavement.	1	1		1																					
610	3	The setting in the story was hot. The biker was sweating a lot. The whole town was empty. He pasted empty buildings. Their were rivers and big hills that he had to ride through. As it says about the buildings, �somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� The setting would affect the cyclist because their was no one in the town. Also, their was high hills.	1	1		1																					
611	3	The feature of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. He was a California desert in the month of June. There was no water in the desert so he had to use the water he had. He says the sun began taking harder ran and the terrain turned into short rolling hills. The hills made him work harder which dehydrate him guccher.and since there was no water in the desert, he could have died of dehydration	2	2		2																					
613	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. �A rediculously large snake� this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.� I could drop from heat stroke� another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.� There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.� The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.� This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
616	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because. It was a lack of the water and he was in the high deserts or California .For example in the text stated �when I tried a drop or two, it  had the flovor of battery acid. That showed clearly when he tried to get water from a pump what it clearly came out as the settling was extremely hot and made the cyclist misreable in such ways.	1	1		1																					
619	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they made the simplist challenges for him. The back of water and the snake in his path are examples.	1	1		1																					
622	3	Through most the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way. For instance, he makes it to this town a guy swore was there, but it turned out to be abandoned. So he let out a sad, hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, so he hung his head and that blues tune �summer time� rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst. So he stuck some pepples in his mouth to take his mind off it. Then he thought about how lucky he�d be if he checked, @CAPS1 negative to me.	2	2		2																					
623	3	The features from the essay affect the cyclist in many was because he is getting field, and is drinking more and more water. The raods are getting rough so he needs to slow down. If he slows down he will get tierd and need more water although he is all out on top of that the old men really didnt know what they were talking about the features affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
626	3	The setting affects the cyclist. He starts to see things that will affect his mind. Passing there is rolling around him he starts to feel abandoned and misled because there are no signs is going to right way.	1	1		1																					
629	3	The features of this setting effect the author while he is cycling. They changed his hope to doubt. There were no buildings or cars, which led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water. Im sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just civilization, then the cyclist would of been fine.	1	2		2																					
630	3	Blazing tempitures, lack of water, dwinding hope-all are the parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. Blazing tempitures, because the hotter the water was the more perspiration and lack of hydration was appointment you can�t put anything back in your skin and your body can�t function without water finally dwinding . Hope, the cyclist didn�t think he was going to live through this. He tried hard and pushed himself and success was made. He lived.	2	2		2																					
634	3	The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water. There are obsticles in the road too, such as, the big snake laying across the middle of the road. He is lost without water and could possibly die of an heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
636	3	The cyclist and his journey in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit were impacted by the setting. The �deserts of California in June� caused him to be weary very easily. The terrain change from the flat road to hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT Exceed 55 mph. He could only go @NUM1. Finally, the large snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist. All of these features affected the cyclist in some way.	3	2		3																					
638	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The temperature in the area affect the way he drinks his water which leads him to thinking he is going to die because he is running out of water. The �towns� he comes to are so deserted he thinks he is going in the wrong direction. All the settings in the story also help him not to give up but keep on going. In conclusion even though he had to go through all that doubt he was going to be alive in the end he still went on and tried. In the end he did make it and all it was worth it.	2	2		2																					
641	3	The features affects the setting of the cyclist because in some ways they through you off a little with others lines and then will get confused of what their acually talking about. The littlest thing that could through you off is the line when it says before the last world war. That kind off through me off alittle.	1	1		1																					
642	3	"The setting that were affecting the cyclist was the lack of water he had because it says �the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" and the text also says "" I�ld read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate� he wouldn�t be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasn�t thirsty."	1	1		1																					
643	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldn�t find any building or water for many miles. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didn�t know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
645	3	"The features of the setting make him happy because he meets some people that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip. This is what the text says, �what I shouldn�t have done was let them have a peck at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a �shortcut� that was to slice away hours from my ride."" He also talks about not talking directions from old timers. This is when the text says,�"	1	1		1																					
647	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, he was in the california desert in June.The heat and lack of water can cause people to become dehydrated,passout or even die.There are not many sources of water in the deserts.The terrain didn�t help him much either, hills use a lot of energy and  made him perspore,causing him to lose flood from his body. The cyclist was greatly affected by the features of the setting.	2	2		2																					
648	3	The rider in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider �rode into the morning...with a smile� because of the bright sun, and the �cool pines� and rushing rivers�...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the �ramshackle shed...� And the �...sight of this was troubling...� to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the �crippling hills� that maybe this wasn�t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the �modern bathroom� that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through.	2	2		2																					
650	3	At first the trip was easy going and flat. It was a nice day out and the water sapply was draining. Soon, the path became hills and soon got rough. Even though the pines gave shade it wasn�t enough to help the cyclist. Eventually he reached some what civilization after enduring a grueling climb and by cycle trip through the woods.	1	1		1																					
652	3	Setting that affected the cyclist was water tempeter, rolling hills and condition of the roads. Water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started pumping the water it was hot but he took it he tried to let it cool down but it didn�t. Rolling hills was another a tender to the cyclist hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up his can strain the leg and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition, it was smooth at frist then it became rough and rocky. Those was some affects the cyclist had to over come	2	2		2																					
654	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.   "	3	3		3																					
656	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The hills afected the cyclist because they would be harder for him to ride The abandoned town also affected him. When he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break but when he got there the town was abandoned. Also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on. Also there was nowhere that he could get water around him. Many features of the setting affected him.	2	2		2																					
658	3	The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he�s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a �ghost town� where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn�t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It�s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn�t find water yet. It doesn�t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosen�t find water.	2	3		3																					
659	3	The setting in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was based in the hot, and dry terrain of California. This setting affected the character mood. It did this because some of its included feature can seem as actual metaphorically based moods. An example from the story is, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite...� this quote from the story could suggest the tone and the mood of the scenery which would be calm, and relaxed. So from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood.	2	2		2																					
660	3	The features of the setting that affect cyclist depends where they are located. In this story the feeling on �nothing and the desert around him and the heat gave him no hope�. It all depends on where you are cycling. �It didn�t really matter I was going to die.� This quote states his feelings on what was going on through his head while he was dieing of thirst. He felt nothing he was sure he was going to die until he found a sign of civilization that was near and he became better and his hope was raised.	2	2		2																					
661	3	I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being a long, hot, lonely ride there, had an effect on him. It scared him which made him go longer. He had nothing to drink and thought he was going to die it made him weak. The snake in the way caused him longer and every stop that had once there effected him to.	1	1		1																					
662	3	I would think even riding a bike for so long can be bad for the behind. But also good exercising especially for the legs all the strength you get from the muscle. To know where you going could take forever. But I do know what they would have to face all types of weather, but as long as you have gear on no harm could come to you.	1	1		1																					
664	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, �Sometimes life can be so cruel�. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He�s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
666	3	The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. It is an extremely hot now in California while the narrator in aiding his ride. This causes him to become delighted much faster while he is on a �Short hit� leading to no where. �Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from ?? a gorgeous day in June� This gust shows how that calm day really was and the fact the cyclist is sweating so much shows how much the weather is affecting him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling towards up and down no often, it secured his journey. It cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water.The deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply.	2	3		3																					
669	3	Each time the author comes to a point where the setting isn�t very appealing or helpful, he loses hope for reaching his destination or finding a nice place to rest and get some fresh water. For example, the text states, �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point. This shows that he�s getting frustrated and losing some hope. He also mentions that the �sight was troubling� which shows how big of an affect the features around him or scenery can have.	2	2		2																					
670	3	Lots of features in the setting play an affect on cyclist. Some that @MONTH1 play an affect are the heat, flat road that�s had to ride on, or how there	1	1		1																					
672	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all he is travelling through a desert in California in June so the weather is extremely hot and the cyclist needs water, however as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water himself so he is thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, if frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot it tastes like battery acid @CAPS1, when the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, but there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, that the cyclist cannot go more that 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town. he still will have to wait longer for the much needed water, travelling at 12 mph. The snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape. Thus his major concern is the lack of water.	3	3		3																					
673	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. At first it was a bright shiny day and the cyclist was happy. He reaches the first town which is a ghost town and it makes him sad. Riding on he begins to lose water. The once bright shiny day began to beat the heat down on the cyclist. He reached a ramshackle shed and began to lose hope. He loses water quickly and becomes more dehydrated. The terrain become slopes and hills and the ride become harder, when he reached the grape drink factory his hopes were almost gone. But just over the hill was a fishing shop. He used his reining energy to speed down the hill to get water and get his energy back. 	1	1		1																					
674	3	"The features of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when it says, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.� The features of this setting are making the cyclist determined. Another example, is when it says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" The features of the setting are making him brave and couragious. The last example is when it says, �I hung my head.� The features of this setting are making the cyclist have despair. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
676	3	The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men who�s information was not accurate. Then he cycled along the desert which was very hot. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way. He almost had a heat stroke a few times. He was probably angry that he took these men�s advice and got himself into this. Then when he found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So it�s really confusing because he probably felt relived and mad at the same time. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn�t, the old man would have gave him some more messed up direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke.	3	2		3																					
677	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by rush he /she got when speeding down the hill. The fresh morning air, no limits just you and your feet. Speeding, going as fast as you can with your heart pounding in your chest. No boundarys, when you can go where you like, when you like. No people to get in the way of you and your need for speed.	0	0		0																					
679	3	�@CAPS1 directions, June, lack of water� all are elements that effect the rider on his ride. He took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut. I turned out that their short cut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California. It would have been burning hot. Lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip. He could have died if he didn�t find the other water source. These were some elements that effected the rider on his trip.	2	2		2																					
680	3	The feature of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The features in the story changed the speaker�s mood throughout his journey. For example, in the beginning he came across a deserted town so he was cautious. Next, he came across a fork in the road which was troubling to him. Then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined. Finally, his determination changed to relief where he reached Gary and Wilber�s fish camp. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey.	2	2		2																					
682	3	In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,�The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.� In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I�d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.� This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn�t care if he died. From the author�s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
684	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all, if the cyclist didn�t listen to the old man, he would have never gone through this trouble. Also being that he didn�t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own.	1	2		2																					
685	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist .The setting makes him feel thirsty, dry, hot, and lost. In the story the setting plays a big party in the cyclist's will to ride to the next town. First the cyclist asks directions from a guy that never left his house in decades this creates, doubt. Also in the story it says �Tumbleweeds cross my path� this makes the cyclists feel lost. Finally it say the �water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This makes the cyclist thirsty and tired. The features definatly have an effect on the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
686	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways. He was biking in the middle of the summer in a very hot state of California. This affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated. The roads are very hilly so, he has to use alot more energy to get up the hills. That�s why I think the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed.�   	2	1		2																					
689	3	The cyclist had alot of problems with his setting. It was very hot and he started getting low on water. This caused him to become dehydrated. There was hardly any civilization so no one could come to his aid. Also, the path he decided to take was long and vigorous.	1	1		1																					
693	3	Varias faetures of the setting affect the journey and mooble if the cyclist in the text. The first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the desert. He is �traveling through the high deserts of California in June� , and this is making him really thirsty. �[He] had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly �because of this. He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless. He becomes hopelee because there is no building or establishments anywere in sight. Therefore no water and there isn�t a place to get any water. Another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions. They told him abait a shoutcut, and he listened. This through everything off, and he was left with despair. Another feature is the Gary and Wilber�s fish camp.This lead him to sicocss of finding water. This affected his mood because he had hope again. In conlusio, many of the features of the setting affected his mood in many ways.	2	3		3																					
696	3	"In �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist by making him doubtfull. The cyclist is doubtfull that he won�t make it to Yosemite National Park. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.� This shows how he is doubtful. Finally in the story the cyclist doesn�t think that they will make it."	2	2		2																					
699	3	The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? � It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�� The heat must have been bad, he wasn�t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men �helping� with directions.	2	2		2																					
700	3	As he began his journey, he had full confidence in the directions given given to him by the old men. After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on. After he found an �ramshackle shed� he became troubled , as he �had been �hitting� his �water bottles regularly� and was traveling through the �desert of California in June� and was running low on water. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he �manuevered� his way down, only to find it long  deserted and himself close to despair. He was desparate for water he needed it soon. Finally, he came upon �@CAPS1 and Wilber�s Fish Camp� and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on  he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling.	2	2		2																					
701	3	The features of the setting in the story �DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn�t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting�s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story.	2	3		3																					
703	3	"The lone biker in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.�The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,� in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. �I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.� The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey."	3	3		3																					
704	3	Dry, thirsty, tedious-all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, everything is dry. The cyclist isnt any where near a town that could help him. He has been pedaling in the heat, outside for a long time. Secondly, He is very thirsty. The way he is travelling is a good sign he is in need of water. He went fourty miles before he reached the first town to stop at. He also is on a bike, So that doesn�t leave him much room to carry water along. Lastly, the trip is tedious. He has been going for forty miles, and the speed limit is 55. He hasn�t acceded 12 mph. All to gether, the cyclists trip seems to be adventure that takes a lot of heart.	1	1		1																					
706	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was very hot and he didn�t have any more water also, there aren�t any towns that had good water in them, until he eventually arrived at this fishing comp. Due to his lack of water, he became dehydrated and really weak. �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� this quote shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and losing his energy.	1	2		2																					
707	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.	2	3		3																					
708	3	The setting from the story left the cyclist in a mental way because most of the time the sun was on his mind due to the fact that he was pedaling hard in a hot summer day in June. The cyclist had very little water and with him biking under a beating sun wasn�t exactly helping him. He  had to like disasterous events like, peddling slopes than the normal speed, a snake blocking the path, old men telling to take a different route then be infected, and the fact that his water supply was low made him think he was going to pass out under the burning sun. However his determination was strong as he continued on pedaling through and he eventually found himself in another town but this time with people, fish and water.	2	2		2																					
710	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the hot sun makes the cyclist dehydrated and since there is no water sources around the cyclist is not getting any water. The rough terrain makes the cyclist tired.	1	1		1																					
711	3	Many features of the carlifonian desert influenced the cyclist during his ride.Ghost towns, rolling hills, and dangerous snakes influenced the cyclists experience during the''shortcut'' to yosenite.The Ghost towns along the journey syndized the world desrting him during his ride by offering no help with water supply as a place to cool dowdn.The road sign warning of rough terrain was another barrier on his bike ride that he had to get through in dehydration to reach his goal,yosenite.The diamondback rattlesnate caused additional horror to the cyclist's'' ride from hell''.He had to manuever around the serpent while unstable from dehydration.All features of the cyclist's riding setting affected his ride to yosenite.	3	2		3																					
713	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can�t go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he�s relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn�t really know where he was going because there wasn�t a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first �town� as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and he�s only 12 he knows that he�s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
714	3	"The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affects the cyclist in many ways. First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men who�s directions were out of date. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways. "	2	2		2																					
717	3	"It can�t be known as, ""easy"" to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well. The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn to a semi brutal experience �it got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, �This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration. It lead: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT @CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT.�This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the  cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. �at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS2, this quote show of some of the dangers the  cyclist encountered. If  these features did not appear, then maybe the story would be describing a nice bike ride, but once you read about them, it becomes more of a disaster."	3	3		3																					
719	3	Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate. And the long flat roads are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go but as straight roads turn into hills it shows that there is a change in the journey and something better is about to happen.	2	2		2																					
720	3	"The setting affect is used to a great extent in the short story �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� The cycleist had beed going for a very long time when he came to the first town and there was no water At this point you can tell that he has lost confidence the �old timers"" directions. From this quote; �a ton-like substance oozed out.� This quote shows how after @NUM1 miles of pedaling when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point his one chance of water had been depleated. The next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out. He said, �I hung my head� this shows how he almost completely lost all hope and that he was sure that he is going to die."	3	3		3																					
722	3	During the cyclist�s biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town This sight doesn�t immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain. Eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief. As evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence.	3	2		3																					
723	3	The setting effects the rider because if it�s hot you get thirsty and you have no water.This kind of question is hard to answer	1	1		1																					
724	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the journey more dangerous and difficult. For example, in the reading it states that rediculously large, poisonous diamond back snakes. Blocked majority of the pavement. So, the cyclist had to keep his/her balance to ease past them. The terrian also changed into short, rolling hills, making it even more difficult. 	1	1		1																					
727	3	The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront  nature. when he began his trip with advice from �old coggers� he � rode out with strong legs and a smile.� As he came to the first town, he describes it as a �ghost town� having no water and no human contact for some time. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rods on. Through the miles he incountered a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps, snakes,and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his �inner spirit� and caused his dehydration to further. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation.	2	2		2																					
728	3	The harsh features at the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along �The high deserts of California in June�, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small �gost towns� rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as �Short rolling hills� through ghost the terrain and ever a snake. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey etc.	2	3		3																					
729	3	Cycling is a very good sport people who do cycling are in shape. Also they have strong calve muscles. I think its also dangerous as well.	1	1		1																					
730	3	In the story the author says, �The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,� This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, �with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.� The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water.	2	2		2																					
732	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldn�t get water from anywhere because he was in a dessert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty camps. Second, there were short rolling hills, and rough roads which made it hard to ride on. There were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes. The heat made it hard to keep riding. And there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
733	3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness.	3	3		3																					
735	3	The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as �the sun was beating down� and �high deserts of California in June� to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says �short rolling hills�, �tumbleweeds� and �long, crippling hill� to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower.  Finally, the cyclist is faced with a �rediculously large snake� and plants and weeds which get in his way and force him to slow down.	2	2		2																					
737	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead� plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn�t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see�s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn�t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. �Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.� @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her."	3	3		3																					
738	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness. When the cyclist got directions to Yosemite from these two ??? old people, he thought he was getting a good shortcut. In reality, he was just led on a road that seemed to head nowhere where he saw many things that added to his feeling of hopelessness, for example, the author writes, � I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds crossed my path and an adversely large snake. It really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This shows that the cyclist is getting tired and seeing tumbleweeds, which usually represents a phase being completely deserted and deadly snakes that get in his way. This answers the question because it shows how the setting leads to his feeling of hopelessness."	2	2		2																					
742	3	In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite. If the setting wouldn't have been so bad, the long ride wouldnt have been as hard on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a California desert, when he did find a well he said, � followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. � @CAPS1 thing about the setting is, if it wouldnt have been so hot, he wouldnt have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said �  I  could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. � In conclusion, the setting played a major role in the story.	2	1		2																					
743	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The man was riding a bike through rough lands. His adventure wouldn�t of been an adventure if he was just riding his bike an flat smooth element. The fact that the hills were steep, rocky and many hills is what made his bike ride what it was.	1	1		1																					
744	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is the old timers advice of how to get some were. Than the town they told go to was a ghost town. After he keep going the place that they told him to get water was very old and rusty and he pumped it he gaid tar came out. Than as he made his way in the dessert there way a snake came in the road he go around it. So never take advice from old timers.   	1	1		1																					
746	3	The riders condition was rough, from flat land to rolling hills. This would be hard for some one who is dehydrating. There was a snake in his path so he went around it. This would be dangerous he could blackout from lack of water and then get bit by the snake.	1	1		1																					
747	3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly effected by his surroundings. First, he described a beating sun and pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent. The setting is active just like the cyclist. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad souding corral. When these old, forsaken things one mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair. And to tap that off, he drinks water that tastes like �battery acid.� Battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
748	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the setting is able to affect the cyclists emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways. As the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved showing positive influence but the pump oozes a shine like substance he referrs to as tasting like �battery acid� changing his mood for the worst. Finally, the pebbles he puts in his math show is desperation and willingness to try anything to survive show a new posotive outlook on the desert until a pump �lodges are in his thro at� making yet another negative influence. All of these feature lead him on his way to �Gary and will fish camp� and grounded an extra boost on his journey through the desert.	3	3		3																					
749	3	"The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and their is no where to go. An example from the test is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. Thats what affected the cyclist the heart the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most all no directions."	2	1		2																					
750	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because where they were.It was like in te middle of nowhere and every person they asked are having all times.They go the wrong directions to the nearest town.The old guy told him it was @NUM1 miles down the road when he went @NUM2 miles to the next town and said to him self he will never take directions from a gut that has all timers and hasn�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
753	3	The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story �do not exceed posted speed limit� It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California all worn down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated. It says in the essay �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a georgus day in June simply because I listend to some gentlemen.� this explains on how simply exhausted he had become due to the miles of cycling, and the beating down sun and total lack of water due to absence of all towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhausgen because of the faulty directions of the old people. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions.	2	2		2																					
755	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because every thing that was happing years ago are happen now in todays world meaning wars. Rights & etc todays feature is the same. Every thing is repeating it�s self.	0	0		0																					
756	3	When riding a bike it @MONTH1 not seem to hard. For a cyclist every thing becomes more serious. The determination to win and be the best even if it kills you. In this essay he under estimates the dder cyclist. When really they are the people with more knowledge. Some of the things that @MONTH1 be hard for cyclist are the rough roads. Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke. As road get worse chances get higher tumble weeds and snakes in the way, he was determined to win. After all was said and he faced the horror that nature brought him he knew he was wrong wrong for them and the intelligants.	2	3		3																					
757	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The �towns� he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldn�t get more water or a place to rest. �I was doing a water depleating @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel�. This shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
758	3	Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride.	1	1		1																					
765	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to @ORGANIZATION2 greatlly affected the cyclist. One the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road weren�t the most comfortable to be riding on. In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to Yosemite National Park greatlly affected the cyclist. One the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road weren�t the most comfortable to be riding on. There was nothing insight for the cyclist to see. The cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for him. The author states, ��  gaining elevation while loosing hope.� Last the weather was hot and dry which tired the cyclist out. He had no water with him and with the weather he had no energy or hope to help him through the journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
766	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit the cyclist expirenced a few life threating times during his adventure. The first feature was when was in a deseret with temptures of @NUM1 degrees and his lit bit of water tasted like battery acid. As he tried to keep going he lost hope and thought he was going to die. This affected him because as he lost hope he thought more negative about things and didn�t think he would make it but the he got the agility to move on. In this story the setting affects the characters dramatically.	2	2		2																					
768	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California.� This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse at minute from heat exaustion. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
770	3	I am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him. The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot & drinking his water & he would soon run out of water & dehydrate. For example in the story the cyclist would always bring up the little bit of water he had left & around the essay he talked about the dehydration he was seeing & even death. Another example is the relif he had when he drink the water from the sink. In conclusion, this is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
771	3	This paragraph tells about how careful you should be on the roads.This also talks about what you have to be aware of.There so many things that could happen.You have to take control when your on the road.	1	1		1																					
772	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states �This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town.� This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
775	3	The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June traveling back rodes, with no place to stop for water, if the cyclist would have followed the path they intended on following the ride probably have been more enjoyable and he/she wouldn�t of had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water, they would have been fine.	1	1		1																					
776	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die � �(Kurmaskie).	3	2		3																					
777	3	The main features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the fact that it was June and the dessert heat. �� I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�.� (kurmaskie @NUM1). This helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of California dessert. This affected the cyclist by his dehydration and the fact that he was inthe middle of no where with no one to help him. This is how the month of June and the dessert heat affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
780	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they don�t ride as much anymore and don�t know the best routes to take. So they just take their old routes, thinking they are still the better way, but when they use them they realize how tiring and bad they are.	1	1		1																					
781	3	�At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..� being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel. The sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point. The sign that said �Rough @CAPS1 ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� had to be intimidating. Considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast. Those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office. yes like the writer said �the world is a fluid place.  Things  change.� The old men probably had close to no due what they were talking about considering things have changed since @NUM1 (when carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, must have been rather intimidating. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more. In eseance I think the setting was a major part why the cyclist felt that way	3	2		3																					
782	3	From what there is in this  picture the cyclist is riding a dry and area which could mean that it is very hab and the cyclsit looks to be going down hill there looks to be a lot of turns. From the body position of the cyclist he seems to be trying at his best and hardest to make it to his destination. All of this could be a bag stress on the cyclist, he maybe sweating really hard and maybe tired the wind @MONTH1 not be helping him at all.	1	1		1																					
783	3	In the short story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� by @PERSON1, a cyclist travels through an extreme climate and tough terrain that nearly end his life to get to his destination. After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first �town� the locals said he�d find is deserted. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has �the flavor of battery acid.� With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June�, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� @CAPS1 tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a �water-depleting @NUM3.� eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, knowing now to strike out on better days and better directions.	2	3		3																					
784	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. When she was riding it was very hot this caused the cyclist to lose energy and dehydrate. Also when the cyclist went through a terrain change. The road changed into rolling hills. This caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired. Also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water. Eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated. This whole situation implied to stick to your original plan. If the cyclist would have done that she wouldn�t have had to go through the hardships.	2	2		2																					
785	3	Each new feature of the setting in the essay entilled, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the cyclist in some way. For example, in the text , when the narrator stated that he had to avoid a � ridiculously large snake �crossing the road, he became more aware of his surroundings and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until he finally abided the large reptile. Also in the text, when, �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,� hope was replenished into the cyclist. This hope allowed the narrator to because more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building. Eighther for better or worse, a few feature of the setting arrives and affects the cyclist every step of his journey.  	3	2		3																					
786	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist�s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he @MONTH1 not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let  down for the cyclist�s mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned.	2	3		3																					
787	3	The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was �going to drop from heat exsostion�, he is riding through the desert in @DATE1, and he took directions from three old �gentlemen� sitting on a porch.	1	1		1																					
789	3	Well first off its very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily. And the hills are hard to get up so it would be a challange to get to the top. All I know is the lack of water can kill you if you get heatstroaks easily.	1	1		1																					
792	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s essay �Rough Road Ahead,� the speaker is biking through some rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention long distances. He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the Welch�s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen� (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey.	2	2		2																					
793	3	Desert, Hills and road condition and lack of water �all are how the setting affected the cyclist. First, the cyclist reveals he is in the desert when he exclaims, �I was trave ling throug the high deserts of california in June.� This means it was hot. Second the hills and road condition�s were horrible. The cyclist reveals this when he describes, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,� aid againg  It read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly, He had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from. So he drank all the rate he wanted. He then figured out the needed to conserve it but by then it was too late. The examples shows that the cyclists condition was harder than he expected them to be.	1	1		1																					
796	3	The setting was a hot desert in California that a biker got stuck in going to Yosemite National Park. These settings were hard on the cyclist. For example, he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed. He was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off. All of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though. He learn that just because they are old and looks wise they have information probably older than the artifacts at a museum. Besides he has a trust map: He got a lot from this trip.	2	2		2																					
797	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in �ghost towns�, there is no-one to ask directions from or to just talk to. Also, some pumped water from water pumps tastes like �battery acid� and could most likely make some one sick. Also, there are poisonous snakes and other dangerous animals.	1	1		1																					
799	3	In this @ORGANIZATION1 I will explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the short story �Rough Road A Head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� The whole ordeal occurs in the �high deserts of california.� @CAPS1 to the text the cyclist had taken �out of date� direction from elderly people who thought they new the way. The cyclist encountered a snake, ghost town ad shutdown factory. Most of the time the cyclist was going over.	1	1		1																					
801	3	"In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way. With only a few sips of water left he said'' � abandoned years earlieR, by the looks of it it had been a @CAPS1 Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of Juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.'' When only having a few drops of water and seeing that would have increased my thirst more. Another way the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way was "" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. sometime ife can feel so cruel.'' This remind him that hes not in a car, and that hes not even going half the speed limit. The setting affects the cyclist by reminding him how long his journey is, and now at this point he is suffering."	3	2		3																					
803	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the features is just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it. The cyclist gives you what you want and need to know so the affect would be about time the feature is finish play in noone would want to see the cyclist.	0	0		0																					
804	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting of a story is the background, place, and time the story took place. In the story, a cyclist needs to get to @CAPS1 Park. He stops and gets direction from a group of old men, who aren�t up with the times, and the cyclist gets lost. He faces drought, a snake, and being lost in the desert, the cyclist says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like a diamond back � blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, to"	1	2		2																					
806	3	The cyclist run into a diamond headed snake, is out of water and is in the middle of nowhere the thing I would do is find some rope or cord time old building or tree and hang myself for taking directions from old people  that havent left their porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
807	3	The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the �ghost town� early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned welch�s Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, �It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� @CAPS1, his suffering was through when he discovered a �fish camp,� with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist�s relief was so immense that he,� had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them.	1	1		1																					
808	3	The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe.	2	1		2																					
809	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he first didn�t know where he was going and took directions from people that he wasn�t really sure about. It was hot he was running out of water he had no idea where he was there were snakes. His water was running out. there were no sings he kept thinking that he would never take directions from an old guys and that he would stick to the future.	1	1		1																					
811	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting seemed to affect the main character (the cyclist) very much during his pedal, for example, whole the dry desert setting made him think that he could survive with out water, he became dehydrated. The first town, with @NUM1 degree watter could not satisfy his standards. The old velches June factory, was all run down, and is no longer in business, much like the desert, just old barren unuseland. While yes the cycalist survived the pedal, the desert setting opposed a great challenge for him. 	2	2		2																					
812	3	There are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist. One feature is that it is getting hotter and it will eventually effect him. The line �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirge.� shows that the heat  might be starting to effect him. Another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water. The line �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly� shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says �and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated. Those are some of the many features that effect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
813	3	The setting affect the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay. The mood of the essay I think is a sort of dry summer day, the sort of �oh my gosh, its really hot,� type thing. The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, tumble weeds and more to contribut to the hopeless feeling. Although he was secured, and didn�t die, it seemed like he would surely not make it judging by the lack of water, scorching hot sun, and distance, with enduring these conditions. So the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him.	2	2		2																					
817	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he went through many ups and downs. At one point flowed by blackish watter feeling somewhere in the neighbor of two hundred degrees.. weather wouldn�t cool down.	1	1		1																					
820	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuiou	3	2		3																					
823	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because it�s hot, and than theres no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� (@NUM1.). This exert from the test supports my previous statement about how it�s hot because the speaker tells us how he�s sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage. �There was no one insight not a building, car, or any structure of any kind� (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance.	2	2		2																					
826	3	The features of a setting could be a number of different things. It could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, breezy and humid. The features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. The setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. In the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. These have been what I believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist.	2	3		3																					
828	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the person who rode the  bike was very tired his legs and body needed a rest after riding on his bike for @NUM1 miles into the pedal. Also it effected the cyclist because of all the riding he had to do struggleing to get where he was trying to get but he was a strong man and he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling. He was also restless but he did it.	1	1		1																					
829	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined.	1	1		1																					
830	3	In the story, the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1�s Fish camp, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclist�s attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not.	3	3		3																					
834	3	The feature of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described which implies that the biker probably had a hard time half way through the story he said, �Flat road was replaced by shor, rolling hills.� He said this to describe the difficulty in this race. It also makes it seem exciting because it changes things around. It wouldn�t be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didn�t show the terrain change at all.	1	1		1																					
835	3	Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a group of old guys and ends up lost on rough road with no water, or relylittic supply of flat road was replaced by short rolling hills large highways lon jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� The rough road made have to work harder want more water and just made things tougher more than what they already were.	2	2		2																					
839	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point.	3	2		3																					
842	3	When the cycleist mentions how hot and dry and open the terrain is, it makes me feel like he is in the desert. I also know that it�s hot because he is swreating and dehydrated.	1	1		1																					
843	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he�s fine. �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them� (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn�t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, �It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� he knows that things are going to get rough, because �the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph�. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn�t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, �tumble weeds crossed my path.� The landscape seems to get more threatening too, �a ridiculously large shake.� The landscape changes with the state of water."	3	3		3																					
844	3	The setting affects the cyclist because the heat and no humanity makes him so crazy. If he was in a place like @LOCATION2. It would be just the heat because there are people every were in @LOCATION2 @LOCATION2. If he was in @LOCATION1 it would be the severe temperature drop and no humanity and he would probably die.	1	1		1																					
845	3	the features of setting that the cyclist run into does affect him. For example when the setting changes from abandoned town to an empty deserted rond that no been on in thirty years; gives a cyclist less motivation him self to go on and even less strength.	1	1		1																					
849	3	The features of the setting could affect this cyclist. In this case it do effect the cyclist. According to the text �Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� This is a good example because he knew that this road was going to be rough and he was only going 12 mph. So the features of the setting did effect the cyclist. 	1	1		1																					
851	3	"The features affected the cyclist in many ways, one being the highway sign, ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" The terrain was now short, rolling hills, which would make it harder on the cyclist to pedal up the hills, for it would take a lot more effort and energy. Also, there were roadblocks, �at some point, tumbleweeds blocked my path and a ridiculously large snake �These roadblock would danger the biker, for he�d have to manever around them, losing time and energy, resulting in drinking more water. No water is a great danger for it was June, a hot day and he is risking getting dehydrated. There was also nobody around, so if he desperatly needed water he couldn�t"	2	2		2																					
852	3	After reading �Do not Exceed Posted Limit� I have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who tell him a bad shortcut. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. �that mood� was replaced by short, moving hills.� The cyclist could not er nuertecy tried everything, not showing how long he have to continue going up and down. There at one point he says, �@CAPS1 can feel so cruel.� There, he is upset because a road sign come up through acid tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also. When you take a short cut in life, there are always consciences as you decide to drop out of high school is go on how with your journal, where is always the posibility of is not working, and where you cry with no diploma ?? and he gets a job	3	3		3																					
855	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there is poisonous snake out thre. Your the only person ridin dow those hills all by your self. The guy had said that the next town was @NUM1 miles from where he was at. The lack of water that there were not any streams or rivers around there just in a desert with nothing.	1	1		1																					
856	3	The setting is mid summer in California in the desert. It is hot, humid and very dry. There is a lack of water in his bag. He is on a trip, going down the lost, rough and rigorous roads.	1	1		1																					
857	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, your in the desert cycling for many hours very hot and only have limited water. This affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park. Anothe example, is that you are going up and down rolling hills and you legs get very tired so they don�t want to move any more. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you and your sweating so much and @MONTH1 be seeing thing but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
858	3	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become deyhdrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water.	1	1		1																					
860	3	The setting that affect the cyclist is the condition of the road because the road turns all different ways and the road goes up hill so it makes it harder to go up the road the cyclist has @NUM1 miles befor he gets to a town he could run out of water. If he run out of water befor he gets there, he might have to make stops so he doesn�t make hisself sick. When he gets to the town he can get more water.	1	1		1																					
868	3	To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would about @NUM1� outside and sunny. You can�t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move in the snow. You can�t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could getin a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you be able to ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride.	1	1		1																					
869	3	this story is set in the hot in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote �about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first �town�. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one time�. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone.	2	2		2																					
870	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park, thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town. The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store. If it hadn�t been so hot, if the �towns� along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadn�t been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the affore mentioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
871	3	Hot, terrain, middle of nowhere- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the hot weather in California made the cyclist thirsty and almost dehydrated. There was no place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad and warm. Second, the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere. He couldn�t get water to hydrate himself or to sit down and rest.	2	1		2																					
873	3	The cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1� was riding through the California dessert in June. This dry, bare setting made it impossible to find any source of water. The only time that this cyclist found water was when it @NUM1 and tasting of battery acid. There was nowhere for him to find water for miles. This lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily. He even says that he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone. By taking the advise of the old men and taking a �short cut�, the cyclist past through ghost towns with no water. This �short cut� prolonged his trip, most likely by hours If he had gone through populated area despite the fact that it is a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would allow him to go faster. The dry, hot setting of the old men�s �short cut� made this cyclist�s trip last much longer than nessiarry.	3	2		3																					
874	3	When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says �Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� As he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty. There was eventually nothing. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, �a large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved.	3	2		3																					
875	3	When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his �water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips� (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships.	2	2		2																					
876	3	The features of the setting put an affect on the cyclist. The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds, and a ridiculously large snake. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play.	2	2		2																					
878	3	The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be �There was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is �wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who haden�t been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly.	2	2		2																					
880	3	The settings and features are very important to cyclists one because water and food try might carry a waterbottle and a snack but they need to know  where they are going and if they will need to bring extra or not. In the story I just read he didn�t bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble. Its important that a cyclist knows where their going and whats around them so they don't get lost and have no acsess to food or water.	2	1		2																					
881	3	"The features of setting effected the cyclist because he was in a desert in the month of June which was really hot and dry, there were also no trees around so there was no shade for him to relax in so the sun was also beating on his back. There was also lots of hills that took his strength to jump for example it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" There was also a big crazy twist in his way. He even saw a snake. All of these things made him really tired for example he didn't have much water and the sun was making him hot and dehydrated. There was no shade so he had to just take the sun beating down on his back. He had to jump over hills so that took alot of energy. He had to ride up one long hill so that also made him tired. All of these things happened back to back without giving him a break, so it really tired him out."	2	2		2																					
884	3	How the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads, rolling hill, and the?? heat. The conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough. An example firm the texted is � I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short ralling hills. These condition make is hard for the cycled it gives him a challenge.  The rolling hills challange him a regret to stay on the road it is easly tricky and challenges so was The heat & sun was also played an affection on the cyclist. An Examples from the @CAPS1 is.� I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat doing but I barely not ???. the sun was not starting to get him  ?? sharply ??  It will start to get ????? when is ?? is high deserts. I conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways but he keep pushing himself to more on.  	3	2		3																					
885	3	In the setting of Do Not Exceed Posted Speed  Limit, is riding a bike really fast on a rough road.	0	0		0																					
887	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the �high deserts of California�, making a hint that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he must�ve been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the sun beating down on him. Second, he began to ride through hills, and as common sense would be used, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle especially up hill, and it wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water must�ve tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water. As you can tell, the difference in setting plays it�s crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply.	2	2		2																					
889	3	The setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first place he arrived at was a �ghost town� Then he reach a water pump about twenty miles up the road. The water was very hot and tasted very nasty. The text states, ��water feeting somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. Then he had to travel without water and became dehydrated. Travelling up and down hills he thought he began to imaginate a building that could possibly provide he with water. The building was there but it was abandoned. He decide he was going to such on a couple of pebbles. The text says, �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thrist��	2	2		2																					
890	3	"It is my hot so the cyclist is very dehydrated, tired and lack of water. �I checked my water supply and heated on� is a good example oF this. There is also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around this bars the cyclists hope of finding civilization. Also not seeing any building and when he sees are it being deserted makes this very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he @CAPS1 the pump that has tar, dirt, then hot water in it. Also the road plays a toll on him. I know this house he says �If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill I�ll be alright"".This is how I know the setting and features in the setting is affecting the cyclists mentally and physically."	1	1		1																					
891	3	Hot, alone, no water � all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is very hot as the cyclist is riding. This makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated. The cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight. If anything happened to him there is no one to help. The cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy. With very little water it is hard to stay hydrated. Hot, alone, no water- all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
893	3	"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" has a major effect on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..       "	3	3		3																					
897	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by travelling very far where he is going. For example, ""About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town."" good thing that he is taking water or who knows if he would of survived or not. I think the biggest mistake was that he asked probaly someone that had not ever been on the road for directions. When he asked the person he ended up at a sign that said Rough road Ahead: Do not exceed, that was the moment I felt sorry for him, and that was probaly the effective feature that has happen to him."	2	2		2																					
899	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist. It was a hot June day and the water supplies he had was running out. He got the wrong directions homThese old men so he would had to ride  his bike longer than he had to and he would need water from pedaling all that way for nothing. Since he was going in the wrong direction there were no buildings for him to get water, there were no people so he couldn�t communicate and there would be no one to call for help incase he was over heated from the heat.	2	2		2																					
902	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The speaker tells us that he�s riding his bike in the middle of the desert in June. This shows the author is probably very hot. The author tells us that the road turned into hills and bumps. This would make it more difficult for the author because he would have to use more energy to move up the hill. And lastly, the cyclist tells us that the �towns� he came to were abandoned and uncared for. This would not be good for the cyclist because he would be able to get water for his trip.	2	2		2																					
905	3	The features in the setting of the essay affected the author greatly. The Hills, on a hot day, with no water, or nearby town is really rough, expecially if you�ve been riding for more than @NUM1 miles. The environment of the hot June weather near a dessert area can cause serious problems, for example heat stroke and since he had no water to drink dehydration caused a lot of fear in the author. The setting of the essay and the conditions the author were under were extreamly dangerous and hes lucky he made it out alive.	2	2		2																					
907	3	In the short story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of, old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their parches since carter was in office, �and quickly realized that he shouldn�t have. The author describes the setting of the first �town� as, �the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This didn�t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and corral that couldn�t hold in the largest mule.� Was what met him there. The cyclist said that �this sight was troubling.� It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This short story shows how anything can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival.	2	2		2																					
910	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affected the cyclist in the story. �Not two miles into this next reaction of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (kurmaskie). the cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy, than flat riding. This energy, loss coupled with the cyclist lack of water causes him to become even more miserable. The setting of this story greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
912	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in a harsh way. At first, the cyclist was fine and going strong, but soon after the first ""ghost town� he was getting weak. Then the cyclist had to face a few problems. For example he was running low on water. Also, he faced rough roads last, he faced snakes and abandonment. The cyclist had to face many obstacles, but in the end, he pulled through strong."	1	1		1																					
918	3	The dessert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, their would be no refills because the pump was only giving � tarlike substance� said the text. With the lack of water dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the � ridiculously large snake� he had seen. A finale effect would be mirages that could loose your judgement. This man double checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by �[wipping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage,� Through all the toughest desser obsticles the character was able to take the short cut and survive heat, dehydration, and animals of the dessert.	2	2		2																					
919	3	"I think the features in the setting of the story ""Do not exceed the speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, highly affect the cyclist. Some implied a information would be that it is very hot out, and the people in towns didn't help him. I know that it is not because the text says,""somewhere in the neighbourhood of @NUM1 degrees."" This implies that it is very hot outside. I can tell the people in towns didn't help him because the text says, ""Never accept travel advice from collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""This shows that the people in towns didnn't help him. Some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road, and a shake was in his way. I know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text. ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. ""This comes right out and tells you there is a rough road. You know there is a shake because the text says, ""and rediculously large snake blocked the majority of the road. I think there are many implied t expressed information in the story""do not exceed the speed limit. "	3	2		3																					
923	3	In the essay the setting had every thing to do with  the cyclist cause he is ridding through the desert with batey tay water. He is pedaling through the dry heat thats tough even you had water pluse there were hills deadly snakes.Its dangerous enough with out that stuff being there. So I would listen to the cyclist & never ever listen to old men.	1	1		1																					
925	3	�Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from �old timers� the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that�s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn�t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn�t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn�t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. 	3	3		3																					
927	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if they weren�t hills and rough roads, he would of been able to get to yosemite park faster and he wouldn�t of ran out of water.	1	1		1																					
929	3	In my opinion the features of the selling affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he was talking abut the terair changing from long strat roads to shard winday one and the speed limit changing he said.he was doing a waterdepleting @NUM1 fuier sands like he is having a hard time, or doesn'twnt to go on.	1	1		1																					
930	3	Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, ��The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him.	2	2		2																					
935	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1� the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn�t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn�t have been so worried. What�s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn�t have struggled so much at the end. �At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.  	2	3		3																					
942	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of @LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has almost no water left. This lack of water makes the cyclist desperate for food and water. The setting has a lot to do with how the cyclist reacts to what happens.  	1	1		1																					
943	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, because there was no one in sight he couldn�t ask for any help or direction. Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didn�t help him it just tired him more. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have biten him and then he wouldn�t be able to make it anywhere because of the bite. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
944	3	"The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. It affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to trudge over and the lack of water he has. The rolling hills make him tired and weak along with the rough terrain. The lack of water doesn�t help any when he�s thirsty because of the hills. The features affect him mentally because the farther he goes the more dalerious he gets. Each more mile he keeps telling himself, if I can just get there I�ll be fine. He also blames himself for listening to the old men. And with this also came doubt. He was doubting that he could make it alive. In the story it says, �it didn�t really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean"". mentally he couldn�t make it."	2	2		2																					
945	3	When the rider was riding his bike in such day settings has started to need water he was running out, So his whole adventure was to find water. Being thirsty was very hard because it made him not want to keep going because he was so tired. It made him harder on him. But it also got him more strength and because in himself, and keep on pushing. 	1	1		1																					
946	3	�Do not Exceed the posted speed limit� tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of �the serenity of an early summer evening,� and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the �town� he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclist�s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.	3	3		3																					
949	3	The setting in the essay �Rough Road ahead; Do not Exceed the speed limit� affected the narrator in many ways. The first thing that affected his ride was the heat. at first he didnt really notice but then it began to slow him down. Then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride, the roads went from flat sheet to short, rolling hills.� The road change and the heat made him say �I could drop from heatstroke.� Then because of the old towns he went through he was unable to get water. The water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality.	2	2		2																					
950	3	The complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story. His trip goes from bad to worse as he progresses to Yosemite. After taking directions from the �old codgers,� the author attempts the shortcut, but is dissapointed. He arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted. He rubbed it off though, and kept �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,� as his motivation. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued. Just as if things couldn�t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope. He became even more of a pessimist when �a ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavement�� He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned. He even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration. When he finally found the fish camp, he was relieved. All the obstacles he prospered through were worth in the end.	2	1		2																					
953	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind. She didn�t knew where she was and on hip of that got lost. Whether you see nothing around. You or alot around you, you�re going to feel scared. They have the same affect. In the authors case, she was cycling and didn�t/couldn�t and water. This is an over whelming feeling because you can die from dehydration. She then kept cycling and saw nothing. �no one insight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� That is alatining no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die. These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They dffinately affected the cyclist because she was by herself, and on her dvun. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike and an empty water bottle.	3	2		3																					
954	3	The features of this story tend to affect the cyclist very much. Because he took a shortcut he had an even longer journey than before. He was in the middle of no where with barley any water left and on top of all that he�s exhausted from all the hills on the terrien. So because he took a shortcut it ending up costing him in the long run.	1	1		1																					
955	3	The features of the setting in the essay affected he cyclist because first of all he lisined to old fowks that hav�nt left their front porch in about ten years. Then he didn�t ask someone elses apirean on where to go and how to get there. His worsed mistake tough was not trusting the map he had with him the howl time. If he would have just trusted his map and not when with when the old fella said he wouldint have almost died of heat stroke.	2	1		2																					
956	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, �I  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.� In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water.	1	2		2																					
957	3	The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main charater is biking throug a desert in the summer with little water. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will sarley die. The main character says, �The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.� The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main characters energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main characters biggest problem is the heat of the setting.	2	2		2																					
958	3	The setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way. �About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town� (Kurmaskie). The cyclist put the words towns in to parentasis because it was actually a Ghost town. no on lived there, It was abandoned. Around the cyclist was deserts, and more empty towns. The father the cyclist got, the more we realized the old men were wrong as the cyclest was running low on water and there was no where to stop. He finally found some and vowed to never listen to old mens directions again.	2	2		2																					
960	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road:Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit�by Joe kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way.It begins slowly with the �ghost town�.The narrorator �chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,� he wasn�t especially worried,but the fact he checked his water suggests that he�ll need to ration it for a while.The decline continues when he reaches the fock and the �ramshackle shed.�@CAPS1 the description of the place shows you he did not like it,and he confirms that with the words,�this sight was troubling.�He wouldn�t be replenishing his water here.Any more of this he�d be dead,either from dehydration or from pessimism.Eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea.This is ironics,he only going 12 mph to put it in his own words,�sometimes life can be so cruel.�He quite obviously hates the setting,and it�s all the fault of the setting.	3	2		3																					
969	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a �run-down� rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.	3	3		3																					
971	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because It give it more life. More meaning and make I fun to read.	0	0		0																					
974	3	During this essay the author is talking about his journey	1	1		1																					
976	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water. When he coudnt.	1	2		2																					
977	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was �travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the �sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,� which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist	2	3		3																					
983	3	Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no.	1	2		2																					
984	3	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One reason was that he was in the desert. Like in the quote �through high deserts of California. This means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke. Then he couldn�t even get any water. Like on the quote �of the rusted water pump.� it was describing how old it was then the cyclist got some out but it tasted like old battery acid. Therefore the features and setting afected The cyclist.	2	1		2																					
987	3	"In the essay �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldn�t hold in the lamest mule.� This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
989	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. Fem the ghost town to the bait shop, it was all a challenge for him. A misleading challenge , But a challenge . In the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself. From staring at the horizon to get to a place to another from sucking on pebble stone to not focus on water. And when he arrive at the bait shop. A sense of relief came to him, like that shop was his safe haven. But yet he would never get directions from any old-timer again. Lack was not a factor in this story. Rather it was drive and overal climate of the story. When it was two �hundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light. And also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it.	2	2		2																					
990	3	The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers so that he could take a short cut. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert. It says in the text �when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid� This shows that he had no water left to kept him dehydrated throughout his travel. Also in the text it says �with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill� this shows that he had no energy left.	2	2		2																					
991	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. �I noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling @NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
995	3	"The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride easy for him or tough for him. In the essay it said ""No Town"" but without a town theres no water and water @MONTH1 lead to dehydration. It also says something about flat roads turning into ""short, rolling hills."" This means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused. Those are some examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.  "	2	2		2																					
997	3	The settings in this article effect the cyclist by having to bike a lot of miles to get to the next town. The cyclist has limited amount of water and its very hot out. Theres nothing insight for miles and miles.	1	1		1																					
1000	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, �They�d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey.	1	1		1																					
1001	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit �the cyclist has some very rough obstacles on his way to Yosemite National park. With his lack of water and diredness he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black. He easily passes the snake and moves on. Being in the intense heat and with know water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he go's this way is because @NUM1 �old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office�. These guys gave him wrong directions. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other stuff wouldn�t have happened if he payed attention to his surroundings and people around him.	2	2		2																					
1004	3	The setting affect of a cyclist can be petty complicated. So many things has to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up have to be prepared for the weather. For example when there is serious weather conditions like rain,snow you have to careful of ley roads.Also they have to be prepared for is long riais. Some naes might be from @NUM1 miles the have to bring plenty of food and water. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike. For instance he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going cooperate. Also if work need's to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on.Also another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist is in shape. For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint.	1	1		1																					
1005	3	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.	1	1		1																					
1006	3	The setting in the short story; �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit� greatly affects the cyclist. The rough terrain and blazing sun test him and make him suffer in ways he never imagined. One point, after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes, �Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� this setting has caused the cyclist to become so dehydrated that he can�t think. The cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him. As you can see the setting has a very strong affect on the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1008	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist is affected by the setting mently and physicly. For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don�t think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way	2	2		2																					
1009	3	"In the essay, �Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling�, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, �The sun was beginning to beat down�, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a �modernized� town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."	3	2		3																					
1010	3	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such a empty terran that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strenght to go on and get to safty.	1	1		1																					
1012	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s, �Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� there are several features that effect the cyclist. �..and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie) Deserts in June are extremely hot and dry and caused the cylist to become dehydrated quickly. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The change from flat lands to hills made the ride more strenuous on the cyclist. These conditions directly affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1013	3	The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was riding through the deserts in June. The cyclist barely had water at the end of the stony. A lot of buidings were abandoned, right when he needed water. That is how the setting affected him.	1	1		1																					
1015	3	The features like not enough water not enough sense of direction, effect the cyclist because he needs water to keep on peadiling. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going. From not enough water he said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and there been sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that pargraph� That site ment that the old man�s sense of directin was out of date. They did not no where any thing was at just there in giant poarch.	1	1		1																					
1016	3	The features of the setting is that it is hot and dry. The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets very hot and he drinks almost all of his water and he only has about @NUM1 sips left when he gets to the other town. It also effects him because he had an advantage. The advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up. So then he had a time to get cool. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind. Also when the cyclist was thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth.	2	2		2																					
1017	3	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist�s mood and energy. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself.	2	2		2																					
1019	3	All the features of the settings affect his rythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can. Instead of thinking about it. If I was him I would just ride my bike & think about I thing winning!	1	1		1																					
1020	3	To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was given very old directions. He was given back roads that are abandoned now. These towns had no people in them normally that would not matter, but he �was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� (@NUM1). If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A �ghost town� with no good water could have killed him. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them.	2	2		2																					
1024	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way.	2	1		2																					
1026	3	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist. Now the setting is in the california desert on a hot day in sane wich caueses the cyclist to drink all of his water wich later malice him dehydrated. The barren desert with no landmarks causes the cyclist to become lost wich is the main problem with the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1027	3	"The setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome. The author makes a mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by @LOCATION2 standards, where it gets to @NUM1 degrees, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at @NUM2. By noon, it's past @NUM3. Also, the author comes to a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� @CAPS1 he makes note that he�s only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last ""tentalizing sips,"" This is his main problem, his lack of water. He drank most of it in the beginning of his ride, thinking he�d be okay, but he regretted it later on"	2	2		2																					
1028	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try  forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were �I was going to die.� First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp. Her setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive.	1	1		1																					
1031	3	Features of the setting affect cyclists greatly. Things like weather, terrain, temperature, altitude can make or break a cyclist. In this essay, the heat and hills on the road challenge the cyclist. He just keeps going through, and eventually he gets to civilization. This lets you know that you can�t mother nature control you.	1	1		1																					
1032	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The author is getting worn out and is rapidly running out of water. He �was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. This shows how the setting is causing him to become greatly exhausted.	1	1		1																					
1033	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist tremendously. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles until he passed through the flat round, that was replaced by short rolling hills. He said and I quoted �I toiledon� he sounds like it�s hopeless, that he wasn�t going to make it. As you can see the setting does effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1034	3	The setting of �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of louage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there. �I got down on my hands, and knees, working,the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength. He was so thirst and tired he didn�t know how else to get some water	1	1		1																					
1035	3	"In the setting the young man is faced  by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person. For example he was proud of himself he mad himself happy by saying at the end ""yes sir! I own a very good map"". He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supplie of water to get to where he was determined to be Yosemite."	1	2		2																					
1039	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man�s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	1	2		2																					
1041	3	In the short story �Rough road ahead .Do not exceed posted speed limit ,� The cyclist faced many difficulties .These difficulties were the result of the setting .The story takes place in �the high deserts of California in June � .Because the month June is very warm , and the climate of California is usually hot and dry ,the cyclist ran into problems .Not only did this affect the cyclist , but he travelling through the desert .The setting also included several abandoned towns along the way , which contributed to the problem .The cyclistsoon ran out of water , and discovered the towns that lay before him were unoccupied .He had no choice but to continue with his the journey .	2	3		3																					
1042	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist is many different ways. One way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out. Since the cyclist is getting worn out he needs to drink more and more water. Now that he�s drinking more water his running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it. Then when he starts to use less water to conserve it until he gets to the next town he starts to become dehydrated and more tired and he starts to feel weak. Also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired. It also starts to get hotter and he gets thirsty more often. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1043	3	In the poem �Do not exceed speed limit� the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says �At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake� This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read �Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.	1	1		1																					
1044	3	The feature of it is the landscape the characters the plot the end and the begining.     	0	0		0																					
1045	3	The setting in �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits� affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the �cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on �there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.� At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out.	2	2		2																					
1047	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn�t so hot, then he wouldn�t of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn�t help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1050	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. �... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�. This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist.	1	1		1																					
1051	3	The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectaculiar and amazing like. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasn�t what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story.	1	1		1																					
1052	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in many ways, if it were hot out, he would be thirsty and sweaty. If there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty. The cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town. The cyclist said� I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine,� By saying this, he knows that he can make it that far as well as determined to do so. With the terrain causing even more trouble for him, would make it more difficult, but he knows that he must overcome his challenging activity but he still keeps a strong spirit with that, he can do just about anything because he has the encouragement he needs.	2	2		2																					
1054	3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .� The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,� In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it � had been a Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.� For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    	3	2		3																					
1061	3	The features of the desert changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. When the road began the change, the speaker�s determination did too, �Flat road were replaced by short hills�. The terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut. �I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listned to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades�. The heat in desert made the speaker thirsty causing him to drink all his water. There was no source of water therefore he decided to suckenc-stone. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst�,. But the bumpy terrain didn�t allow him to do that. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker began to panice, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�. But luckily the author thoughts changed after he found a supply of water, the features did affect the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
1062	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people, and cars on his �shortcut� he was in great doubt of his survival. �I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.� He thought he wouldn�t get any water because there was nothing around him and he thought he would die of dehydration or heatstroke. �And the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke.�	2	2		2																					
1064	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert. Also, the author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was beaming on him.	1	1		1																					
1065	3	In this paragraph I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, & animals. All things that the cyclist could not controll. Therefor affecting the cyclist while he rides through.	1	1		1																					
1067	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn�t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn�t in a �ghost town�, with the, �sun beggining to beat down�. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, �about forty miles into the petal�, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot.	2	2		2																					
1068	3	The features of the setting is very important for cyclist. If the setting is wrong they could be in many danger. It is really important to have a clear setting.	1	1		1																					
1069	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worse problems and couldnt really do anything about them. also, he started out fine, then he started to become dehydrated. He didnt have much water left and he was only @NUM1 miles up the road. a loss of water was very affective in June traveling through a desert. also, the damage of the road was very affective too because hes on a bike and not too good of balance. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, temperature, loss of water, road damages and snakes. the cyclist was on a bike and couldnt really protect himself, and he was dehydrated, and tired. 	2	1		2																					
1070	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for �rough road ahead,� @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging.	3	3		3																					
1072	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1077	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power.	2	2		2																					
1079	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in �high desert of California in June.� This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1083	3	The setting desented in the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer�s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.	2	2		2																					
1085	3	The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , �like a foolish yuuth,� folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He �ans almost dehydrated and �in an ironic twist� he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: �Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we�re your best bet � in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who �haven�t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office�	3	3		3																					
1086	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advise from people that no longer drive or even leave of the porch would be unuseful. When the author say �old timers who haven�t lest the confined of them porches since carter was in office� that what he is explaining. He then say �I rode  into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face� he was refering back to how hes  on the rode  alone riding the bike and theres not a car insight any where around. The curbs of the turns where so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safe as he did �He whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn�t mirage and tried not get to excited� @CAPS1 in this situation would have made many people excited about the long lonely cicle by his self.	2	2		2																					
1087	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer and more difficult and dangerous way to go. He takes the awee of going that way by some old folks that he says �haven�t gotten off there porches since carter was in office.� I think tha tthere would be a reason to not listen to them though they @MONTH1 have wisdom.	1	1		1																					
1088	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died.	2	1		2																					
1091	3	The hot wheather is dehydrating the cyclist, who can�t find more water. The hills are rough terrain is draining the energy he has. The heat is so rough he has to break the road down it to polants he wants to get to. He get drained physically and emotionally. He has a hard journey.	1	1		1																					
1094	3	The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because, he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehygrated it's not healthy and you die from it. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down,along with the sweat. As long as he has some lijid left, it should be ohang. 	1	1		1																					
1095	3	"The setting of this story is a dry, hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting, effect the author, because it shows how he starts of strong + determained and his left weak + doubtful. In the begining of the story, the author says, �Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as �the high deserts of California in June.� He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out. But he comes to a town, ""cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall."" @CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well."	3	3		3																					
1096	3	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If it�s too hot, you�re going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If it�s all down hill, it�s really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out. Features of the setting really affect a cyclist	2	1		2																					
1098	3	The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist. First, it is a very hot dry in June. The cyclist is maneuvering his way through �high deserts in @LOCATION1� where he comes across many hills that he must climb over and maneuver his way down. With all of these obstacles and the heat slowing him down he will need water but is already low.	1	1		1																					
1101	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because at first he had to watch out for the snakes that usually crossed the roads, then the streets were crooked and bumpy, so the road structure throw him off a bit, and he was riding his bike in June and it was very hot, and he had lack of water so he thought he was going to have a heatstroke. These things affected how the cyclist performed on his bike.	2	1		2																					
1102	3	The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says �About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town.� This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was �going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch�s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy. The conditions affected the cyclist	3	2		3																					
1104	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the settings affected the character because he thought he wouldn�t make it to the park because of the way things looked around him. Because of the rolling hills and snakes he didn�t think he would make it any where and thought he was going to die. That�s how the setting affected the character.	1	1		1																					
1107	3	One ramsackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubled. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck, I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didn�t take the old mans advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride he needed a new map.	3	2		3																					
1112	3	The setting effects the cyclist in away that most people can�t tell cycling forty miles on maybe a gallon of water is hard expecialy in California �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June� The effect on his body would be rather devastating.	1	1		1																					
1113	3	In the story the Features of the setting affects the cyclist is that when he is riding he has very little water. Also he takes advise from old men and he meets up with an @CAPS1 Snake and he goes down an dirt Road he has no water at the time there. The conclusion is that he comes of the dirt Road and @CAPS2 the main Road that he travels. Also he promised to stick to it in the @CAPS3. That is how you should stick things at in the future.	1	1		1																					
1116	3	The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left their porches since carter was in office.�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers �shortcut� and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says �Yes, sir! I own a very good map,� and �I�d always stick to it in the future.� The cyclist�s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible.	2	2		2																					
1121	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how everychange happened. For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldn�t feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.	1	1		1																					
1126	3	"He was affected by lack of water, the hills, snake in the way and the condition of the road.� The water bottles contained only a  few tantalizing sips. � This quote explains how the lack of water was a problem. The hills affected him by they were �crippling"". The snake it was long ways on the road and he didn�t know how to get passed it . Finally the   roads were rough and you should go  over the speed limit of 55 mph. So he was affect in a lot of different ways not just one."	2	1		2																					
1128	3	The cyclist is affected by the heat, the hills, and the lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing short on water and had �wide rings of dried sweat on his on shirt,� and he could �drop from heatstroke.� The hills must have forced him to use more energy, and lasely  the land of people. If the towns still had people the cyclist wouldn�t have been as affected by the setting.	1	1		1																					
1130	3	The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard. It has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy. Also, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry. This makes the author need more water than he normally would. The author said ��I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without water, he said ��I could drop from heatstroke�� If the setting had been cooler there would not be so much danger.	2	2		2																					
1133	3	The cyclist in the story rough road ahead Do not exeed posted speed limit, by Joe kurmashie, is heavily affected by the features of the setting in the story. First is the �shorecay� that is suggested to get    to @CAPS1, which naturally just ends up separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water. His water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die. In the story, he says: �It really didn�t matter. I was going to die and the lards would pick me clean.� This shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless.	2	2		2																					
1138	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit � the setting affected the cyclist. The setting affected the cyclist mentally and physically, when the setting was nice he had a positive outlook and was full of energy. Later in the essay, as the setting grew less appealing, and more treaterous, the cyclist grew weary and distressed.	1	1		1																					
1141	3	The featers of the setting afected the cyclist by the lack of water made him tiered and a bit deloshional. The lack of shade increased the rate of dehidrashion. The rough road made it hard to balinc. And the snack slowed him dowen. He thought that he was going to die.	1	2		2																					
1144	3	"At the beginning of his journey, the cyclist is relaxed and the features of his environment. He says, �I enjoyed the seranety of an early- summer evening.� At a campground in @LOCATION1, the setting is calming and relaxing. At the first town, the setting is shocking, but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous. After looking around he says. �this sight was trowoling�. The cyclist tip gets worse when he reads for the next town. �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This part of his journey affects him the most. His environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty. The setting has a major role for a cyclist."	2	3		3																					
1146	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.� So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn�t help him much.  	3	2		3																					
1149	3	"The setting of the essay �Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" is very dry, sandy, hot, and deserted. On his way to Yosemite he takes a �short cut"" from so he do me through the desert. When he first leaves its in a hot and flat part of the desert. His mood is high and her has confidence. �Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile of my face.� With this he arrives at the first �town� but hes wasn�t worried he had bad plenty of water he moves on. The terrain starts working against him in his search for water, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills a large high way sign jumped out at he. It read: Rough Road Ahead : Do not Exceed posted speed limit.� This lowers his confidence, especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke no one would he around to find him. He keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on. When he see the first comp he is overwhelmed  with relief and the terrain flattens out again. When asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest. He can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions."	3	3		3																					
1150	3	Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, @CAPS1 through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a domper on your experience, @CAPS2  it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation.	3	3		3																					
1151	3	The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite @ORGANIZATION1�l Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it wouldve made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle @MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn�t. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn�t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It�s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it. 	2	3		3																					
1153	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1155	3	 The story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1 had some statements that we were kind of pointless to put in. One of sentence in the essay had a couple word that don�t need to be used. In the sentence, about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first �town,� I don�t think �into the pedal needs to be in there because its not describing anything.	1	1		1																					
1157	3	The settings of the story is very desert like what I mean by that is its the desert and its hot and he really had to push his self to make it. The condition at the rode are very rough and has a lotof shape turn it in. Apart in the story he gets a boost of energy and pedal as hard as he can down a hill and then relaxes. This is the setting and is summary of the story.	0	0		0																					
1159	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June.Their is also a lack of water, some must pace his sips carefully. Therefore also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life.  The dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist. His journey does teach you though, that trough determination you will be rewarded. You have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to get success.	3	3		3																					
1161	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not being in town. I say this Because the cyclist talks about �old timeres who haven't left the contines of their porches since carter was in office."" So that means he dousen't know were he's at."	1	1		1																					
1162	3	In the cyclists journey to Yosemite, several factors hinder him from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders. The second is that because the information wasn�t true, the cyclist had an insufficient amount of water. This made him dehydrated. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads, and old ghost towns and abandoned buildings which made the cyclist less confident. Those are the features of the setting which affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1165	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclists because he was thirsty and it was hot and he was almost out of water and he almost died because when he was drinking the water and he hit a bump and spit got lodged in his throat and tiring hills it seemed to never end.	1	1		1																					
1167	3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water �to feel sorry for himself� The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to �rolling hills�. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist.	3	2		3																					
1168	3	The features of the setting really affect the cyclist. He is led into false pretenses by the immediate surroundings. Little does he know that it would bring him into danger? When he comes to a rock in the road and finds that the water pumps are not good he is in serious danger. In the reading it says �The sun was beginning to heat down, but it hardly noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.� The setting let the cyclists mind wonder so much that he didn�t even realize the heat.	1	1		1																					
1170	3	Setting affects many things in stories. The setting in this story affected the cyclist. The setting was very hot and it slowed him do wn a lot. For example he said he was doing 55 miles	1	1		1																					
1171	3	The setting in the story was the �high deserts of California in June.� At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldn�t make it he saw a sign that said �Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp� He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� and �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean� So this brought self doubting behavior. 	3	3		3																					
1174	3	"The setting affected the cyclist: due to the changes in terrain. A rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills. The author wrote, �I tolld on""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory. The narration states, �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words ""long"" and ""crippling."" @CAPS1 of those words provide feelings of being drug on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip."	3	3		3																					
1179	3	In the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn�t have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated.	3	3		3																					
1180	3	The features of the setting was affect the cyclist by disturb them to ride in road, limite their speed, and make their distance longer than the original travel plan. For example, the features at the setting was disturb the cyclist to ride in road because it tells them where they can go and where they can�t and they shouldn�t do this or that such as the sign of �no entering� or �one way�. Second, it�s limite their speed because if the features of the setting it said the limited speed is @NUM1, the cyclist only can ride about @NUM1 and go no more further which can make the cyclist longer time to reach the place that they want to go and couldn�t travel faster. Third, it make their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or how fast they can rode. Such as the sign of �Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit�. Therefore, the features of the setting was affect the cyclist during the journal.  	1	1		1																					
1184	3	In the story by Joe Kurmaskie it tells about a cyclists challenge through the heated deserts of California in June. The cyclist had started out with confidence, followed by determination, then relief. The setting affected the cyclist physically and mentally. First, listening to the old men was stupid, then taking the trip not certain if you would have enough water, and lastly traveling through the desert in June. He started getting a little doubtful with himself as well, that won�t help much with bringing success of the trip. Once he had made it to a fish camp an old man even older then the men who gave him the false information told him he knew how to get to Yosemite, but the young man did the best thing and told him he already knew how to get there. He didn�t need to be traveling out in the desert heat for hours that�s just unhealthy	2	2		2																					
1187	3	"In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the road, he saw that the terrain was changing and that scared him, he says �This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly �(kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes. He wasn�t going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone he still had the courage to go further. The setting brought him fear but he made it through."	2	3		3																					
1188	3	In the story the cyclisst had ran out of water. He had mentioned it tasted like battery acid. The surroundings affected him by looking around and not seeing anybody around for miles. That brings despair. Also a desert with the hot sun beating down on him and just the sand and catus all around. Now if you saw that you would think of no water or shade of noting because the desert is put to image when you hear those descriptions.	1	1		1																					
1189	3	"The features of the setting, in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affects the cyclist. The setting affect him both physically and mentally. In the story the setting provides no water for the cyclist making him weak. In the mental aspect he is greatly affected by the features of the setting. An example of this is when so see the abandoned welch's factory and sees the picture of a boy ""pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth�. This made him hang his head as he rode on. He is also thinking to himself that he will die out of here. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	1		2																					
1190	3	I believe the first photograph closely relates to the story �As worry� because the authors son suffs a lot. And it shows what he and his friends @MONTH1 look like. Also it shows the surf boards emphasizing there surfers. That is what I believe about the first picture. The second are only relate a little cause it has a surfer surfing. So in conclusion the first photograph is moreaccurate to the story than the second photo.	1	1		1																					
1192	3	In the story rough road ahead the cyclest is affected by the setting in many ways. Because he was in a desert in June it was very hot, so he got thirsty. Also because of the heat he could have dehydration of heat strokes. Lastly because it was a desert the wild animals like the snakes and lizards could hurt or posion him and he could die that is how the setting of the story affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1193	3	The cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1 suffers from some hardship while riding through the desert. The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation that means there is no water so he was becoming dehydrated. Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldn�t quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasn�t been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welch�s juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved. Also the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left, and rocky tent to take more strength and endurance.	2	3		3																					
1194	3	"In the passage DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the desert�s feature did not have any positive affects on the cyclist. The desert contained ""rolling hills."" When a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity. Because the cyclist used more energy to go over the hills he only had enough energy to ""feel sorry"" for himself. The more hills, the more energy lost, the more tired he became. The desert was also hot, and dry. Obviously, since he was in the ""deserts of California in June."" @CAPS1 the would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water but a ""tarlike substance"" came out instead. When he again stopped later for water it was ""cool"" and most likely refreshing. Riding his bike in the hilly, dry, hot desert the cyclist became tired and thirsty."	3	2		3																					
1195	3	The features of the settings effect the cyclist by obstacles in the settings. A obstacle is a object in the way of you and were your trying to go. Some obstacles in the story such as hills, forks in the road, and also rough road. In the story �@CAPS1 Road Ahead @CAPS2 Exceed Posted Speed Limit the rider runs into� a large highway sign jumped out at me it read: Rough road	2	2		2																					
1198	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,� this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time. The is why I think the salling affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1199	3	In the essay intitled �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� It talks about a gentlemen who is riding a bike to �Yosemite� and he does not know exactly how to get there. So he stops and ask some old folks and he says �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porchers since Carter was in office.� @CAPS1 means they are not familiar with the changes. After he leaves the old-folks he continues on his long hot journey. He begins to run out of water and so he begins to panic. Next he comes to the sign that said �Rough	1	1		1																					
1200	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is so hot the cyclist keeps drink and sweating water so he is really work down from dehydration and fatigue. Also just the feeling of how unsafe it is out there. Like how he saw a ridiculously large snake or how it just keep getting hotter.	1	1		1																					
1201	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. The setting and the features affected him not only physically, but mentally as well. The setting caused him to doubt himself and the men and also it kept him from having the energy needed to get to where he was going. Where the cyclist was riding, in California, affected him physically. It was hot, and he had no watter. This caused him to become tired and frustrated. The setting affected him emotionally as well. He started off fine, but as he went on, and as the road slowly changed to hills, he began to get frustrated and angred that he listened to the men. As he saw no buildings in sight for many miles, he began to lose his determination as well as hope. Lastly, when he saw the sign �Gary and @CAPS1 Fish Camp� he started to regain hope and become less frustrated. The setting and features of the essay affected the cyclist not only physically, but mentally as well. He started of determined, then as the setting changed he became doubtful and frustrated. In the end, he turned out satisfied as the setting seemed more hopeful.	3	2		3																					
1204	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn�t stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn�t know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasn�t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldn�t cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey.	2	2		2																					
1206	3	The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, He is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, ��but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst�� This @CAPS1 is saying that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to get his mind off of how thirsty he was. I think this @CAPS1 is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that effected how thirsty the cyclist got was how hard he worked which was also a feature of the setting since during the end of his trip, he met rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat even more than he was. This made him @NUM1 more dehydrated. This story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you.	2	2		2																					
1207	3	There are several features of the setting which affect the cyclist one is the fact that he is traveling on a hot day in June. �and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot @DATE1. �I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more. These glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, he was running out of water and there was rough terrain. The setting was not in the cyclist's favor.	3	3		3																					
1208	3	According to the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit'' the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One way the features of the setting affects the cyclist is that the mountains make the cyclist more tired. Especially because he no water, then having to go up and down hills really wears the cyclist out and causing him to lead into dehydration faster. The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also the snake affected the cyclist. The snake caused the cyclist to be afraid which added to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The factory caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and think about dehydration even more in the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of setting affect the cyclist a lot.	3	2		3																					
1211	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit� the setting affected the cyclist sense of direction. The cyclist knew where he was going and how to get there but the old men told him their �short-cut.� It ruined his own sense of direction because he was taking out-dated directions from �old-timers that hadn�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� That is how the setting affected the cyclist in the's essay.	1	1		1																					
1212	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness then it motivates you more. Than when there is a lot en stuff around you.	0	0		0																					
1213	3	Steep mountains, rolling roads, jagged rocks � are all reasons why the setting is affected towards the cyclist. Well the cyclist needs to know what is going on and what @MONTH1 happen. For example �Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This setting lead to a lot of changes. So yes the setting does reveals a lot and I guess it describes how the cyclist @MONTH1 react to it also. So yes I think the settings do affect the cyclist through this whole story.	1	1		1																					
1216	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is that on his way he had to deal with so many things. Like for ex he had trouble with the flat roads that was replaced by short, rolling hills. The next thing was there was a sign that was posted he could not ride @NUM1 he had to do @NUM2 and that made him disappointed. Then a large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. He became dehydrated. He became sad, hopless but still had energy to feel himself.	2	2		2																					
1218	3	The setting in the short story �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie is troubling to the cyclist �One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the tamest mule greeted me,� made him troubled that he was in the middle of nowhere. The quote, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� shows that he was troubled by having to go over the hills. As you can see the setting was very influental to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1221	3	The setting effected the cyclist severly. Biking in the desert following outdated directions nearly got him killed. He also came across several broken down factories and towns causing more dismay. However he came across a last stop that saved his life.	1	1		1																					
1222	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclistis affected by his surrounding. At first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground. His confidence is high, and he is ready to continue his adventure. As the day went on and all he could find was abondoned buildings he began to worry a bit water running low he come upon �one ram shackled shed, several rusty pumps� no sign of life. He realiced that his trip was going to be rough. The environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, he knew �travelling through the high deserts of California in June� his only chances of survival was to keep going. The mans surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp. If he had not been so aware of his surroundings he might have given up, but not making it out of the desert to �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite� would be to devastating	1	2		2																					
1224	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclist�s mood towards the rider. For example, in the essay �Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or sructure of any kind. I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizon� The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps� This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he could�t drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welch�s grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting�s features."	3	2		3																					
1225	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. When he was going up hill it was harder for him to pedal. The hot summer day was breaking him down. He was getting dehydrated because he had a little bit of water left. It said he was trying to keep his balance in my dehydrated state. He felt like giving up.	1	1		1																					
1235	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the beginning of the essay she was happy that she was getting a shortcut ""I followed their device and launched out at first light along a �shortcut� that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.� He thought he knew where he was going �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" When she entered the first town, �this sight was troubling�. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, �she was beginning to get worried/ run out of water, the next town was �only eighteen miles down the road."" He was now at the dehightrated state. � The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed he was now upset and expecting to die. He then saw a store, �Gary and wilbers fish camp�. He went in drank cool water and then on used his own map, rather than old guys."	2	2		2																					
1237	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclcist. The first feature that affected the cyclist was the desert terain, it very hot and there were no trees to provide shade. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty. So he drank more water than usual. Secondly, he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual so he had to conserve his water, which was making him became dehydrated. That all the towns we past through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely dissapointed him, it also furthered his dehydration. Just when the cyclist was losing hope he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finnaly got water to drink. So after all those dissapointments he found hope, in the small bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental boost to continue on with his journey to Yosemite national park.	3	3		3																					
1239	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1240	3	he wouldn�t know he would be faceing while rider or the road @MONTH1 be something bad might happen to his bike or one of his bike�s wheels or he might fall of his the bick he would set so tired that he can�t go any more he might give it up	1	1		1																					
1241	3	The setting sffects the cyclist by the need and comfort of riding down with no infrastructure around or people that most be the best mood nice and colun no cars and just him and the beautiful sky to ride with, like if there is infrastructure he must have to watch for people, cars and just have to day to streetsigns and act. So thats outing  the feature of the setting would affect the cyclsit.	1	1		1																					
1242	3	"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what developes the character but, that what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself."	3	2		3																					
1243	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. There were	1	1		1																					
1244	3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn�t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.�� You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them.	3	2		3																					
1248	3	The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory. No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1252	3	The feature of a setting can affect a cyclist energy. In the setting turns irds hills, it can every this Cyclist out.	1	1		1																					
1254	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert and heat with no water cause him to get dehydrated. The rolling hills and rough terrain tire him out. In the story it says �and growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This shows that the heat and terrain could cause him to over heat and live a heat stroke.	1	1		1																					
1255	3	The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example in the text he says �the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips� and then it goes on to say, �I could drop from from a heat stroke.� This showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat.	2	1		2																					
1257	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. If the road is rough you have to have the right bike. Then if you get a flat tire you have to know to look out for dangerous and posionous things. If you were in a real bad accident you�d have to be prepared just in case they don�t find you in time. You would have to know what nights were like. For example, if it got real cold at night you need to keep youself warm.	1	1		1																					
1259	3	"The cyclist�s condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat crippiled him or he traveled in search of Yosemite. He became lost and ran out of water making his situation worse. Being lost in seemingly the middle of nowhere in the hot heat he became exausted, dehydrated and fearing heat stroke and loss of consicencess. This is shown in the essay by, ""the growing realization that could drop from heatstroke"" And, ""It looked like i was going to lose concisness for the last time."	1	2		2																					
1260	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Limit�, were very dangerous to his life. The cyclist was traveling to the Yosemite National Park on a hot @DATE1. The cyclist traveled miles after miles on his bike only to past by deserted towns, �This place might have been thriving little spot...a ghost town.� The terrain was threatening because after twenty two miles or so, the cyclist had to overcome, �short rolling hills�, which would use more energy and make his thirst for water even stronger. The cyclist was out of water and the hot day was not helping. After a grueling journey, the cyclist used all the strength he had to go to a local bait shop and drank from the sink after the trechorous environment he was exposed to. The features of the setting in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� were life threatening and almost killed the cyclist, due to lack of water and the terrain he overcome.	1	1		1																					
1261	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist by teasing him. First it was the rippling streams that taunted his thirst, then the old faucet and last the welches grape factory. The strraing were the beginning stage simply provoking thirst then came the faucet. The faucet made him relise that he was dehydrated. And last the abandoned welches grape juice factory had him almost abandon hope. The setting was effecting his mood.	2	2		2																					
1263	3	"In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist. Certain features portray that this �journey� to Yosemite National Park was dreadful, but at the same time enjoyable. ""I would come to along this breeze jaunt."" The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more. �A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling.� This shows the dirtyness of the water. Also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive. It says �working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.� @CAPS1, the features portray sacrifice and bravely of the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1268	3	The features affect the cyclist.The setting affects the cyclist because it�s real hot. So he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men. Then come to find out these tips weren�t really short cuts. So now he�s riding and angry that he took their tips. Also he�s running out of water and becoming dehydrated. He sees an abonded place with water, but in order to get it you need to pump it. So he starts pumping and sees black gunk. He pumps for about @NUM1 to cool the water, but it doesn�t cool off. Come to find out the water tastes like battery acid. So he starts riding again. but encounters a snake. Luckily he gets away, but he feels that he�s about to die and regrets listening to men who haven�t got off their porch since @PERSON1 was president. What makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure. As as he's riding he sees a juice factory and goes there. Now it�s a fishing store and drinks lots and lots of water. He also says he�s never listening to old men and he�ll always use the map.	3	2		3																					
1269	3	As the author of the story goes on her bike trip, the landscape around her becomes less and less welcoming. The first thing the cyclist encounters is a rusty pump & old shed. When the cyclist tries to get water from the pump, she describes the water as very hot and not cooling down at all. When the cyclist continues, tumble weeds that look like �diamond head snakes� cross her path. She encounters no buildings for a long time when she does encounter a building, It is abandoned and suggests that people left because of the landscape. The cyclist encounters another elderly man in her journy but decides not to take his advice because of the path the last set of elderly men set her down. 	2	2		2																					
1270	3	The features of the surrounding setting affect the cyclist from hi/her performance for example, In the essay �Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted SPeed Limit� the setting is full of hills, twisting, rising and desending. All of these things are working against the energy that the cyclist has. Also, the lack of the people in towns give the cyclist a hard and depriving time on finding a water supply so he/she does not dehydrate. Third the weather in the essay has a great deal of being affected on the cyclist it is hot in the desert of California and the cyclist has to be very hydrated to continue on his bike ride.  	2	2		2																					
1271	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, they ware heat, lack of water, and hills. While on his journey he almost gets dehydrated because he does not have a good supply of water and he said they taste �like battery acid.� And he had to convince up the road for anothe @NUM1 miles so that he could finally replenish himself	1	1		1																					
1272	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist by hurting his ability to keep going. In this story the cyclist was faced with many setbacks or problems. At first he took advice from very old man who had out of date directions. Then the cyclist thought he could keep going on a very limited water supply. The cyclist then was getting dehydrated and angry. The cyclist then found an old building which raised his hopes only to drop them once he found out it was closed and rundown. Finally he finds a store and then dehydrates and is on his way again.	1	1		1																					
1277	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting is described as a rough terrain, which makes it harder for the cyclist to travel. Also it�s hot, and there are no buildings or people around. This also makes it hard for the cyclist because he runs out of water. throught the story the cyclist keeps going and ends up sarving	1	1		1																					
1278	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist because the surrounding is so negative. Everything around the cyclist is percieved negatively, so the naturally the cyclist feels like the task is harder and more challenging than it really is. For example, nothing is surrounding the cyclist but sand and the hot temperature since the setting is so empty and no one is around, then everything seems harder than it really is. Also the cyclist feels like he can�t go on and is weak because there is no living he around him. Furthermore, if the cyclist was in the park with the sun shining and people around and in sight, his attitude would change and everything would seem easier.	1	1		1																					
1279	3	The fatures of the setting affected the cyclist by it hard for him to control hill bike down on rough road, hotter making him thisty and running out of water. Also there wasnt an building in sight so he could get anything to drink. Also he did know where he was go. These are the features that affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1280	3	The setting affect the cyclist in many gruding and harsh was. First, the lack of civilization contributes to an uneasy feeling and an inability to refill his water bottle. Second, the heat and uphill bottles are taking their tollon both aplists physical and mental strength. Third, his water bottle is emptying at an alarming late due to his third and relentless heat. In paragraph four die exospodent cyclist reaches the first ''town.'' This place @MONTH1 have been a striving spell but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of ghost down.� @CAPS1 he came to house with a rusty water pump, which sped out brackish, near boiling water, which did not support the porched cyclist, physically, on mentally.	2	2		2																					
1282	3	"The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way. He intrusted that these men he had asked directions from knew what they were talking about. With the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination. Only to find deserted towns, disowned factorys, and hills. With all this being the �high deserts of California in June.� With all these aspects the cycalrst was worn out and dehydrated saying �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst"" shaving his deep name of thirst. After finding a place to get a drink he stated �I had an overwhelming and buy some bait� showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water."	2	2		2																					
1283	3	"In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert make him need alot of water resources. This is because the heat and exercise will dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he is desperate enough to try to drink out of an old pump that had black sludge in it. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.  "	1	1		1																					
1285	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere. First off the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about. Seccondly on his trip, he came accrossed an �Ghost town� with nothing in sight but a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water, the only water he	2	2		2																					
1287	3	In the passage �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� there are many features from the setting that affected the cyclist. One feature that affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way, for example in the text it says �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�, �I cased post, tyring to keep my balance in my dehydrated state� This proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by giving him a point to stay calm even in the state he was in being dehydrated and all the affects he encountered from that.	1	1		1																					
1289	3	The feature of the setting do affect cyclist in such ways making him illusionalistic and dehydrated. He saw all idea that a juice factory was working, when it was abounded. He saw rusty pipes, this made him dehydrated because he knew those pipes could never produce water.	1	1		1																					
1290	3	In the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� the settings of the story affect the cyclist. They make him think he will die and overall make him worried. In the story the cyclist takes two old men�s advice on the best way to get to Yosemite mountin and gets himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, he lets this go to his head. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� That line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldn�t have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns he believes he will never see anothe person again, he gets oledrar because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him. The setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die.	3	2		3																					
1292	3	When the cyclist is at his low point, he is an abandoned ghost town, looking for water that tastes like battery acid. The cyclist feels hopeless in the abandoned town. When he first reaches the water pump and the abandoned juice building he has a little hope only to be let down, because the building has no juice and the water pump�s water is too hot and the water is not any good. The setting is the reason his mood changes through out the story.	1	2		2																					
1296	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him thirsty and him thinking he is lost and going to die. The cyclist got information from an old guy that has not been off his porch for years. Just when the cyclist thought he was lost he saw �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp-if you want bait for the big ones, were your best bet!� The cyclist went in and got water, and the old man asked him if he wanted to know where to go, but this time he said no.	2	2		2																					
1297	3	"In the short story �Do not exeed the speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has great impact on the cyclist. In the begining of the story he describes the scenery as ""@CAPS1"". As he continued following the old mens out dated advice. It lead  him through more barren lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was �One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic� he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head"" he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called ""@PERSON2 and wilbers�s fish camp. ""This is where he drunk water and became repleshed. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist. Because depending on the location, decided weather he would live or die in the hot deserts of California."	2	2		2																					
1298	3	One of the main things that affect the cyclists is the heat. Due to the heat he drinks all of his water. Another feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the rough road since he is so tired he has a difficult time riding on the hills and other hard road conditions.	1	1		1																					
1299	3	In the story,� Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� written by the @CAPS1, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, �Flat roads was replaced by short, riding hills �@CAPS2 as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and care free and the land had no hills and he flat. However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure� tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me.� The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.    	3	3		3																					
1300	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affects the cyclist by draining him of energy, he is sweating so much, he keeps on drinking his water and slowly finishes it and still has a long ride ahead of him. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.�(Kurmaskie�s) since is was so hot the cyclist was thirsty and drank all of his water. It was a warm day and he needed to stay hydrated.	1	2		2																					
1306	3	All the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hoy out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips� and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke.	2	2		2																					
1307	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY DEPLETING HIS WATER SUPPLY, AND ALMOST GIVING HIM HEAT EXHAUSTION. IN THE TEXT, HE SAYS: THE WATER BOTTLES CONTAINED ONLY A FEW TANTALIZING SIPS.� THIS HOTNES HE HAS LITTLE WATER LEFT FOR SURVIVAL UNTIL HE RUNS OUT.	1	1		1																					
1311	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. @CAPS1 are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels,""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"" are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds."" A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" @CAPS1 are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story.   "	2	2		2																					
1312	3	The fetures in the settings like hills, make the cycleist use more energy, the more enegy that he uses the more water he will whant to drink. This is difficult because he states �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips�. Therefore he was in trouble.	2	2		2																					
1313	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he is in the desert and it is very hot outside. Also he is running out of water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because he�s pretty much dehydrated. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water. In conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way.	2	2		2																					
1317	3	The hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination. The sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination. �The sun was begining to beat down...wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.� By him being so hot and tired fromthe sun, he thought that he would die from dehydration. This would very likely stop him from making it to his destination, Yosemite. His lack of water supply didn�t help the situation either because he could only go @NUM1, was �water depleting @NUM2.�	2	1		2																					
1319	3	"The environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways. For instance if  you are hot, tree could be shade, or thirsty, a river neer by could help your thirst. If you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you this could make you hot. In this cyclist case the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads, �ghost towns, and trees. For example he said, �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barley noticed,� this is because of the ""cool pines"" around him as he explains in the next paragraph. It also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake, which added to his thirst. So then making it harder for him to go one. From reading the the text on can see how features can have effects on a person."	2	2		2																					
1321	3	The cyclist in the essay Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit feels discouraged and dehydration because of the setting. Near the beginning, after viewing the first stop which consisted of a few broke buildings and some rusted pumps he states �This sight was troubleing,� He also feels dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds the produce �A tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water�. Also as he is pedaling he sees a sign that says do not exceed 55 miles per hour. He	3	3		3																					
1322	3	In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions  of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels, � The  sun was beginning to beat down , � (Kurmaskie) .He is starting to get tired �because � it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June �. (Kurmaskie).Not only is he very tired and hot not where he is riding is barron and open and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. Through the passage you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cycler can change how and why how he does. 	2	2		2

1327	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him ???  are ??? like when he rood through that ghost town. The setting is a big part of this story thats all that talk about. And when hes getting water or how the tumbleweeds are crossing the road. He was all ways thirsty and rode his bike along ways and is no paint in ??? ??? ???.	2	2		2																					
1328	3	How the setting changes the mood of the cyclist is that what he sees pretty much discribes how he feels. Like he starts off with strong less and a smile on his face. Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town, that didn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it he laughs. Also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old men's direction giving. Like at the first town he still has confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that it starting to get hotter but that doesn�t change his mood much. @NUM1 miles later comes top a fork in road with rusty water pumps and a ran down car all that makes him less confidence in water level. Then he realizes the next town is a long way away so he losse more confidence and gets more worried about water. Then the flat road is replaced with rough road so his mood goes down more. Then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up. Here is how the setting affected his mood.	2	3		3																					
1329	3	The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke. Also his lack of water made him extreamly tired as he petaled. Next the sun was beating down so not only was he tired due to his lack of water but also because of it being so hot out he was loosing water and energy from his sweat. Thats why the features and setting made his journey to YoSemite difficult.	2	2		2																					
1330	3	In the short story, �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The cyclist experiences some difficult times. When starting the journey he had very little water. Because it was hot and dry his water went quickly leaving him very little water for the rest of the trip. The ragh roads also made him, tired making it harder to make the journey.	1	1		1																					
1331	3	Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are �the cool pines and rushing rivers� they affect the cyclist by keeping him cool and energized by the senery and the temperature, another is the juice factory and it was old and shut down showing that he would die alone. The goast town which was completely and utterly desserted showing that the place is barren and unlivible these are some of the features the affect the biker.	2	1		2																					
1335	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn�t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1�. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn�t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber�s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who �haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting.	1	1		1																					
1336	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.� Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California in deserts. Finally he sees bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all. Based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map. 	2	2		2																					
1337	3	The features in the setting affect cyclist in many ways. One of which is bring only to carry so much equipment which @MONTH1 be needed. For example, you can only take so much water with you and once you run out of there are no buildings or anything around that you are out of luck. Also, you can only take so much food. Finally, when you are ready to go to sleep you can�t just pull over you have to ride until you find a hotel or get home. I know that I would not make it. So those are just a few reasons on why the setting affects cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1338	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated, troubled, and relieved. The cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible heat. He says �the growing realie at von that l would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This means that the heat is a treat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and have heatstroke. The cyclist is troubled by the scarce sourroundings. ""a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule.� He is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. He had the �overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.� This means that that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it."	3	3		3																					
1339	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him in a way because he wouldn�t have to use strength and pedal as hard without having as much water in his body. When he came to a pump, it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid. The dryness of the dessert had a bad affect on the cyclist because he wasn�t able to get to the Yosemite water until the end. The breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down. The features of the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1342	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way could be if the setting was in, like, a place with a lot of water, then the cyclist wouldn�t have to worry about dehydration. Another reason would be if the old men were never outside in the first place, then none of this would have also happened.   	1	1		1																					
1343	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist physically. The want of the California desert canes the cyclist to became tired and dehydrated. For example the another states �I cased past, trying to keep my balance dehydrated star,� The setting is the main factory which causes the cyclist to become dehydrated.	1	1		1																					
1345	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder. In paragraph @NUM1; there is a senteance that says, �It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� In the next paragraph the cyclist comments, �sometimes life can feel so cruel.� @CAPS1 because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water and rolling hills are all obsticules in life, people have to experience. We might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful.	2	2		2																					
1347	3	The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. First in the story when describing the setting it says �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� @CAPS1 basically giving a hint or foreshadow that something bad is going to happen because hes alone. Another description of the setting when it affects the cyclist when it says �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� @CAPS1 pretty much saying danger ahead, something bad will happen.	1	1		1																					
1349	3	Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all. They showed the trecherous path he took the obstacles he had to surpass the prevail. The purpose of including some features of the setting like the poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, no signs of life, and no water all show and impact how bad the conditions were. If it left out these sectives the audience could say/think he was traveling through any old trail, for all they know the cyclist could be traveling along a windy river passing threw nice developed towns, so you see the features in the setting help set the mood and also reveal the confident of the story.	1	2		2																					
1352	3	There are many features of the setting that would affect the pedalists. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills �(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows the change of terrain. Hills must be traveled up to get to the other side and that takes much time and eneegy, especially for bike riders. �high deserats of California in June �(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows heat. Heat makes it harder for most people to concentrate and causes people to heat overheated when exerting much force at once. These two co	2	2		2																					
1355	3	In ''Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclist�s condition. For example, the author wrote �Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye� The way the author described the hill as �crippling� should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. Another quote that contributed to the cyclist�s journey was, �that smoky blues tune ''Summer time� rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.� This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him. I believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclist�s condition. I think the description of the setting enhanced the reader�s perception of the cyclist�s journey.   	3	2		3																					
1357	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all he is in the middle of no where, and he doesn�t know the direction of where he is going, and he also doesn�t know the people who live there. The other thing is that he doesn�t have a food, or a drink, so without eating or drinking he can�t get energy, so he can�t ride the bike.	1	1		1																					
1361	3	The features of the setting affected the cycles beceuse it was hot and was a mough train.	1	1		1																					
1363	3	The features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead� negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable.� When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid.� @CAPS1 feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly.� I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� He worned about heatstroke and his bodys need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed  and was not traveled often by people � crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.� As you can see, the cyclist was negatively afftected by the features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead.�	3	3		3																					
1364	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because if there is a rough road ahead your just going to have to be able and to handle the up and downs, bumps. The author was scared that he was gonna die and that the birds were gonna pick his bones clean.	1	1		1																					
1367	3	The cyclist does most really like the setting of the road. It�s messing up big time	0	0		0																					
1369	3	Some feature on the setting that @MONTH1 have affected the cyclist was the fact that he was running out of water and when he pumped water he said he pumped with all his strenght at first a tar like substance oozed out follwed by brackish water he said the water tasted of battery acid. Also in this setting the cyclist notices a terrain change flat road then turned short hills , follwed by a snake that looked od a diamond back.	1	1		1																					
1373	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist�s attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old mens directions he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delicious, the setting had added severly to the problem. The beating sun and high desserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he come to a rusted water pump �black tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions.	3	2		3																					
1374	3	The cyclist in �Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� starts off in the �serenity of an easly summer evening� taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn�t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his �short cut� was not so short after all. The �high deserts of California in June� and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he�d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a �Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.� @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  	3	3		3																					
1376	3	The features mentioned in the settings of the story made it harder for the cyclist. The lack of water during a summer in California  made it very uncomfortable for the cyclist to go through the deserts. The worst part was when he tried to suck the pebbles to cycle his saliva in his mouth, he ended up swallowing one.	1	1		1																					
1377	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation. The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with. 	1	1		1																					
1381	3	"The features of the start affected the cyclist by going listing to so dyhrate who have not left town pours in this instead of following his name got him going in the middle like the start sites on the sreach make right site at the ??.???? the what he steal inside that ""I reached myself riht then that I'd always asked to it????????? find on the last ?? is the bitter. this is said ?? he did not  ?? the sight and felt he walking not make, fall on the ?? and get dust stick. Did he ??? want to happen gian so be ?? to always look at the map.     "	1	2		2																					
1383	3	In the story the cyclist is on a bike ride to @LOCATION1. He has a new map is doing very well, until he asks these old men the best way to get there taking less time and by getting these faster a.k.a a short at. He takes there directions and feels good abut it. But soon things change, he experiences new terrain and it becomes much harder. The type of setting that he faces are steep hills, speed limits that he can�t exceed, dry hot temperature, and he has no water. All these features combine together to make the situation worse. While he is experiencing these things he feels like he is going to die and feels like giving up. But eventually he finds someone and doesn�t ask for directions. So the lession is don�t take directions from a stranger unless your willing to face the unexpected. 	3	2		3																					
1385	3	The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he�s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, �I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn�t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, �yes- sir: I own a very good map.� @CAPS2 by this he�s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he�ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed.	3	2		3																					
1386	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says �neihbor hood of two hundred degrees.� He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far.	1	1		1																					
1388	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, depending how the main character feels, that�s what the setting is like. When he got the next town and left he was feeling well because nothing was going wrong. The setting was very tranquil. The narrator says, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them�(Kurmaskie). This setting was very happy and pleasant just like the narrators mood.	1	1		1																					
1389	3	Some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replace by short, rolling hills. Then he came to a rough road. Another obstacle from the cyclist was the tar-like substance that came out the rusted water pump followed by brackish water feeling somewhere of @NUM1 hundred degrees. Everytime he pumped it wouldn�t cool down and the water tasted like battery acid. He was hitting his water bottle regularly that is why he needed new water. The cyclist was travelling through the high deserts of California and the sun was starting to beat down so he was dehydrated. The snake blocked the pavement in front of him that looked like diamond back.  	2	2		2																					
1392	3	"The cyclist a had rough time. The elements were against him. It was dry and hot and he had no water. In the text it says,""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. ""This shows that he had hardly any water, and what he did have would only make him thirster. ""@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. ""It was obviously not and the quote maker you visualize a desert or colorado. The man was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind. He was saving up his energy and his water. He was starting to go a little crazy. The hills were killer for him, in the text it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" This show you now rough the conditions were because he told us in the begining that he is a cyclist. The biker hell a very rough time and the setting definity effects this. "	2	3		3																					
1399	3	Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure riding a bike might be easy, but being a cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclist have many obsticles to over come while riding. One obstacle would be a rough terrain. Cyclist are used to riding on smooth, paved roads. Going off � road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge. In the short story �Do Exceed posted Speed Limit�, by Joe Kurmaskie also has another example for an obsticle cyclist have to be careful of, and that is running out of water, �I eased past, trying to keep by balance in my dehydrated state� (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is important when riding a bike. In conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead.	2	2		2																					
1401	3	"The feateres of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example ""not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. ""This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modem bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber� This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now hapy to have water and have reached his destination."	2	2		2																					
1402	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he saw �short, rolling hills,� tumbleweeds� and �a ridiculously large shake,� and he thought that he was not getting anywhere.	1	1		1																					
1404	3	The rider was affected by two men giving him wrong directions. The rider followed their advice instead of taking the right way he ended up taking the long way. He was getting very thribiy. He also came face to face with a snake. Then he finally found the nearest town in got help.	1	1		1																					
1405	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are. The hills that the cyclisit has to go over and the heat. The heat is making the cyclist sweat alot so he is loosing fluids and he starts to got dyhydrated. The hills are making him have to work harder and getting more tired.	1	1		1																					
1406	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They affected his confidence, his energy, and his determination. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident. This is show when he says.� The cool pined and rushing rivers of yosemite has my name written all over them. This shows confidence because he knows he can make it to yosemite.When he runs out of water he begins to lose confidence and thinks he way die. Since he ran out of water because of the heat, his energy is also dropped. You know he�s running out of water when he says.�The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, after lose of water and confidence; he actually had higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive. As you can see the cyclist was affected in many ways by the features of the setting.	3	2		3																					
1407	3	Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example in the oldmen that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever. Another example is: the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in @DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved	2	2		2																					
1409	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the sharp turns and the lonelyness it say in the text �About forty miles into the pedal. I arrived at the first town.�	1	1		1																					
1412	3	The conditions in the California desert were horrible for a cyclist. The temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry. The roads also had a lot of hills and when a cyclist has to use his energy in the heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard. There were also no stops to refill his water a long the way,which is bad because the neat,lack of water,and all of his energy extension leads to major dehydration.The conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous.	2	2		2																					
1413	3	The setting of the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limit� affected the cyclest greatly. He was riding through a desert in June. This meant that the temperature was very high. The narrator even states �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� @CAPS1 feature of the setting that affected him were the hills. He even calls them	1	1		1																					
1415	3	In �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie the main character faces a lot of trouble. First people give him the wrong directions. But, worst of all he has to travel a lot of mile on a bike through extreme temperatures. Going up and down hills and pedaling really hard. He doesn�t even have any cool water. As the character says, ��followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (kurmaskie @NUM1). That kind of water didn�t help him either. It didn�t quench his thirst because it was so hot, he said it tasted like battery acid. But, finally he worked up his confidence and kept pedalig till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool water. Then he headed off to Yosemite and didn�t take anyone�s advice.	3	2		3																					
1417	3	In the towns that the cyclist arrived at were all ghost towns. In the text, the author said, �it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� It affected the cyclist because, with the towns being deserted, the cyclist couldn�t refill hi water.	1	1		1																					
1418	3	The cyclist was motivated to get the job done. When they   said only �    eighteen miles down the road.� He thought it was going to be forever but he made it because he �conserved his water ...� and last kept on going, when the road   turned into a rocky gravel road, he still kept on going, but it was harder on his legs and water supply.	1	1		1																					
1419	3	The condition the cyclist are in calls for a lot of preparation. The cyclist was in a hot desert area with winding road and hills. The cyclist need to have plenty of water to make it where he is going, and, as read in the story, the conditions almost caused @CAPS1 health to the man who was trying to ride through.	1	1		1																					
1421	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had a couple of problems turning his journey little, amount of water, tough roads, including there were no cars on the road either. It all caused a lot of difficulty for the cyclist like on page @NUM1 paragraph one the first sentence �It didn�t really matter. In was going to die and the birds would pick me down� The elements were so tough on the cyclist that he or she was going to going to give hope. But luckly in the end the cyclist found a place to stop and get water with directions.	1	2		2																					
1422	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is trying to get water but when he tried the pump, �a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�. The cyclist doesn�t have any water so it is difficult to go on. He could suffer from heat exhaustion. As he came to the next town, he found, �the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant�. He is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1423	3	In the story there were many features of the setting tha affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is.   	2	2		2																					
1424	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. First is the emptiness, the feeling that he is all alone. Nor a car, person  or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone. That it would be along while before  anyone would be able to  find him. Nor that  might ecase some, But I think dalved him even more. It gave him that extra boost of energy that seems  to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of animal. The desert environment is very, unforgiving. The sun beats down like your only person on the plannet. The lack of water the food that it hasn�t rained in decades. The never ending, @CAPS1 road. The ups and downs and all the animals that await him. The fact that if he stops at all, ever, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment that is explained in the text has alot to do with the cyclist and affects him a great deal.  	2	3		3																					
1428	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesn�t have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. �This statement proves that the cyclist wasn�t a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that aren�t there, but you want to see those things. � I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. �It was a good decision that the cyclist didn�t get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful.	2	2		2																					
1429	3	"The features of the setting extremely affect the adjust in the ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the adjust the out of water but on top of that by faced, rolling wills, makes and hard road condition all of these setting played a huge will in the cyclist puformance, ""it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills."" He also says ""tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me. These setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride. He ran out of water no it was hard to reduce up will and the night of a deadly snake made the adjust named and worked to the difficulty of pufornenance for the cyclist"	2	3		3																					
1430	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist was like saying you are old and that you know nothing at all. But it is not true. It means you are older and that your information @MONTH1 not be correct for example in the essay when he was on his way to the town he learned to use his map instead of a guys opinion because the guy was wrong.	1	1		1																					
1431	3	The first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there. The next town wasn�t any better because it was @NUM1 miles down the road. The cyclist faced some problems while on the journey. Some of these problems included snakes - The fact that he wos running out of water- the hill-and the condition of the road.	2	2		2																					
1432	3	The features of the setting in �DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� affect the cyclist in a negative way. The terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling. Considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well, he begins to struggle. The author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as, tumbleweed, snakes and lack of water. The fact that the author is running out of water, makes continuing on a very stressful. He is worried that he will die of dehydration before he ever reaches Yosemite National Park. Finally, with much strength and determination, he reaches a fish a Fish camp. He is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on.	3	2		3																					
1433	3	The   features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot of dry place and has no water. He is pedaling up hills and that makes him even more tired. The dude is probably dehydrated and   his  conditions   are getting worse!	1	1		1																					
1435	3	During this bikers adventure heat and lack of water affect him. In this short story when the cyclist feels lost he says �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� This suggests that the rider was faced with the extreme heat of the desert during his ride. He also says �The water bottles contained only a few tantilizing sips.� This quote shows that not only was he faced with the heat, but also with lack of water. These facts and quotes show the clear threats this biker faced on his long bike-ride.	2	2		2																					
1437	3	The setting which is a desert in the summer affects the cyclist. For example, she caldn�t go as fast, �The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,� so that affected his ability to find water. The setting was also really hot, so the cyclist had a hard time getting the water he needed to keep going. For example, �I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn�t cool down.� @CAPS1 how the setting has got on to him, and he needs water badly. The desert setting also affects the cyclist mind. He believed he was seeing mirages and he was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump. The desert setting affects the cyclist ability to function.  	2	2		2																					
1439	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didn�t seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� He didn�t know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride.	3	3		3																					
1440	3	"The cyclist was riding in the hot, desert. This made him thirsties and less active. The story says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt."""	1	1		1																					
1441	3	My point of view that affect a cyclist that people need to recycle sometimes people is throwing away trash can with soda in side of it people cyclist now in days some times they need to change that role my conclusion people need to save stuff to make some new things to make a good quality world of cyclist things.	0	0		0																					
1443	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the �fork of sorts� as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn�t. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third ""obstacle"" he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still with a smile on his face."	3	3		3																					
1444	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist because of his enduranc. The amount of time he can ride without stopping, houever long he can ride up hill, how ever many bumps he rides over, however long he can ride without a drink of water.	1	1		1																					
1446	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by for the roads and heat has. He has tine ling through a desert in June which made it really hot for him, @CAPS1 that the road was bumpy and that made him have to pedal harder.  The @CAPS1 had to prit more effort into it because the romds here long and he had the spirit and determination to get to Yosemite. He @CAPS1 ran into a snake which told him that I am getting deeper into the desert.	2	2		2																					
1449	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope that the finishing line is not far and there was nothing in sight no cars, building or stucture of any kind.	1	1		1																					
1451	3	In the story the cyclist explains how the road goes from good to bad: An example,� Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit. Also the dry.	1	1		1																					
1460	3	Seting is one of the most important neds for a cyclist if the terrein or weather are bad, the hotter it is for a cylist its ?? ??	1	1		1																					
1461	3	The The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the cyclist @CAPS1 challenging porblem face by the author. Forexample, I nottice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had erected the first few things, a large highway. That�s shows when he arrived, the road does not good and also large highway high of jumped.	1	1		1																					
1463	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didn�t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found �several rusty pumps,� and �one ramshackle shed.� This probably didnt help him because he didn�t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn�t get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that �There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind� and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn�t setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story �Rough road ahead� the setting in the story didn�t help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didn�t help that he was in a desert.	3	3		3																					
1464	3	"Well since the cyclist is in a desert and out of mother he is probably not going to be happy. The ""ghost towns"" aren't really a boost of confidence either. The rugged hills made him angry too. The heat affected him the most."	1	1		1																					
1465	3	The features of the land affect the cyclist in the many ways. For example, the first two buildings that he came to were abandond so he could not get any food or water. Also, he noticed that the terrain was changing from flat to rolling hills and this will put more strain on his legs. Finally, the land was hot and dry wich was making him dehidrated. This is how the features of the land affected the cyclist. 	1	1		1																					
1466	3	In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink.	2	2		2																					
1469	3	I think the settings made it little more challenging to not letting give up also. Also shows that you do better in life when challenged.	1	1		1																					
1471	3	THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE �SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,� AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO EFFECT HIM A COUPLE OF WAYS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN �GHOST TOWNS� THAT CONSISTS OF �RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS� AND �SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS.� THESE FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL HOPELESSNESS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIN�T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED.  OBSTACLES SUCH AS �TUMBLEWEEDS� AND �PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES� ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVE ON THE �@NUM1 ROAD� ONLY DOING �12 MPH.� ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON.

1472	3	Topic: The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting affect a cyclist or the major problem that a cyclist encounter are some rough road, inspection of the bike, putting on necessary equipment, do not exceed posted speed limit For a cyclist to be doing all this I don think there is going to be any features of the setting affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to maintaining the speed limit of @NUM1 or a water-depleting @NUM2: sometimes life can feel so cruel. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much of speed but for them to be using the necessary equipment they won�t get seriously injured. Forget that old saying about never taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be �Never accept to	1	1		1																					
1475	3	The story that I am doing the most was going to talk about what happen in the story I was not shore but the name of the story sound prety good if I was in the story I not be good becaus the story is really crazy I would be realy good two start and right	0	0		0																					
1486	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was out of water in a desert like environment and their was no one ground for most of it so he was down on his own. The cyclist was affected when in the story when he says ''I got down on my hands and knees, working the water handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substaNce oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. That affected him because, he was drinking a lot of water before he got to that point in his trip and he was almost out so he needed to fill up with more but he did not have a place to get more water. That is one of the features of the setting that affected him.	1	1		1																					
1487	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated, getting tired, and by getting lost. After the cyclist was on the road for a while he had drank almost all of his water, but he still had a while to go before he got to his destination. He was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around. He also got tired because he was out in the sun, had barley any water, and he didn�t know where he was going. One last example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people. So if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired and getting lost were the features of the setting affect the cyclist had.	2	2		2																					
1489	3	Well if the setting relates to the theme then the story will make sence, like if it�s a sad story and it�s a ugly rainy day then it will match verry nice. That�s how the setting makes it better.	1	1		1																					
1495	3	In the story �Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limits,� The setting is a long road with �no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind he cyclist could be affected by the rough road that he have to ride down.	1	1		1																					
1496	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experience of bike riding in the desert. The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he �enjoyed the serenity of an eary-summer evening�. The word �serenity� gives the affect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the �ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule� in a ghost town that he meets in the desert. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating �Rough Road Ahead�. Kurmaskie�s confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low. Finally, kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a �rather modern bathroom� where he can stop to get a drink. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie�s confidence is followed by determination and then relief.	3	3		3																					
1497	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a dessert like place with a water surfage and he could hard tired. I would never have asked old people, he should have ask someone that was in charge of a store, because those people get asked many times. also he could have died if that snake got him or from what he said �heatroke.�	1	1		1																					
1501	3	"The settnig can greatly effect the cyclist. The palce can change what happens and how it happens. For example if the story had taken place in alaska the cyclist would not have had, ""Wide rings of sweat circling my shirt."" and instead have been fighting off hypo thermia. The setting is very important because it affects all of the details in the writing. "	2	2		2																					
1503	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� For example, he finds a �ramshackle shed� and tries to find water. It affected him, because it says, �I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� The quote meaning that he was determined to find water and perhaps anything.	1	1		1																					
1504	3	The setting affected the cyclist by depriving him of hydration and weakening him. The large hills and rough roads ebbed away every bit of his strength and wore him down. The narration states, �Over one long, crippling hill� (kurmaskie @NUM1). This work choice reflects the writer�s feeling about his adventure. Words like �long� and �crippling� show that the trip was a horrible experience.	1	1		1																					
1505	3	Pride, determination, relief � all are things that the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. First the cyclist started of rideing on fresh legs and good directions, but after a while down the road he started to dought the old men, �a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their been a sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it.� After feeling that the direction might be rough, he rode out of pride to get to his destination. Next the rider had great determination to get to his destination and did many things, �I gathered � a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst.� This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going. Finally the cyclist was fatigue when he arrived at the @CAPS1 shop because he then knew the old men were right and would reach his destination, �As I stumbled into rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink this quote shows he was polite naturally to get water but to know the men were right.	2	3		3																					
1508	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. The setting affected the cyclist performance. For example, the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened for instance, the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of. Again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. For example, the river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water. In conclusion, the setting had a major affect on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1509	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, a lot of the settings discoured the cyclist. �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. As soon as the cyclist hits this �town� he realizes that the old mens advice might not have been so great. The dry desert affects the cyclist the most. This hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirst, hot, and and sweaty. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke...� The cyclist's tune here is sarcastic but he is still concerned about his health because of the heat and lack of water. The fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him. Since he�s talked to the old men for directions he hasn�t seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything. So this definetly discourages the cyclist and makes him lose his will to continue his journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. 	3	3		3																					
1510	3	The cyclist traked through a barren land trying to get to a land of rivers and valleys. Trakling through the first town the cyclist saw a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps and corral lotated in the desert of California. The cyclist was very angry that the old men led him into this barren town, however he kept hope and traveled to the next town. Their, he found a abandond fruit juice factory and bottling plant, how the discuraged the cyclist started to give up. �I was going to die,� he clamed with all hope loot. The man feels like their is nothing left and it�s the old men who caused this. Then finally, he cme across a bait shop which he found an his own giving him a huge reliefe. The features effects his attitude because in a baren land you lose hope as did the cyclist. Therefore, what�s around us affect us as in education, friendship, and survival.	2	2		2																					
1512	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie show that as the day goes on the cyclist becomes tired and wornout from his long ride through rough terrain trying to find his way back home then he saw some buildings down a hill and said �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill� (kurmakie @NUM1). After the rider gets home he says he is going to do it again.	2	2		2																					
1514	3	The affects of the settings was how hot it was and the cyclist road he was on. The rider said it was June in the summer time, very hot. And the roads were not smooth, the were very old and ragady.	1	1		1																					
1516	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is tRying to bike up hills and down hills, which can be very tiRing. Also, the hot aiR can dehydRate him, which can cause him to pass out. Along with the dRy aiR, theRe is dRy land, which means theRe is no place to stop foR wateR oR take a @CAPS1. The Rough @CAPS2 make the biking naRaeR because it involves moRe eneRgy than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the  middle of the Road made it haved foR the bikeR to go aRound. If the snake would have bitten him he could have died fRom poison.	2	2		2																					
1517	3	"The setting in the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very hot in dry, very little shade or moisture, at some point maybe even none at all. This whether affected the author because he had no water at all so he was getting more dehydrated the further he went."	1	1		1																					
1518	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The feature was that you should never take advice from old people that never get out of the house. For example in the story it says, �Never accept travel advice from collection of old. times who haven�t left confines of their porches since carter was in office.� This affecting the setting because if it weren�t for his map and let them take a peek at it, That would of saved him a load of trouble.	1	1		1																					
1519	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting of the terrain was hot and water draining. In the text it says �Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees� this proves that the cyclist is exagerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says �I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.� This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out. In conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best. 	2	2		2																					
1521	3	Usally the features, setting has an major affect upon the cyclist. The features, setting relates, and describes the hassh, and eventually relief condition of the cyclist. The setting relates to the person and plays a role, which the cyclist can observe. One reason how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is it shows the various problems that are being faced with the cyclist. For example, the cool pines, no one in sight, and I am alone. The way how this interepts a clear meaning, I the cyclist needs help getting home, and eventually by traveling, he needs water, to fill his thirst. Prior to thisy, the features, shows the weakness of the cyclist. For example, with that i believed it was my last burst of energy, as I consently, maneuvered down the hill. The features, and settings, affect the cyclist by showing how he was facing his troubles, thirst and fear, which all lead behind him at the end. These features and settings develop a clear understandmet, for the cyclist, and what is to be expected, in by him.	3	2		3																					
1523	3	"In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride he talked about the struggles he had to face. when he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He choose to take their advice but later regreted it. when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns. ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""He dose eventually reach a town were he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite, the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was pleged by the sun and lack of watrer. The sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water. when he rached his last few sips he resisted from drinking it and began loosing consciesness. ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."""	3	2		3																					
1524	3	A cyclist can only travel as fast as slow as he pedals. If the setting is a humid sunny day he can�t go to fast due to his lung capacity. If it is a warm but windy day he has to wath his speed to keep from getting hurt. Basically unless the weather is nice or safe enough he will go fast. But his safty care first so it depend on the weather mostly but also the time of the day. If it is night [dark] the reflectors must be put on to keep from getting it.	1	1		1																					
1525	3	The features in the setting affecting the cyclist because of the heat and the terrain. I say this because in the story it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down with the herendous heat beating down on him. The heat also makes it hard because it makes you drink more and throughout the story he was trying to find some water, and the water he did find was about �two hundred degrees and tasted like a battery acid.� If you have no water that makes it very hard to bicycle that far of a distance in that much heat.	1	1		1																					
1526	3	The cyclist is affected by many features in the setting. the long hill is one example the snake and the dirt road are two more. The heat of the desert is another and his depleting water supply are all examples of features that affected him.	1	1		1																					
1529	3	The setting affects the cyclist by wanting to go longer and riding the bike. And to see what is up ahead. By riding a bike in the heat, you can have a heat stroke and die from dehydration and the heat. That�s why you are supposed to have a lot of water with you when you are riding a bike.	1	1		1																					
1533	3	The cyclist �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was definatly affected by the setting. He was cycling in California - which is a hot place to begin with - in June - which made it even hotter coming upon a hot desert. When you�re doing a physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get hot and he was out of water. This affected his body by making him tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself. Then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice. He said �In an ironic twist abandon years earlier had been a Welch�s grape juice factory and bottling plant.� He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant. The cyclist was definatly affected by his surrondings both mental - by saying �I�m going to die.� - and physically by becoming dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
1534	3	The cyclist was riding in some rough, dry and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. He described it as, �In the high deserts of California in June.� It was dry, lifeless and hot The sun was beating on him and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out. The empty towns were what he was wanting on for fresh water, but they�d been very abandoned. This made his journey very dangerous. He could�ve fallen off at any time because of heat stroke He would�ve died right then and there. His sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. He had to enhance these extreme. Ironical conditions for miles on end, just to find some water. It was all that a desert is and all that a home shouldn�t go through.	2	3		3																					
1535	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in manyway. The hills are to long. Every town is fear appert and the rodes are rought. The heat also affectes him. He is affected health wise.	1	1		1																					
1537	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist  greatly. The features is old abandon towns and hot temperatures. Also abandoned buildings. This makes the cyclist think All hope is lost. The essay says this �Over one long crippling hill, a bulding came into view [...] I hung my head that smoky blues tune ""summertime rattle around."" Then to a happy mo In an ironic twist that should please all sadist reading this, the building [...] by the looks  afit had been a welch�s  grape Juice factory and bottling plant [...] I hung my head that smoky bluees tune sumertime rattle around.� Then to a happy mood it states �As I stumbled into a ra ther modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, i had a overwhelming  urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.""  "	2	2		2																					
1539	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, �no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,� he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to �short, rolling hills�. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed �crippling�, My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience.	2	3		3																					
1540	3	Excitement, desperation, and self-pitty are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite park because of it peacefulness. He said, �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name.� He wanted to get their because it was so hot. He started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of this hot water hole. �I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid.� He was running out of water so he got desperate for some. He started to have self-pitty on his self,� sometimes life can be so cruel,� he was feeling pitty on himself because he had such a long way to go still. These are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting.	2	2		2																					
1542	3	The way the feature of the setting affected the cyclist is that  its in June in the middle of the desert. Also he was given wrong	1	2		2																					
1543	3	The cyclist was affected by the climate, the people, and the surrounding. The climate was the desert in June which was very hot with little water. This made him dehydrated and miserable. The old men that �helped� him acused think to be in the guiding situation he was in. There were no surrounding shop or buildings that were inhabined. This way there was no place for him to get any water nouroushment.       	2	2		2																					
1548	3	From reading the story, l believe the setting of the desert he was cycling affected him immensly. I believe it affected him in the way his attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. At first he was very motivated, determined, and hydrated. As time and miles went on the scenery mover changed.That can be really hard. in heated water or, you need to be as hydrated ad possible, especially it an enduring in physical activity. When time he went on, he was getting low on water and had nothing in think about a long other them, how much larger, how thirsty he was  and is this worth it? It is a lot eager to the motivated when there is thing to look at to keep your mind of the attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. In my point of view strongly believe that it could have been form working at the some sandy desert for seeds a long period of time. I have ??? ??? ??? in exercising while making on  ???. It�s hard to see  ??????????? thing. My attitude will go farm.� I�m so determined to I�m bored � to� what�s the point.� But I thought it was great how he never gave up ??? things got bad. It opened my eyes to see how great it is to reacts your own goals.        	2	2		2																					
1549	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, �I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.�  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him."	1	1		1																					
1552	3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, run�down @ORGANIZATION1 factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is not and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads. He is running low on water and at the one town he finds the water from the pump is undrinkable. The features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason hid health is at risk.  	3	3		3																					
1553	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. @NUM1 way is the condition of roads. Another is the heat. Another is snakes. Another is no town insight. The final one is lack of info. @MONTH1 be the guy made it. @MONTH1 be he got hurt on the ride.  Maybe a snake bit him. Either way, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.   	1	1		1																					
1558	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist, because as his surrondings changed he lost hope of making it to Yosemite National park. Such as when he was riding through his first town and it looked abandoned he wasn�t so sure if he shold keep going. As well as when he didn�t see anyone or any buildings he got worried and was wanting to lose hope. But  as second road sign appeared he was relieved.	2	1		2																					
1559	3	The setting in this short story cause the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack there of. The cyclist has no water and thinks it�s only a matter of time before he dies. Another big problem is the rough terrain. The rough terrain is hard for the cyclist to overcome. Also, there is no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him. Until he finds the bait shop, if anything would have happened to him, there would�ve been no one there to help.	2	2		2																					
1562	3	The author finds the desolate and harsh settings to be not discouraging, rather they stand out as a cause of amusement and fun, quest-like tests. The author writes that after arriving at his first ghost-town, he chuckles, amused by the funny �old codgers� and their crazy ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isn�t the least bit established anymore, he�s slightly disappointed, but sees it as �a test of [his] inner spirit.� At the third building an abandoned factory he still appreciates the irony of the situation. While biking across the desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and instead uses it as a point of reference to work his progress and as a way to push himself. Though the author is faced with empty disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing 	1	1		1																					
1563	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead: do not excess speed limit, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier, and as the cyclist travels and limits are being pushed his outlook is somewahat grim he only expects the worst. The rough road strats out after a water pump he finds gives him piping not, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor to his life, and is the source for him living. In the beginning he drank it regularly and when he gets to the pump it is bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself. The cyclist in this story is very a ware to how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration. At one point he says �and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porches in a decade"" he later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly the lack of humans and their technology really broke him down."	3	3		3																					
1564	3	The desert is the crulest of nature�s environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert�s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.� If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, � I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. �As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, �the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear�.	3	2		3																					
1565	3	"The features in the setting of the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do not exeed the Posted Speed limit� affect the cyclist in a cruel manner. The old man say that the towns are going to be there and they are just not functioning towns. To make the cyclist feel hopeless the setting puts him in a California day in June which is extremely hot and puts in all these unexpected twists. A cruel thing to add in the essay was when it read �The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mph� This lowers the cyclists confidence making him seem more worried. Another cruel thing is the author adding a welch�s Grape Juice factory that had been abandoned with �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring @NUM1 refreshing glass of juice into his mouth"" totally causing him to lose hope left. These features in setting are cruel."	3	3		3																					
1567	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	1	1		1																					
1568	3	This essay takes place on a barren desert landscape.The setting being very hot causes him to get dehydrated faster. Also fones are scarce. In this place as he says sometime into free essay, �the negg down was only @NUM1 down the road. This place also caused him to question what he saw thinking it might be just a mirage.	1	1		1																					
1571	3	The setting affected the cycist because it made his ride harder. For example, the weather was extremly hot. �The sun was beginning to beat down.� He says it didn�t affect him, yet he was very thirsty and dehydrated so internally it affected him. Also, the weeds and snakes frightened him. �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� This could not of made his ride easier. Next the hills and roads, �over one long, crippling hill.� This proves how intense his ride was. Thats how the setting affected the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie.	1	2		2																					
1573	3	The settings effects the cyclist because in California it could be really hot sometimes. The cyclist could dehydrate on a long trip and pass out really get hurt. Also there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1575	3	The cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� had to go through a hard time in the California desert.  It was hard for him because it was very hot in the desert in June. That he was almost out of water; at first his ride was easy on flat ground. But when he came to rolling he had to use more energy and ???.	1	1		1																					
1576	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier. Finnally there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet.	2	1		2																					
1577	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by old people changing the definition of adon�t talk to strangers. The main character	1	1		1																					
1579	3	"The setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist. The hot deserted surroundings made the cyclist become tired or discoveraged. For example the cyclist observes, ""one ramshacure shed, several rusty pumps, and a comes that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was trouble."" This quote shows the old, beat down environment worried him. Also the author says, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" In this quote, the cyclist realizes his isolation, and begins to become more determined to reach his destination. Realize, ever been lost, then youknow that it can be discouraging if there's no sign of life around you. All you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way. This feeling is shown through the cyclistand now the setting around him affects his journey."	2	3		3																					
1580	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of them is that it was in the daylight and the sun bothers the cyclist. Another one is that because there was nothing around him, he felt frustrated. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� If something were there, he wouldn�t feel frustrated and at least he would have more hope to find something. 	1	2		2																					
1582	3	When riding a bike for a very long time with no water is bad but is even worst when your surroundings are worst. For example, when the cyclist has no water it is a day with nothing around him to help. Also with no water he could pass out & get dehydrated. When he finds no one to help & nothing around him he sucks on a pebble to keep his mouth hydrated. Therefor you should always check you destination on a bike before just going for it.	2	2		2																					
1586	3	The setting of �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed Limit� effects the cyclist in many was. The words �high deserts of California in June,� from the story show that it is very hot and dry. The cyclist get's very tired and in the desert there aren't big ponds to get water out of, so if you don�t have water you don�t have anything. Also the cyclist suffers the pain a difficulty of having to drive on, over and down rough terrain. In the story it is said there was a sign that said �Rough Road Ahead.� There were also obsticals such as tumbleweeds and snakes he had to get around. The dry, rough, dangerous setting put the cyclist life in danger, but because of dedication he got through it.	2	2		2																					
1589	3	The features effect the setting of the story in a big way. At the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the @NUM1 town there is no one around. There are no buildings in site at all and no source of water. Since there was no one around his confidence of actualy completing the trip begar to go down. Once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore. This made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought hed never make it and that he die. Once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water. The setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence.	3	2		3																					
1595	3	There are many different features such as the weather, road condition, and how the person is feeling. The weather can effect if it is rain or weather the road are messed up he could get a flat. The way that the person is feeling is a big part on weather they try hard or they do not worry about it too much.	3	2		3																					
1599	3	In the story, do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist was affected about the road ahead. He took advice that he thought was right but it was wrong. So it took him off track of his good he was trying to reach	1	1		1																					
1604	3	The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the �towns� around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. 	2	1		2																					
1605	3	The features of the settings effects the cyclist by many reasons such as; dehydration, the road my cause bike to stop working. Since there is a lack of water in the dessert it seems, the guy could get dehydrated easily. The intense heat can cause that to. The road that he is riding on my cause the tires to pop.	1	1		1																					
1608	3	"The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand. Specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing like after @NUM1 miles to a town then @NUM2 miles passed that he, �came to a park of ???. One ramshackly shed, several rusty pumps and  a carrol that couldn�t hold in the hamest mule greeted me.This sight was troubling.� Then he went in a discharge, ""I was traveling strenght the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 ?? imagine, the heat, and unbareabalnes of the ??? journey still I face. @CAPS1 that bike seen endless.Then with a thrust gaining on him for example, ""I was doing a water-deplety 12 mph, sanctures life can seen be cruel. ""@CAPS1 him feel his constrain regrate on the journey @CAPS1 me feel his constrain sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. Another example is, ""I riped the sweat from my eyes to make sure I wasn't a mirage"". Then, reaching this, the building abondoned years ago. @CAPS1 his journey seen hopeless and long had that make endless with first wave problems getting strength at him @CAPS1 his journey seen to be harder and filled with ?? hope as strenght left to finish his goals."	3	3		3																					
1612	3	The cyclist was is a horrible nasty environment for cycling, but the thing that really threw the cycle off was running out of water. There were no houses to refill his bottle or no one around to give him updated directions. From the heat made him drink more water and also harder to breath in extreme heat. Without those faults the cyclist would have been fine.	1	1		1																					
1614	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. They affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains. Also because he didn�t follow his plan on the map he had no cloe where he was and so I think the anxiety of the whole thing took a toll on his physical well being. It affected him mentally because every town he passed through, or every building he passed was deserted and he had no idea where any people were so that had to stress him out. This mentally messed him and he thought he was going to die, thats not good for anyone. I really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore. Maps don�t go crazy and they don�t really get outdated, and maps don�t lie to you so he obviously learned his lesson.	2	2		2																					
1615	3	Some of the features like the change in landscape affected the cyclist. Differing from flat land to miniture hills to highways is kind of hard to cope with, especially considering he was dehydrated and had no water.	1	1		1																					
1617	3	"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is �This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June �(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)�. The hotness and heat had also increased the character�s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is �I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I�d be fine �(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."	3	3		3																					
1618	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water. another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down. lastly when he rehydrated himself in the  so the setting was a main factory to the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite national park."	2	1		2																					
1620	3	The setting affected the cyclist mood in the story. The cyclist was riding rough terrain and rolling hills. This made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless. When the cyclist arrived at the abandoned @CAPS1 Grape Factory he felt on twist of many. He was extremely thirsty and there used to be a @ORGANIZATION1 build there when the cyclist was a the fock in the road, he thought he could get some water. When this failed the cyclist was even less determined. He felt like the world was against him.	2	2		2																					
1621	3	The settings effected the cyclist, because where ever he went it seem to never end. Like when he was riding along where the old men told him to go. He went through a ghost town like they said he would go through a town. Then he kept on going but it never end and the summer heat started to get to him. Like when he started to dehidade he this old juice factor and started imagening that he was drinking juice. So he started seeing things.	1	1		1																					
1622	3	As the author cycles through this shortcut, he is in a very dangerous setting. As said in the poem, he is in the high deserts of California in June. A desert makes the heat unberable for the cyclist. Its just sun, sand, and him. Then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about @NUM1 almost maybe even hotter. This could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply. �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� Then there is the distance of his ride. The author is always saying �About @NUM2 miles� or �Twenty miles up the road.� All of this hard work can cause heatstroke & kill him.	2	2		2																					
1623	3	The features of the setting like the dessert the sun and abondered towns affect the cyclist alot. The dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever. And probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town. The sun makes hime even  hoter not  he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty.The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever doing to make to yosomite. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy. He is content after riding to the first town but then the rest of time towns are abandoned too and start to ran out of water an he thinks he is going to die which makes it sad. Then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop an finds water.	2	3		3																					
1624	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively. The story takes place in June in California. This is a very hot time of the year in such a desert location. The heat adds to the speed at which the cyclist becomes dehydrated, as well as his inability to think as coheratly as he could had he not been in a desert in June. The cyclist is also travelling through desolate, an inhabited land. The author says, �There was no one in sight, not a building car, or structure of any kind.� This emphasizes the characters total lack of resources. There is nowhere within sight that he can turn to for help, water, food or shelter. The road was also rough, plagued with many rolling, crippling hills. Such terrain is much harder to manuver, especially in such a are state of despair. The setting of the story, ""Rough Road Ahead"" greatly impacts the cyclist."	2	3		3																					
1625	3	There are a lot of things that effect the cyclist, such as the heat, having no water, the rough roads and the long trip. The cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot. The narriation says, �and the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated. The roads were very rough, for example, �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The roads became, bumpy, and there were a lot of hill the cyclist had to go over. There was no water either. So he/she was running out of energy and it made it even harder. In the end the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water.	2	2		2																					
1626	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization. The narrator said, �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his llife. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesn�t have making him dehydrate faster. The narrator saids, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of made it so much worse that he had no water.	1	1		1																					
1629	3	There are many affects of the setting in this eassy that, that can be good and or bad. The setting is alone on a empty mountain road, with no house, no cars, no people. In now going to give you some good and bad effects. One good effect is that you by yourself so while you exercise you can relax and enjoy the energy. One bad thing is that what if you pop a tire or need help. You stock because theirs no one around. Another good thing is that you being by yourself, @CAPS1 any cars. You don�t have to worry about getting hit so you�ll be able to just relax and enjoy the ride . Another bad thing is there is no water so you might want to bring plenty with you. So whatever you decide to do just be careful and think you idea thought  	1	1		1																					
1630	3	The setting or environment the cyclist was in made him feel isolated from the rest of the world. He knew the was no turning back once he started his adventure. No one was their to help him. The environment made him to realize the many risk involved in this adventure. The knowledge that there is no help was his motive to continue on his long journey.	1	1		1																					
1632	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affects the cyclist because he has to cross different types of land marks. First, he got information from the old people. For example, when he showed the map to the old people their only going to know the old short cuts not the new ones. Second, when he ran out of water. For instance, when the cyclist ran out of water he had to climb hills and that tired him out. Plus when he tried to get water from that one thing only hot water come out last, when he finally got to a story the old guy had a map. For example, when he asked the old guy about the place he was going to he said I have my own map. So therefore he knew he was in trouble. In  conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1633	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. The setting was verry hot and there were a lot of hills. The cyclist had been riding up and down hills all day and it took a lot of energy when he saw the building that he thought could help him he said, �... last burst of energy, i mane'uvered down the hill,� By saying that it showed that the setting of where he was contained a lot of hillsy and they effected him by taking up all his energy. That is how the setting had effected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1634	3	"In the short story Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted  Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affects the cyclist. When at the old codgens house, he is confident in himself, because they have told how of a shortcut to Yosemite, giving that confidence he needs, as he leaves, he is still confident, these as the settings changes, so does the mood of the cyclist. after ""about @NUM1 miles into te pedal"", the cyclist arrives at the first town, he has despair because it is a ghost town,"" still having confidence, he lack of water, he continues on. after a couple more miles, he comes to small fork with a pump. Thinking its cool, water he goes and pump, he finds out it is @NUM2�@CAPS1 and tastes like ""battery acid"". Now he desparate, no water, dehydrated, and no towns around, he began to pedal and pedal, hoping to find a town around. When he does find a town, with water, the setting to relieving and better for him because he find water. In the end, the setting effect how the cyclist back against confident, then desperate as water is used, than relieved when water is found."	3	3		3																					
1636	3	The effect of cyclist is very and treding becose alot of thing can go worrs like you can feel so hot have and water wouldn�t cool down it didn�t matter. But when drop in you mouth had the flavor of battery acid. He or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeus day in June. So hot that you are seeing thing like a town hot pouring a refeshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave.  	1	1		1																					
1637	3	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, �This sight was troubling�I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.� With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called �easy way out.� 	1	1		1																					
1638	3	In the story the setting affected the cyclist all through the story till he arrived at body and wilbers fish camp. As the man rides his bike for a while he is of but as he road into the first town it seemed to be a ghost town. As he pedal on � The sun was beginning to beat down but I barely noticed it�. At that time the wheater is affecting him a lot but he keeps Yosemite cool pines and rushing rivers in his head He also only had only a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottle while going up a big hill.	2	1		3																					
1641	3	Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, �That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� Because it was hot. This could make the cyclist thirsty. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion. We know their were many hills because in the text it says.� Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� Going over all those hills can really tire someone out. A third feature of te setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake. This making it dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during @DATE1, not June.	3	3		3																					
1648	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting affects the story very much for many reasons. First, it is in the summer, so it is very hot. Also, it is in the desert in the west, so there is a very warm climate already. Third, there is not any civilization on the �shortcut� he follows, so there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	2		2																					
1649	3	The setting affects the cyclist a lot, because is it was windy too it would be had for the cyclist to control the bike. So is  too has a lot as buildings and people outside their would be a lot as traffic so they would not  be allowed to let the cyclist go there so the cyclist would  has to turn back. Then if it was a clear road  and nobody was there ad no bulidings or houses were there then it wold be an easy ride for the cyclist. So as you can see the setting affects the cyclist in many ways.	0	1		1																					
1650	3	The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water, the cyclist was absolutely fine. As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct.	2	2		2																					
1651	3	If it�s a good day the cyclist will want to rid. If it is a bad day then they will not want to but probably will.	3	3		3																					
1653	3	The features for the cyclist in rough road ahead is not the kind l�D  war a be in at forts. I thought it was going to be  a scenery story but it turns out he want that prepared. He took directions from some olden guys who haven�t left their house sense carter was in office. He was a bike peddaling threw the California desert with the things you can carry cause your on a bike. He ran out of water and could of got heatstroke or colapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite. The conditions this biker is in  hormone and I dont think he was prepared. Always stick in your gut.	3	2		3																					
1654	3	In the story the fact that no one was around, there were no buildings, he had no water, and was lost. Had a negative affect on the cyclist, he was doubting himself the whole time. Although he did perserver and made it through the tough situation he was in.	1	1		1																					
1655	3	In the story �rough road ahead� the setting and the features affect the cyclist. For example in the story he says �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate�. This shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperatly thirsty unless it was very hot out. The setting and features of this story is it takes place in California, on a hot day. Another quote that could support the question is when the author says, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage.� This shows that it is hot because he is sweating. This also could show that it is hot because he thinks it�s a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot.	2	2		2																					
1656	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, the as the cyclist rode on for the first miles, he did not see anything in sight. This made him less determined to reach his goal. Then, in paragraph @NUM1, the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal. The cyclist�s determination went down as long as he was riding. But then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself.	2	1		2																					
1658	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about. After the ride didn�t turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to �set in�. The aridity of the climate would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with but the scorching sun would make him become dangerously dehydrated.	1	2		2																					
1660	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� has a great effect on the main character in the story. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first �town� and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him. �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.� His mood at this point was already confident, but this adds to it, with words like �rushing� being encouraging to him. Then, he continues moving on the road. �Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.� At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isn�t what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. �This adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him. Then he said �over the long crippling hill, a building came into view.� It is at this point that he uses the word �crippling� because he is just about exhausted and can�t go any further.	2	2		2																					
1663	3	The location of a cyclist�s ride affects the person�s attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst.The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked �brackish.� So, setting can break a cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1666	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the good way. For examples he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport. He would be rich because he would win the contest of cycling.	0	0		0																					
1667	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie many obstacles are caused from the diffrent settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled � I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. � This caused the loss of determination, which led to him lossing his consciousness. The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually  make him lose consciousness. He said � if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time.�  	2	1		2																					
1671	3	There are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. One reason is because it is so hot, I know this because it was sammertime in the California desert. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the sign that he saw that said �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1). This tells you that the road is very rough. And being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from. There is no one around to give him a drink of water. These are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1672	3	The setting of this story is outside. Yosemite is outside riding her bike. She is around hills, no water, and very hot land. You know that she is around hills because she says to herself, �� I maneuvered down the hill.� You also know that she starts of around no??? ???good water. �When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid�� that shows the water was bad. Also the land is very hot because it says ��in the??? ???of two hundred degrees.� Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemite�s biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid. 	1	1		1																					
1673	3	There are many things that could affect affect the cyclist. Like when they said ,� tomble weeds crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake.� @CAPS1 her example would be when they said� Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1674	3	"The stoy of the cyclist features of the setting affect of the cyclist, The cyclist had to go thoug a lot "" The speed limit was @NUM1. The was doing a water depleting @NUM2, Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� The cyclist love ride their bike they enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening"" to cycling."	1	1		1																					
1676	3	The older men gave him directions that were acctully really bad. Nature wasn�t on is side that�s for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the heat. Secondly a snake blocked his path and he didn�t want to tempt it. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. Also he kept going to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat, he was then lead to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way of getting home.	2	1		2																					
1677	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, �These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,� If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I�m glad the cyclist didn`t. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him.	2	2		2																					
1678	3	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, �That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office�. This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who haven�t left their homes in years.	2	2		2																					
1679	3	The setting of the desert is a hard setting to be in with no water or help. If the author would have been on a population trait with water fountain and shade, he would have been fine. But, he was in the desert no one around, hot, dry, no water, and no shade. �tumbleweeds crossed my path� (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This dicride his loneleness because no one was in the desert to help him. The setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp. The setting had a huge affected on the author.	2	2		2																					
1681	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the author faces many obstacles because of the different terrain changes on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclist�s physical state, but his mood and determination as well.  "	3	2		3																					
1682	3	"The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. ""The journey nass make an snake this quote and that there made it seem like he is in the middle of know were and is ulcoming no plass because the man on the pourch said it would not be to far. The first town also was empty and when saw the town he was excited to go and feel a little out when he got closer he realized that the town has been abandoned this whole time so he was forced to keep going out the empty town made him feel almost hopless. In his attempts to make it to that next town, that how the setting mos affected the cyclist in the way that it did."	2	2		2																					
1685	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date. �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confine of their porches since carter was in office,� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt to pleased. Therefore the cyclist went through some though times.	1	2		2																					
1686	3	Different features of the settings affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is based in the desert has a negative affect on the character. �The desert land is baron, leaving him only with his small supply of water. During his journey he runs out of water causing him to lose contact with reality. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his trip. To his dismay, it turns out to be a no more than a mirage. The lengthy road also affected the trip. The length and roughness of the road had worn the cyclist down.	1	1		1																					
1687	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, �The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water�� He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn�t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing.	3	3		3																					
1689	3	You came alway choose your features because you idea mind be change over time.	0	0		0																					
1690	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist mentally, physically, positively and negatively. For instance, had been do @CAPS1's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy by pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still been seen."" This affected the author mentally, making him remember he had no water. Which inturn affected him physically by becoming dehydrated as moments passed. So overall that setting features had a negative direction affect on the cyclist. Another example, ""One ramshacked shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling."" This affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again. It also affected him physically because the water tasted like ""battery acid"" which put him deeper into his dehydration state. This setting features had a negative affect on the cyclist. The setting features and had they affected the cyclist is like an environment a person is adised in and how it makes them who they are."	3	2		3																					
1691	3	He is going on a journey on his bike. He has to go down hills and deal with the factt that has has no water. That�s basically what the setting is about.	3	2		3																					
1697	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed� by @PERSON1, the cyclist faces problems caused by the setting. The biker was riding and the heat was scourching and the biker was really getting dehydrated and tired and he was running out of water. Because it was so hot the biker had to drink more water to replenish his body of all the sweat he was loosing while biking. The hills of the terrain were making it harder on the biker by making him us more energy and liquid to keep going. If it had been cool and breezy he would have had no problem making that distance. If the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns than he would have had water to drink.	1	1		1																					
1698	3	"Every body experiences physical and emotional pain, but most probably wouldn't have survived what the cyclist in this story went through. The man started a bike ride Yosemite National park, but when some eldrerly men told him a short cut, his adventure had just because. First at all, every ""town""and ""building"" the men told him he would come to, would come to, wound up being completely desserted. At first this wasn't a big deal to the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph when he came to his first desserted town he, ""chuckled, checked [his] water town supply, and moved."" @CAPS1, as his journey progressed, his water decreased.He was then in desperation for a town.On topof thatin the story he wrote, ''the tast roadwas replaced short, rolling hills. ""This made his biking harder and he was then becoming denyarated. He finally found a town with water, but learned his lesson from taking advice from strangers and old men. "	3	3		3																					
1699	3	"The features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot. There is a man who takes the advice of old men and takes a �shortcut� to Yosemite Park. The shortcut only leads him to thirst, and no park. The narration states, �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth couldstill be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""This feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him. the cyclist comes to the first �town� but only finds yet again no water, and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey. Another feature that @MONTH1 affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back. The narration states, �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.(Kurmaskie @NUM1).� This also makes the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about."	2	3		3																					
1700	3	"There are many features of the setting that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit,"" The time of year affected the cyclist because it�s mid June, @CAPS1 the region affected the cyclist because mid June in arizona is extremely hot and try. If it was in a more northern state in @DATE1 or I, ll it wouldn�t be as bad and you world not have the dance of a heat struggles. @CAPS1 when the terrain changed from flat to hills this affected him because it made it harder for him the to ride. These are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit."""	1	1		1																					
1702	3	In the essay, �Rough Road A head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First of all, he was traveling in the @CAPS1 which means it was very dry. This meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated. Also, the cyclist was biking in the heat. This meant that he was continuesly sweating which also depleted his water from his body and played tricks on his mind. Finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated. The hills also put a damper on his spirits, which made him have to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going. This part of the setting affected him emotionally. Overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him.	2	3		3																					
1705	3	The setting effected the performence of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist. The rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them. �over one long, crippiling hill, a building came into view.� The long, big hills that he had to go up and made him more thirsty, but probably more satisfied when it was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. This brought his hopes down. But continued to move on. In my life, I have never had such an experience to where I had to keep pushing and urging myself to my goal, but the closes I got, the more distractions got in the way to and stop me.	2	3		3																					
1706	3	�Do not exceed posted speed limit�, is a short story about a man who is bicycling through Yosemite and he asks some elderly men for direction and they lead him in this �old� shortcut that takes him through tough terrain and extreme famine. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways throughout the story for example when the bicyclist came to a deserted area he said �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. By this time he was malnourished & in need of water this extreme thrist also reselted in him passing an abandoned Welch�s grape juice factory with an advertisement with a young boy pouring a fresh glass of juice in his mouth. He says �In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building,�, then he goes into detail about the building, this mood & feeling by this time was tired and worn out and the advertisement didn�t help the situation at all. The authors mood did change with the setting and before it got better it was worse.	3	2		3																					
1711	3	"In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected they cyclists physical abilities. The features affected is abilities, because the climate and dangerous environment was hot and rough to handle. These features were hot and rough 'Since he was in the California deserts in June. The passage that supports this is,�. Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Also, the features of the setting give him determination. They give him determination, because each horizon he sees gives him hope. They give him hope since he knows he is that much @NUM1 to Yosemite National Park. The passage that supports this is when he drops,"".distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that @CAPS1 could move it that far, I�d be fine.� In the story,"" Rough road ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of his settings affect both they cyclists physical and mental abilities"	2	3		3																					
1713	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a few ways. The roads were nice and smooth then turned to hills. It was a hot day in June and he had a sparse water supply with him. He was peddling through the desert�s of California. The last thing that effected him was that there wasn�t very many places to stop for water.	1	1		1																					
1715	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. It seems to be the more despirate the situation the more determand her becomes. Pg @NUM1 (I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean). Right after he thinks this he climbed away for the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams. He says pg @NUM1 come troubles, thirst and tean where all behind me, this shows that after a situation the bilaver tells realeoved of all earthley obligations. Not only does the settings affect the cyclist but the entire story around him.	2	2		2																					
1716	3	The setting of the story, are very dry and humid, and flat, and hilly. The author noticed the terrain changing, �Flat road. Was replaced by short, rolling hills� (Joe kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a dessert like surronding during June, and nothing surronding him is a scary thought. The heat, and lack of water affect him, by him possibly getting mirages, or he @MONTH1 faint, because of the heat, and how much fluid he has lost. The hills don�t help any eigther.	2	1		2																					
1717	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is riding through the desert in the middle of June yet he has very little water. This affects him because he is thirsty but he doesn�t have a lot of water to drink and he is in a desert in the middle of June which makes it very hot. Also in the story it says he comes to Welch�s Grape Juice Factory were on the side of the building he see picture of a �young boy pouring a refreshing a loss of juice into his mouth� This make the cyclist even thirstier but he continues one to find water at a bait shop.	1	1		1																					
1720	3	The features of the setting very much affect the cyclist. He had to ride through tough conditions and became very exhausted. I believe the toughest feature of the setting was the heat. He told us, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.�  He was talking about how he needed to sip from his water more than normally. Another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down. As he was riding he said, �Flat road was replace by short, rolling hills.� I believe riding over these hills in the hot @DATE1 in a California desert was a very tough task for the cyclist. I believe the terrain very much affected him.	2	3		3																					
1721	3	The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the �� high   deserts of California� �   (kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills �   (Kurmaskie @NUM1   ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one   of them as a   �� long, crippling hill� � (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). Clearly, the terrain, which got   increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1722	3	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path. He had lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.�  	2	2		2																					
1723	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist like if you have to goup hill or along long bumpy type roads. Then in the essay it says �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit: @CAPS1 does make things more difficult than average. Especially with a lack of water to make things worse.	1	1		1																					
1724	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First of all, the cyclist says he�s in Lodi, California on a �gorgeous day in June.� It�s very hot in California in June, so the biker is affected by the weather because he could die of heatstroke. Also, he is in the middle of the desert , where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path a large snake that are possible poisonous in the way. That puts him in more despair, because he could get hurt by a wild animal, or run out of water with no place to go get more ! So the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1727	4	The author concludes the story with this because gardens cannot grow with snow on the ground. So she she figurers when all the snow is melted she�ll try to grow another one. I feel as if she wasn�t  happy enough to grow another garden I think she should be more interested in growin it then disappointed.    	0	0		0																					
1729	4	The author concludes the story with that passage to show the importance of the inspiration Saeng gets from the hibiscus plant. Saeng, throughout the story was comforted by the hibiscus plant because it reminded her of home. The plant during the winter metaphorically explains: @CAPS1 attitude towards her new country and her driving test; the hibiscus plant in the winter is not as beautiful in the bitter cold, but it adapts and survives, and returns to its beautiful state in the spring. Saeng is bitter about her new country and driving test, but is adapting, and will be inspired by the beautiful state of the hibiscus in the spring to try her test again. In conclusion, the author ended the story in that way to stress importance in the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus plant.	3	2		3																					
1731	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph of, �Winter Hibiscus�, because it takes us back to things that happened in the story. Saeng failed the test before. In the spring the hibiscus will be budding again. Saeng realized that many of the things she thought were strange, were almost familiar to her now. The calls of the snow geese were almost familiar to her. The snow melting will tell her that it is now spring. Some of the things that might happen as a result of spring coming might be that @PERSON1 will past the test. Her mother will be proud of her. Also, Saeng will start to become a customed to her new country and her new surrounding and stopremenising about her life back in Vietnam.	2	2		2																					
1732	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author wanted to tell about about when saeng will take the test again. The author told the time with the season of the spring. In spring all the snows were melted and the geese and hibiscus has budding. And this paragraped make the reader to understand easyer. This is why the author include this paragraph in the story. 	1	1		1																					
1733	4	"The story ended with the author saying, ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is upset about spending @NUM1 on a plant that she had felt was different than the plant at home. She is stating that she is not going to take the test of buying one again until the geese return and the Hibiscus budds."	0	0		0																					
1737	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story started out by Saeng failing the test, going out and buying a plant to comfort her and confessing to her mom. The plant related to her by the memories of her homeland and when she failed that test she felt very depressed and sad. She cried to show her pain, and bought a plant to cheer her up. As she told her mom she felt the pain again but, her mother made her favorite food and helped her plant the plant. She knew that it wasn�t like the old plant but, it was the thought and memories she knew that she couldn�t just give up, so when it came the right time she was going to try the test again. It relates because it helps the readers understand the story a little better and shows that she wasn�t going to just quit. Her mother was very understanding and when she goes to retake the test she will be prepared. That is how it relates back to the story.	2	2		2																					
1738	4	I think he concluded the story with paragraph cause then do thing in the story and the report it so when the geese left they will come back and leave again so that what I think I take the test again means.	0	0		0																					
1739	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when every thing starts coming back she will take the test. That is why the author concludes the story with this parigraph	1	1		1																					
1740	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show a sense of determination that Saeng posesses. When Saeng comes back and shows her mother the hibiscus plant, she is very upset, with tears in her eyes.Her mother at first is disappointed in her for buying the plant, but is then understanding when she realizes that Saeng was distraught. The mother offers to help Saeng plant the hibiscus, which comforts Saeng a little bit, helping her gain the determination she needs to recover. The story says �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This quote states that Saeng realizes that things at home can be the same as things in her new country. The author uses the term �familiar� to express that Saeng is starting to accept the fact that some things @MONTH1 be different, but she will eventually get used to it, making her view on life more positive.  	2	2		2																					
1741	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because in the paragraph there is a lot said that is the main part of this story. For example all the names and talks about the seasons and there comparisions and differences and it talks abouts different buddings like when you get your mids your nuggets and headies of the plant. Because hibiscus is a new form of some nice @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
1742	4	He states this as the conclusion because it shows the faith that she has in the flower and how it will bring her luck for her up coming test. She feels like the familiar flower is out of place as she is and they can relate to somethings.	1	1		1																					
1744	4	The arthur uses it because Saeng got confidence back from planting the hibiscus and everything that happened that year. So now shes ready and that�s what the arthur wanted the reader to figure out.	1	1		1																					
1747	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph by teaching Saeng how to be confident and vow silently, In order to teach her more lessons because of the fact she failed the test in the middle of the passage Saeng tells her mother that when the snow is gone in the spring time she will retake the test that she failed. Her mother was very upset when she found out that Saeng failed the test the first time.	1	1		1																					
1748	4	They probably ended it like that to build suspense of leave the reader on a good note because someone @MONTH1 think things are going to get better for them and Saeng @MONTH1 get her license. They @MONTH1 get more money.	1	1		1																					
1751	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all things have routins and things they have to do to survive. The geese fly @CAPS1 for the warm months so they don�t die from the cold. The flower dies in the winter is brought back to life in the spring. This pertains to Saeng because when the geese and the flowr come back she will take the test of trying to fit in, in her new country, That is why the auther chose this to end the story.	2	1		2																					
1754	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how everything is changing and adapting to the change. Saeng decides that with this change, she can also adapt to her new life by going back and passing the drivers test. The hibiscus also represents how something also from her homeland has come to america and must now survive. When it begins to bud, Saeng will begin to start adapting to america by passing her drivers test. It�s all about trying to become accustomed to changes. When Saeng feels bad for failing, that�s why something from her past is such a comfort to her.	2	2		2																					
1755	4	By ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and perservering . for example , when the author says� when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding ,�she show the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring by returning to their home and the hibiscus is starting fresh by  budding again. This is why spring is when saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test. The paragraph also shows that saeng, like the hibiscus, is perservering. The hibiscus is perservering by making it through the winter and blooming again while saeng   is perservering by retaking the test. The author ends with this paragraph to show that saeng is not going to give up. 	3	3		3																					
1761	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when saeng and her mother go back to there home where the flowers were more beautiful than the flowers where there living now. She wants to plant flowers that�s going to remind her of her home. In the story saeng mother said that it�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here this winter hibiscus her mother wanted her to know that the only thing that maths is that the plant can last threw winter.	1	1		1																					
1764	4	The reason the author of the story �Winter hibiscus� ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up. We need to preserve through every problem we go through in life. If we don�t and we just give up we will never get anything done in life. She vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. I hope I pass my driving test the first time just like I did the learner�s permit test. Also you can�t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up.	1	2		2																					
1768	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is most comfortable when she is surrounded by things from her homeland. She thinks she will be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again, and when the hibiscus begins to bud. Narrator says ��A saebya ledges tall and high, had surrounded their garden��� @CAPS2 is evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well reminds her of it. The narrator also says,�� Overhead, a flock of @CAPS1 geese, their faint looks clear and -yes-familiar to Saeng now,�� @CAPS2 proves that the geese symbolize @CAPS3 home also.     	2	2		2																					
1773	4	"The author had concluded this story with this paragraph to make it as if they were on a clean slate like they had started over. So the past no longer haunts them. Saeng sounds as if she has a bit of relief after she takes her mom the plate. I believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she sounds sure of herself. She sounds certain she sounds as if she want to start over because she says ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. To me she sounds like a brand new person. Who has forgotten about the past."	1	2		2																					
1775	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng�s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about.	3	2		3																					
1776	4	The author used the last paragraph because the hibiscus is a symbol for saeng. It shows that she will be ready when spring comes. When the plant is ready to bud, she will have faith about taking the test. She'll probably want to take care of the plant before she takes the test. When the plant bads, saeng won�t have to take care of it anymore.	1	1		1																					
1777	4	"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because Saeng is saying when the good time came back around she will try for the test again because She had failed it. for example on page @NUM1 at the top She "" I-I falled the test"" thats why i think the author concludes this with the Story because it was important to Saeng to past the test in the good time of season Spring. "	1	1		1																					
1779	4	I think that the included that because she is compareing her slef as a flower. When she grows again like a flower she will go prove to past that test. She�s saying there always a second chance. She want to tell everyone that it�s to miss or a misake. For an example �they said there were many of things that she had thought of strangely, season up seson.	2	1		2																					
1780	4	"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent.� @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant."	0	0		0																					
1785	4	For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior. She said ��when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again. So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     	1	2		2																					
1786	4	I believe that the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuation in life. In the story Saeng takes a �test� and fails. She goes out and buys a hibiscus plant for well over what she what she should have paid for it. Her test is to try to get over the memories of her real �home� that Saeng is now only cries about when she thinks of it. To Saeng the plant represents memories and a life that she once had, but no longer does, however does want it back. Her vowe to herself is that when the geese come flying back over her that she will go back to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home and try once again to say �home� without breaking down, and without having something extremely expensive.	2	2		2																					
1792	4	I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more. For example, she added �hibiscus is budding.� Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it.	1	1		1																					
1793	4	The author concludes the story with in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is  budding then I will take that test again, because she is saying there will be a new year. For example he failed it the first time she will wait until she tries again. Another example she just want to try until she get her driving license.	1	1		1																					
1797	4	Hope, a new beginning, adjustment-all are reasons why the speaker concludes by saying �when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� That hibiscus flower gives that girl hope because it remind her of her grandmother and back home, how wonderful things were back there, and by the flower blooming, she realize it could wear out there too. She�ll also have a new beging in the spring, by spring she should adjust to her surrounding and have new friends, things to do, and new memories to look back on, that looking backabout flawall won't be as bad the flower will bring her hope and comfort with her adjustment.	2	2		2																					
1801	4	"The author had concluded her paragraph like this for emotion. This last paragraph gives emotion to know she can�t garden do to winter. In the winter time all of her plants die for the season. 'The, author is just saying saeng is coming back. After the snow, frosts and cold weather is gone Saeng will come next season so she can continue with her gardening, plants and soil. As said �I will take the test again"" saeng.  Meaning saeng will come back and take the test of effort with her gardening and her mother next time/ next season when her starts to grow again."	1	1		1																					
1802	4	I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden. Without no friends just let in her mom	1	1		1																					
1805	4	The author ends the story the way she did to show how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are a like and how Saeng will overcome her obstacle when the plant overcomes its obstacle. Saeng�s obstacle is adjusting to her new life and the first step in that is passing her driver�s test. The reader knows she has to pass because Saeng tells her mother , �I-I failed the @NUM1]. The hibiscus must make it through the winter, it also has to adjust to new surrounding to survive, just like Saeng. The mother says to Saeng,�� but its strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus.Thats what matter �[@NUM2]. So,if the winter hibiscus� job, or hurdle that it has to jump,it to make it, to stay alive during the winter months, then its job will be done in the spring. The author ends the story with Saeng telling herself, �� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�[@NUM2]. If Saeng�s obstacle is completing, and passing the driver�s test, and she passes in the spring, right as the hibiscus passes it�s �test� , the symbolism between the two, showing a determined spirits to adopt, will grow deeper because that will adopt and pass their obstacle at the same time.	3	3		3																					
1806	4	I think that the story came back to this because that is what the story starts off with. It all started with Saeng going to take a test but she did not pass it. So when the weather is better she would have a batter time trying to pass that test. This is way I think she came back that the test.	1	1		1																					
1808	4	"The author ends the story with that paragraph, to give an unsight on the next story. I think there will be another story because there are clue to support my theory. Just at the beginning of the paragraph at just when they come back. Then at the end at stay ""then I will take the test again. I dint stay happily ever after at anything similar its that at just stated those personally changes mentioned. So I think what the author will write another story so we could see if Saeng will pass her test.   "	1	1		1																					
1810	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because these geese coming back symbolize Saeng�s determination and hope that she needs to pass the driving test. She will wait for the winter to pass so that she can pass the test. The coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth. Saeng will have the chance again to pass the driving test with renewed faith and encouragement. This is a great way to end the story because it is really deep and makes the reader think about the meaning of the scene and how the geese, hibiscus plant, and spring arriving effect the conclusion of the story.	3	2		3																					
1812	4	"The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is a about a girl who moved with her mother to @LOCATION1. The story tells about the girls transition into the different culture. During the story, the author makes references to the daughter having to pass a test. At the end of the story the author wrote �In the spring�then I will take that test again.� In the text, the girl says �it�s-it�s not a real one,� when referring to the winter hibiscus plant she bought. The reader could infer that this quote means that the girl has memories of home, but they are not the real thing. Also the author wrote �� much preferred it to the Big Mac"". This quote shows that she misses her own culture & cannot adapt to the @CAPS1 one that she lives in now. In conclusion, the girls test @MONTH1 be that she needs to be able to handle change & also be able to recall memories of her homeland with happiness instead of sadness."	2	3		3																					
1813	4	The author concludes the story with that ending because he wanted to show the reader �if you just try, you might like it,� and that�s why the girl said she would come back next spring when the snows melt so she can take the test again.	0	0		0																					
1815	4	The author  concludes  the  story  with  that  paragraph because its telling / showing  us  that  Saeng  is  going   to  try to pass  the  test  in the spring  .

1816	4	The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because he figures after all that has happened like she failed the test he wanted to end to be remembered is a happy thing. Also wanted the end to show how something bad happened but  next she was going to do it again. The author wanted to show that she wouldn�t give up, she goes after what she wants. And he wanted that to be the last pharagraph.	1	1		1																					
1817	4	The author concludes the story the way that they did to signify that the girl will not give up trying to pass her test and will adapt to her new found home and make it what her home in Vietnam was to her.

1818	4	"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says �when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption.

1823	4	In this short story, Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring because she knows that she will be able to pass it once she has accepted living in this new place. After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family, and lifestyle. This prevented her from focusing on the test. However, once she realized that the flowers are beatiful in her new home too, she began to accept the changes. The geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didn�t want her mother to be disappointed in her again. After seeing her mother's disappointment and loving kindness, Saeng was determined to pass the test. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be ready because she has adjusted to and accepted her new life.	3	2		3

1826	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with the paragraph for a few reasons. One reason is that she is trying to overcome change and wants to make the situation better. She trys doing that by taking the test again. The author also concludes with the paragraph because she feels heartbroken that life is not going her way and that she needs to do something about it. Thats why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show you if she is determined or not. If she will stick through it or not.	2	2		2																					
1829	4	 The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story  ��Winter Hibiscus�� with that paragraph to show Saeng  starting over��� In the spring , When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding� connects to her  life, is that she is starting fresh in away. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, she is making on effort, and ��take that test again��� By retailing the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to ��@CAPS1 of loss.�� and to her grief.      	2	2		2																					
1832	4	The author's conclusion to the story shows how Saeng interpreted the experience of that day. She uses a spring time setting to show when her confidence in herself is reborn. Seeing her hibiscus bud in the spring will giver herself and newfound integrity to go try that driving test again.	1	2		2																					
1835	4	I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test. For example when she said, �When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
1836	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the main character Saeng and her mother, moved from their homeland to this new place, where everything was different. she was having a very hard time adapting to this new place, and Saeng failed an importian test. She had been very discouraged by this, and she was trying to remind herself of being at home. She bought the winter Hibiscus to remind her of home, but when she was planting it she became very determined to try and adapt, by taking the test, when the hibiscus would bud. The author is concluding by there being hope, and determination for Saeng to adapt to her new home.	2	2		2																					
1840	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause. Saeng didn�t think the winter hibiscus was In the ground now and that when she got back all of her plants was gone do to the snow so she said she will take that test again meaning she will start back to the first steps of her plants and flowers.	0	0		0																					
1842	4	The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it�s related to she thinks, when her semile of welcome warmed Saeng �cheep skip over live to you�re back she saw cheerfully� @CAPS1 it�s past time what took you so long? now did it go? Did you? She feels very skip over its related to	0	0		0																					
1845	4	The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know. The ending also tells the reader that persistance is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow melting, the geese returning and the flower blooming which are things that happen constantly and almost stop because they refuse to give up and die. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance. The author also chose to end with this paragraph since it has several analogies to persistance which is vital in life.   	3	3		3																					
1846	4	The authoR concludes the stoRy with this paRagRaph because he is saying that Saeng likes to do thing in the spring when she sees flowers gRowing because she feels like she is at home, so she feel moRe confident. about passing the test.	1	1		1																					
1848	4	The auther ends with that paragraph to show how Saeng, like the budding  Hibiscus, will get a new start in the spring and overcome obstacles.	1	1		1																					
1849	4	The auther concludes the story with, �when they cam back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and tis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think the auther used that conclusion to make the reader want to finish the story on their own. Or he could write another story to finish it. Most authors conclude their storys like this so the reader is in control about the ending.	1	1		1																					
1850	4	Based on my understanding of the story I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to emphize what will happened as well as to gate back to get to readler to thinking and build te excitement and with question as well as though in the head after reading the pessage. to my self to capture the reader attention as to the following upto and wondering of she survive and was able to adapt to the lifestyle that she was not use to and also see test her ability to see if she will be able to survive the different types of season and to know that no matter what you face in life their is alway more obstacles a head of you.	2	1		2																					
1855	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending but I have no idea on what that means so the author should explain what it means not me.	0	0		0																					
1857	4	The author concludes this paragraph because Saeng is going to wait untill winter is over so she can have a fresh beginning. She wants to try again because the last time she messed up and tilled the plants. Saeng wants to become a gardener like her mother.	0	0		0																					
1858	4	The author of this essay includes those sentences as the conclusion to make it that she will realize that they are coming back.	0	0		0																					
1860	4	Confidence, persistance, memories � all things that Saeng has �that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy, she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and @CAPS1 from Vietnam; @CAPS1 she sees reminds her of it, that last paragraph, where it says, �then I will take that test again,� shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she won�t give up, Saeng misses almost @CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. She also misses her family and how they look and dress. Her memories were probably hold her back from concentrating hard on her drivers test, she knows she wanted to do good so she bought the flower in hopes that would make her feel better. Hopefully, Saeng�s life will get better in the United states and she will learn to love this country.	1	2		2																					
1862	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he�s trying to prove his point. I think that Saeng was comparing herself to the flower. For example the flower was originally a wild flower and then and then it was planted in a pot. Saeng was free happy girl but then she had to move to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng feel like they are out of place. Since in the story Saeng is similar to the flower then at the end then at the end of the story I think that Saeng thinks that if the flower can survive the winter then she can survive @LOCATION1 and she can pass the test. This is why I think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across.	3	2		3																					
1863	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he or she wants to show Saeng is determined to not fail that drivers test. The author wants to leave Saeng on a good note so she wont be sad. When she takes the test again shell be better prepared and know what shes expecting. Shell have a better winter.	1	1		1																					
1868	4	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) @CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and won�t give up. �Saeng  vowed silently to herself, �I will take that test again�, Finally I think  the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how  they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, @CAPS2, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again.	2	3		3																					
1870	4	I think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature. She is saying that she was not ready for all the challenges she was going to face, For example she did not pass her test but instead of crying about it she just said I will take it again next year. In the story she also longed for her homeland, which she truley missed. She coped with this by buying a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her grandmother overall the main character showed depth and maturity throughout the piece.	3	2		3																					
1871	4	The author concludes the story the way that she does because it shows Saeng�s willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming winter. Saeng vows to herself, �When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�� @CAPS1 from this, you can tell that Saeng has hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her home. She says of the hibiscus, �it�s not like the kind we had before.� But she realized that the hibiscus could be a reminder of home as well as reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive living somewhere new.  	2	2		2																					
1872	4	The author concludes this story with the promise Saeng made to herself to take the test again, come springtime, because Saeng is having trouble adapting to her new home, and she won�t give up on fitting in after only one failure. Remembering her home and that she will never be able to return are painful thoughts to Saeng and memories of it help her cope with her loss. The hibiscus and other familiar flowers she found comforted her, because they reminded her of home. At springtime when the geese return and the hibiscus starts blooming, Saeng will feel ready again to take the test, the spring represents the chance for another try, and a new beginning.	2	2		2																					
1873	4	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph. The author chose because the sentence informs you Saeng will take the test agin. In paragraph @NUM1 Saeng tell�s her mother she faild the test. So by the time spring comes around the hibiscus will start budding and Saeng will retake the test. Also the geese left the home temporally because of snow. So she sort of compares herself to the geese because she missis her home. The geese will return when the time is right, that is what the author concludes in the story�s paragraph.	2	1		2																					
1879	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can not wait until spring because her plant will budd and it will remind her of her home land again. She can not wait to take the test in spring because she would have been alsole to stayed and she @MONTH1 pass the test in the spring because she did not pass it the first time she toke the test. Maybe she concluded the story with this paragraph because she @MONTH1 like the spring and she can not wait for it to come.    	1	1		1																					
1883	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng�s determination to adapt to the change in her life. In the story saeng fails her drivers test and is struggling to adapt to her new life in @LOCATION1. However, when she sees that the hibiscus and geese are familiar, she is determined to adopt as well. Saeng buys a hibiscus because it reminds her of home. This not only comforts her it also makes her miss her old home more. The hibiscus can survive in both @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1, so it helps saeng realize that she can as well. The author includes the geese because they help saeng realize that she is becaming more familiar with things in the United states, so she can continue to adapt. Saeng says that she now recognizes the �V� shape of the geese. Realizing that she is becoming more accostomed to @LOCATION1 and she is able to survive helps her reach the determination to retake and pass her driving test. The author includes it to summarize the story theme of adopting to change.	3	3		3																					
1884	4	I think that the author put that sentence to get a little personal with the character so you can relate to that person.	0	0		0																					
1886	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author Minfong Ho concludes the story with that paragraph because it was a way of saying shes going to forget about what happen in the past with her failing her test and shes going to do better the next time. Its like the author is saying she will be reborn again like the hibiscus, when the spring comes. Through the story Saeng had to adjust just like the hibiscus. And the hibiscus inspired Saeng to do well where shes at. So it�s a new beginning to Saeng, after all her learning from hibiscus."	2	2		2																					
1889	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 she is detarmand to pass that test and is not going to give up until she passes it.	1	1		1																					
1890	4	The reason why I feel the authour ended the story with this paragraph is because she is showing how the charater has matured and how the charater grew in her circumstance. This shows that because you failed once doesn�t mean your going to fail again. Also it�s okay to feel out of place there is alway going to be a time in life where a new beginning is going to start so it is your choice to take that chance or be stuck in your own ways but the decision is always up to you.	2	1		2																					
1891	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by �Minfong Ho� she ends the story by saying, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. �I-I failed the test�. As many kids do, Saeng failed her driving test and she is crucially upset about it. nobody wants to fail at something and it is almost a humiliating experience to have failed at a test. knowing that others have already successfully passed. With the quote in the introduction paragraph, or the one in the question, it was written as a sign of symbolism. When the geese return back north, it is to show that they are ready to �start over� again or to �try again�. When the hibiscus is budding it is trying to �start life� again. Saeng seeing objects doing things over and over again empowers her to want to succeed and try again. She realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail. Minfong concludes with that quote because she understands that no matter what the obstacle, you must press forward and keep trying in order to succeed. She realizes success can only come from hard work and commitment, and that that is what makes a great, strong individual.	2	3		3																					
1892	4	The reason why the author concludes the paragraph with that sentence is because her wants to let reader know that it's not over. He wants the reader to know @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget. And also that all this will happen again.	1	1		1																					
1893	4	The author concludes the ending as �I will take that test again� meaning that the things she going through now is going to happen again but next time she will be peperd. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the place the mother suports her as she go throught winter the hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represent more than it selfs, in this text of winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho shows this biscus that she bougth when she was in wrost time, she went throug winter with the hibiscus nand at the last paragraph of the story express �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding� she is thinking of the feature and how she �saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring. She can�t wait until winter is over and is just waiting for the spring to come.	2	2		2																					
1894	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants. When she gets  gets  back she wants the snow to melt and everything. That is what the author is telling me from the story.	0	0		0																					
1895	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to ensure the reader that she will say again. Also, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life it will always be something and or someone their to assure you of everything. The author also wanted the reader to feel a sence of similarity to the character meaning no matter how out of place you feel its always something you can relate to	1	1		1																					
1896	4	The author concludes the story with thise paragraph so that we buy his comming book, or so that we get more exited.	1	1		1																					
1897	4	"In this story theauther deicides to end the story with this paragraphe, ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buding, then I willtake that test agien."" because she wants to take the test when every thing is isanters, de forexample she wants everything she likes in her nuforment such as the flowers, the geese and the whether. Another reason why I say the author ends the story with that paragragh because she wants to be, ua eviorment like the one that she was in her home country forexemple there was no snow it was like sping time all ver around. This is why I say that the auther ended the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1898	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, that cannot pass the test until it is. �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of before had become through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. �This shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants because she is thinking back to other times where things have been strange during the winter and better in the spring and @DATE2 seasons when the plants are budding, so she believes that she will actually pass the drivers test when she feel comfortable, when the plants have budded.	2	2		2																					
1902	4	The author concludes this story in the paragraph to show that saeng wont stop, just because she faild one first time. It also shows that she is not going to let certaint things keep her down.	1	1		1																					
1904	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� made a good choice to conclude the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.� This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become �almost familiar to her now� The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng�s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her �obstacle,� and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng�s life will have come full circle.	3	3		3																					
1905	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its important when she says when geese returns and this hibisus is budding then she says she will take that test again and to tell the reader when she will take that test again. Thats way its in the story.	0	0		0																					
1906	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it emphasiseS that Saeng is willing to retake the test when it comes back. I also think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story the @NUM1 to last paragraph says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repititon of the season upon season, almost farmiliar to her now.� This sentence shows me that @PERSON1 is slowly getting used to the new place. Also how she is changing her mind about the pLant and the fact that even though its not the same, it can still have meaning. Therefore, I think the author made a good choice in ending the story with this paragraph.   	2	2		2																					
1907	4	The last paragraph states �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.� I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to state the fact when her new home is like her old home maybe she will feel more confident and more in her place, instead of cold winter total opposite of where she use to live. The feeling of her old home, in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then she will take the test feeling at home and pass.	1	2		2																					
1910	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think he�s trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season  that was almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again	1	1		1																					
1915	4	The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with that paragraph because it sums up everything the hibiscus has given Saeng for strength and courage. Just like the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in this new country and the hibiscus helps her realize the importance in adapting to her survival in order to live happily. She can�t alway be dwelling in the past but learn to like where she lives now. Therefore, when the author writes, �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� it is a direct symbol of Saeng budding or opening her mind to the @CAPS1 ways, like learning to drive. 	2	2		2																					
1916	4	I believe the author of �winter Hibiscus� used this for the last paragraph because it is saying when she sees that hibiscus it will give her memories of home again which will bring encouragement for the test. �The geese symbolize Saeng's determination to pass the test and try like the new country. Saeng explains, �she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the @NUM1) this quote creates a vivid image in my mind that lets me know Saeng will really go and take that test when she has encouragement from not only the geese but the hibiscus also.	3	3		3																					
1917	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because it is in a way letting you know that everything�s going to be alright. Saeng is going to retry her drivers test again and everything is back to the way she likes best.It gives you a sense of hope, that everything is going to be alright wi her. Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe it�s saying to that is why I think the author concludes wi that paragraph.	1	2		2																					
1918	4	The Author uses this paragraph to @CAPS1 the Story because it shows how Saeng wants to adapt to this country and she is allready beging to understand it and like it. When it @CAPS2 �and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� It is a metaphor about herself when the @CAPS3 begins to bloom and @CAPS4 Just as she is starting to bloom and @CAPS4. This is why the Author endeded with this passage.	1	1		1																					
1921	4	The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.	1	2		2																					
1926	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus the author minfong to ends the story as she does for many reasons.	0	0		0																					
1928	4	"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again�. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."	1	1		1																					
1930	4	She vowed this because just as the geese would return she shall. also as the test themselves to learn and grow she would. Furthermore she @CAPS1 the the test of love, survial and family tridition she would know that comeing. back was destiny. In example they come to raise their young for the journey that they shall face and Help them to  realise that they always will come back because their lives started there and to always exacpe cold and man kind that wants to harm their lives. The winter months are very harsh there so They know that they have to leave just to @CAPS2. She learns the lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival.	1	1		1																					
1931	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he made a comittment to himself of taking the test all over again. He probably said that because there�s always a next time for everything. mostly the reason he said it was to remind himself that theres always another try of everything. Finally that most people such know that everyone get a second chance.	1	1		1																					
1932	4	The author concludes the story like this because the seasons are changing and there finising there cycle and starting a new one. Thus I think this is a good way to end a story like this because I kinda sets a mood and a feel at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
1934	4	To set a tone and to talk about how they look. Also that little paragraph can also start another book or to get you into studing things. It could also compare Your life with the geeses life. Like explaning what hardships you went through.	1	1		1																					
1938	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it lets the reader know that there is still a chance for Saeng; she is not giving up on herself or the test. While reading you will find that Saeng is comforted by memories of her homeland, and obviously this move to another country was hard on her. In the story the author writes, �It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she had known it would feel.� The feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower comforted her. She then proceeded to purchase the plant, because she failed the test she needed something to lift her spirits back up once again. The author decided to end the story with Saeng stating that once �this hibiscus plant is budding,then l will take that test again� because as the reader should have learned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the only positive aspect in her life since the move. It is giving her motivation to once again take the driver�s test, and it is also letting the reader know that Saeng is not giving up.	3	2		3																					
1943	4	Saeng wants to take the test again when it is beautiful out and the hibiscus is buddy. The plant shows the beautiful achievement of passing the test. The plant will help her past the test by being strong, tough, and nicely finished. These characteristics reprecent the girl and the flower. The day was a good day and wants to take the test on the same day. The plant was strong and tought. This represents the girl in that time she didn�t pass. She told her mother and was very understandig about it. The plant represents beautiful things and the geese represent beautiful things. The girl wants to do that on that time of day and thinks she will get it next time. When she completes and past her test she wants to come home to the beautiful surroundings to remember that day. The author concluded with that statement to represent the importance of the plant and the surroundings of when she wants to past the test.	1	2		2																					
1944	4	"The author might have concluded the story with that paragraph, because she wanted to remind the reader how sincearl, ""Saeng"" was to the hibiscus flower. I say this because through out the story @PERSON1 was very compassionate about the flower. I think she felt as through she could relate to the flower."	1	1		1																					
1945	4	The author ends with this paragraph because it symbolizes a new beggining, Saeng says, �I � I failed the test.� She is also really sad, she is making a commitment to get a fresh start on life, just like how the world does every spring. The theme of the story is when life seems hard take a new approach. She intends to retake the drivers test.	1	2		2																					
1946	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng will be ready to take the test in time. She first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings. Just like the hibiscus flower and the geese. The hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store The geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter. Saeng needs to still learn more and adapt before she can pass her drivers test. By ending the story with this paragraph it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do. She needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country.	2	2		2																					
1947	4	"Minfong Ho ended her story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with an optomistic sentence. She concluded it this way because the main character of the story was beginning to lose hope. Saeng decided to retake the driving test when her hibiscus flower was blooming. This flower reminds her of her past life in Vietnam with her grandmother. ""Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb"". She preferred her life in Vietnam than hers in @LOCATION2. She was goint to wait until ""this hibiscus is budding,"" so she can feel more comfortable and happy. The author wanted to end it so Saeng would be happy. "	2	2		2																					
1949	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to develop the theme and to project what the main character will do after she plants the hibiscus, I believe that the theme of this story is adjusting to changes in life and the author builds upon this theme in the final paragraph. In the ending paragraph, the author writes, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author demonstrates how Saeng learns to adjust when things change in her life. In this instance, Saeng fails her driver�s test and to deal with this setback, she buys a hibiscus to remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new start test once the geese ??? (THIS @CAPS1 IS @CAPS2)	2	2		2																					
1951	4	Saeng did not give up on herself. She said she would take it over again then she might pass it. You will not always pass on your first try it takes a while sometime. Saeng encourage you to never to give up just cause you did not get it on your first time. She also builds confidence in herself. That�s why the author concluded the story that way.	1	1		1																					
1953	4	"The author concludes the story with the last paragraph because Saeng failed the test at the beginning of the story. After going through the plants and learned new things, it is natural for Saeng to take the test again in the spring(end of the story).  I think this because Saeng  learned that she has  to get used to hung in @LOCATION1 and the plant remainded her  that she has to when  she saw the geese fly in the ""V""formation,it was the same as back at home in Vietnam. She realized that it was the same as Vietnam and she has to take that driver's test again in order to get used to living in @LOCATION1 with all of its changes. I also think that its prayer to end the story with her taking the driver's test in spring because the geese will come back,and the hibiscus is budding. This is the beginning for them as well as Saeng.                                                                                                       "	2	2		2																					
1955	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� the author concludes the story the way he does to show that Saeng isn�t giving up. In the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick. �Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work.� This quote shows that when she sees familiar plants she is reminded of home, so in the spring when her plant blooms she will see it and feel more comforting and more at home which will help her find the strength to pass the driving test. So as the plant blooms, so does her comfort level.	2	1		2																					
1957	4	He concluded the story with that sentence because it told that she learned a lesson in life. all the way back home where she originally came from she missed her friends ibet and seeing her mother work out in the garden durring this time of year when its cold. I guess there poor in one way. In conclusion the choose this sentence because it sounds like she learned a lesson in life and even starting all over again but with a better understanding in her learning.	1	1		1																					
1958	4	Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her so she is going to take the test again after winter.	1	1		1																					
1960	4	  In the article the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to herself that �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is bidding, then I will take that test again� because the spring and the hibiscus reminds her of home. For example in the article she gets shaky because she cant say home because she misses it too much. So she finds things that reminds her of it like a plant called dok faeng-noi. It�s not the real plant but she gets it to remind her where she comes from. In conclusion, Saeng finds a plant, she likes the soring because it reminds her home. How about what reminds you of home. Think about it.	2	2		2																					
1965	4	In the short story �Winter hibiscus� The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author felt as thought Saeng would be ready to take thee test at that particular time.	1	1		1																					
1967	4	"In the last paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by minfong Ho The author concludes by saying  ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". I think the author concludes with this quote because it shows her determination to overcome this obstacle, For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort and the ability to over come. Saeng is very strong and she believes off of that determination which comes from her past. The author concluded with that because it shows Saeng�s determination."	2	1		2																					
1972	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because wants her to be successful and do good.	0	0		0																					
1973	4	In the response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because this story was about a plant growing back every year around the same time. The paragraph ment like I think when the plant came back inspring & the geese would come back around it be another test of growing and not letting the plant die	0	0		0																					
1975	4	Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past.	2	2		2																					
1976	4	The author concludes the paragraph with a statement that Saeng said. It was a very good statement. The author ended with this to show that she is motivated and determined to do this. She shows she is motivated in many ways. she says, �Here let me help you mother.� This shows that she is motivated by helping her mother finish what she started. She is also determined by saying, �almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through a quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familier now.� This shows that she wants to do something and she doesn�t think it is weird anymore. That is why the author concludes that statement.	1	2		2																					
1977	4	The Author concludes the story with this When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building then I will take that test again! because he or she are the ones who wrote the story. One information is her family moved to the united @ORGANIZATION1 from Vietnam. Second one is the Author could of made this story it was about her. Saeng fails her driving test.    	1	1		1																					
1979	4	The author shows a willingness to try harder in this story. She states that, �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author realizes that she is going to have to adapt. Also, saying that she will wait till the spring, means she is going to try again, and not give up. The author has a sentimental value to. Insince she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud, I believe she is referring that hibiscus to her country. Insince she has left her country, the hibiscus is the closet thing she has to it, and therefore, she will wait with the flower	2	2		2																					
1980	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng now thinks about images associated with memories in her new home, as well as images she remembers from Vietnam. At the beginning of the story, in the floral shop, she remembers her grandmother, as well as a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other things that remind her of certain feelings and experiences. At the end of the story, she uses both the hibiscus, which reminds her of her previous home, and the canadian geese, which don't seem so unfamiliar to her anymore, to represent passing of time. She now sees her new home as having familiar things in it attached to memories, as her old love did.	2	2		2																					
1981	4	The aurthor concludes the story with this paragraph. In same ways. One reason why the aurthor concluded the story with this paragraph is because in the story she sad something she really wanted. So she took it home and showed her mom, Then her mom look at her weird, because in the story it said that �you what? Her mother stared at her increously.� So then she explains that she failed the drivers test, but she didn�t give up. So at the end of the story she said that she will take that test again. So in conclusion that is why the aurthor concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	2		2																					
1985	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver�s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, ""in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .When the hibiscus is makeing a new start by budding in the spring Saeng will do the same ,by retaking her drivers test.With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about �What happened with the driver�s test ,what was the point of that ?�."	2	2		2																					
1991	4	"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."	1	1		1																					
1994	4	The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty.	1	1		1																					
1995	4	"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don�t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."	2	3		3																					
1996	4	The last paragraph of the �Winter Hibiscus� reads �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author ends with this statement to let the reader know that Saeng has hope and will continue to adjust to her new settling in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 the story, Saeng realizes that she is not as distant from her home in Vietnam as she believes. In the florists shops she sees �plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood worth. �The plants she grew up with exist in the @LOCATION2 as well. She fails �the test� by buying a winter hibiscus after breaking down crying, homesick. By the end of the story she recognizes that she is becoming more accustomed to her new life, which is �almost familiar to her now,� such as the geese flying overhead. The statement of the last paragraph means that by the spring, she hopes to no longer be homesick, and to think of the @LOCATION2 with its geese and winter hibiscuses as her home.	2	2		2																					
1997	4	The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. �the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is �strong enough to make it through the cold months that�s what matters.� This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming �familiar�. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it�s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   	3	3		3																					
1998	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new begining is starting  For example the fact that they moved to a different country. Thats what the author means when the spring comes. Spring represents a new life which is what Saeng & her mother are doing. Also the snow represents a blanked of the past / hard times. Last but not least when the hibiscus starts to bud that also means a new beganing. So if you put it all together you get the hard times going away when the snow melts & then a new beginning when spring starts & the flower buds  That is why the author put this paragraph in the story because they needed a fresh start.	2	2		2																					
1999	4	They author had conclued that sentence to be the coucluding sentence because saeng thinks she deserve another chance at taking the garden test because she has failed the test before  then having her mother to be disappointed in her. And to what Saeng say at the end of the story is that she's gonna have more confidence in doing the garden test again.	1	1		1																					
2002	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1.	1	1		1																					
2004	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 the carter Saeng want to finish or @CAPS2 Take the Test agin when they come back and and also the author is @CAPS3 people @CAPS4't give up what you are doing with your self then she say that ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding Then I will take that test agin"" she means that she will not give up at all."	1	1		1																					
2005	4	The author ended the story with that sentence because in the spring Saeng is going retake the test and her hibiscus will finally be budding. Saeng is going to retake the test because she failed it the @CAPS1 time she took. That is why the author put that sentence at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2007	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has vowed to retake the test in the spring and will have more confidence when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding. �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eye now swept over her. � Saeng feels lonely because she is from a different country and misses everything she knew and loved. Now she has the hibiscus to remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
2009	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of �Winter Hibiscus� means and this is why the author concluded it this way.	1	1		1																					
2010	4	"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: �I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."	2	2		2																					
2011	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because he was trying to tell us that hibiscus represents a comfort in a time of disappointment for Saeng. She saw the plant when she just fell her driving test. 	1	1		1																					
2012	4	Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author uses the conclusion �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says �and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went� It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn�t pass her test she doesn�t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  	2	2		2																					
2013	4	Why the author concludes it because the author wants to show her that she won�t give up. that she will take the test again and try harder next time to overcome her challenge, and not give up. The author wants to show her, that she�s not a quitter, and she�s filled with determination even though she has conflicts.	1	1		1																					
2017	4	The author uses this paragraph because it brings back memories from when Saeng put down the soil during the �winter hibiscus� and a flock of Canada geese flew by her. When Saeng failed her test the first time she did not dare look at her mother. She depended on the hibiscus which helped or want to retake the test but not until they re-bud again.	1	1		1																					
2019	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won�t give up if they don�t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life.	2	1		2																					
2020	4	 I think the author concludes the story the way hedid is becuse it will make people wownt to read the next story to see if the test is past it add suspenes to the story	1	1		1																					
2021	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because that represents saeng�s decision to try again and to overcome obstacles in her way. It is used instead of her saying � I will try again next spring � to show diction and to show her goal or decision in a different way for example, It says �, Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now.� At first, geese flying in the sky was new to her, but now she�s use to it. Maybe the author is making a reference to the geese since it will be familiar (the driving test) and she will pass like she got use to and familiar with geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, she�s been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph is saying simply that she�ll take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtones the point in the story, which is to not give up and the will to survive.	3	3		3

2025	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the symbolism of this paragraph tells that when every thing returns to normol and the �geese return and this hibiscus is budding that I will take that test again.� meaning she will be willing to move again and try to adapt.	1	1		1																					
2027	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by @PERSON1, a teenage girl; Saeng, and her family, have moved to united states from Vietnam. Saeng is walking home after failing her driver's test, and she passes a familiar plant. She then goes into a florist shop to purchase the plant. She arrives home and tells her mother she failed the test of course her mother is upset, but she makes dinner and the plant the �winter hibiscus� at the end of the story Saeng thinks to herself, �when they come back, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� I think Saeng says she will retake the test in spring because she feels confident and happy now that she is comfortable with the plant she has, and her mother isn't too mad at her. She feels that everything is going to be ok and she can retake the test in spring, when life is blooming.	3	2		3																					
2030	4	"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. �In the story it says, �When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub� This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:� �when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.  "	3	3		3																					
2032	4	I think the author concludes the Story with that statement becauses, the snow doesn�t melt in the spring geese don�t return in the winter and the hibiscus is not budding til spring either. The hibiscus is a beautiful plants Saeng loved this plant.    	0	0		0																					
2038	4	The author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because she wants to show the courage the girl has in immigrating to @LOCATION1. After having failed her drivers test Saeng was feeling deafeted and worthless. Her mother took into concideration and didn�t get mad at her for buying the flower. In fact she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that everything would work out in the end. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this she became overwhelmed with determination and took over planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis. Saeng�s mother was out in the cold planting and trying to make the best of her situation. By setting this example Saeng realized that she too could make the best out of her situation. This is why in the end Saeng decides to take her drivers test again, and ultimatly live with the same attitude her mother has.    	3	2		3																					
2041	4	Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to show the change in saeng�s heart and attitude toward her new life in @LOCATION1 spring symbolize rebirth, the author doesn�t include this on accident. Spring will be saeng�s time of rebirth where she can take the test and restart her new life in @LOCATION1.�When the snow melts�is included because winter symbolizes death and when the snows melt a way so will saeng fears. 	2	2		2																					
2043	4	The author chose to conclude the last paragraph with the story to show that she has not given up. It shows that she has not given up because it says �overhead...geese...honk...familiar to Saeng now (second to last paragraph).� @CAPS1 when she buys the hibiscus, because, it holds many memories from home, to keep her going. Her mother still making an �omelet with slices of bitter melon� made her math water, @CAPS1 reminding her of home, gave her hope to not give up.	1	1		1																					
2044	4	Saeng love Flowers and plants. The Author concludes this paragraph in the stony because it go Along with the story. In the spring when the snow melts.Saeng waS waiting For winter to beover so she can see he plants and Flowers again. Saeng like the values of plants and enjoy planting them. The Author include that paragraph because he or she was showing how Saeng is so in love with plants. She couldn�t wait a new winter break was over.	0	0		0																					
2046	4	because she is confused and is not yet youst to the country she is in how so she can concentrat on her test as soon as the flower will plown because she feels more like home she thinks that she will do better on the test	1	1		1																					
2047	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus makes her comfort, she says �when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. Since the author failed the test as it is told in the story, she will feel comfort taking the test again when the hibiscus come again after the snow season.   	1	1		1																					
2049	4	She thinks she is gonna pass the test because on spring becaus everything gets back on live againg flowers start growing again trees start to get green every thing starts to get Green the Geese are returning animals are starting to come out people go to the beach to distract their selve and that might be what she wan�t�s to do.	1	1		1																					
2052	4	I think the author includes this paragraph  in  the  story  because  it  makes  sence  the  geese  come  back  home  after  the  snow  melts  and  saeng  try�s  to  take  her  test  again  around  that  time.	1	1		1																					
2053	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, author ends the story with �When they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show that Saeng is ready to adapt, but still needs time. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with overcoming moving from her home, to an unfamiliar place hundreds of miles away. However, Saeng still isn�t ready to let go of her home yet. So she tries to hang on to her old memories, only to that in @LOCATION1, everything is different. When she buys a familiar plant to her, she realizes that even it is different in @LOCATION1, and gets angry that nit isn�t what she expected. However, at the end of the story she realizes that different isn�t always so bad, and vows to try to accept this new culture, but nows that it will still take a long time before she is ready to fully do so.	3	2		3																					
2055	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because that is when she will take the test again. Also because the geese made her realize, that many of the things that she had thought were strange before had become familiar. Just like the geese. It was through the quiet repitition of season upon season.	1	1		1																					
2056	4	She ends with that paragraph because it starts over. When the geese came back and the hibiscus is budding its like restart and she can try again, dealing with her memories of home and her adaption to the new country. I think she will be able deal with it better and take it again, it shows that she wont give up.	1	2		2																					
2059	4	"The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the show melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because Saeng failed the test before and now she wants to pass the test. She learned a lot from her mother that day that completely changed her attitude towards life."	1	1		1																					
2061	4	The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story �Winter Hibiscus� on with the last paragraph  was due to in the story the girl went out on a test. And on this test which I do not know what the test is, she failed it and returns with a saebba hedge. This is a tamed plant for the family. The family loves this plant. They are what I understand from the story, newcomers to a country. And the country is @LOCATION1. They�ve moved here from Vietnam. She goes for her driving test and comes home failed. One of the things her mother asks, �why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could a had the famed bee-maags� which is the mother�s attempt to say a Big Mac which is their favorite fast food sandwich. But the reason why the daughter comes back with the plant is she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. �Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again.� She believes the next time she goes, she will pass the test and that she will not be ashamed of it and that she will make her parents proud by passing the test due to it is a high honor to the family, I believe, from what I am getting from this. In Vietnam not many people drive and that they want their daughter to earn this and it is something they do not have.	2	2		2																					
2062	4	It is clear that Saeng is in the midst of struggle during a time of homesickness after recently moving from Vietnam. But as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland. As Saeng moves through the story it is apparent that she longs for memories of her homeland, but is beginning to find new things to enjoy about her new home. For example, while she is touched by the memories aroused by the hibiscus flower, she is intrigued by the new experiences, such as eating Big @CAPS1 and new friends. While homesickness has caused her to struggle she knows that with time she will be able to overcome the obstacle of leaving the old ways, for the new without completely obliterating either. She is convinced that by spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the confidence to pursue any that will arise in her future.    	3	3		3																					
2063	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng�s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. 	1	1		1																					
2065	4	"Saeng is talking about flowers coming back in the spring time. She is vowing to take the test again after the snow is gone and she is going to do it agin. �The wind was blowing harder, tearing of the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing."" So she cant wait until it is spring agin. So she can try to plant agin."	0	0		0																					
2066	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is saying when everything comes beet to the way they were she will do everything agein so thins aren�t the same as they used to be and she wants them to.	0	0		0																					
2068	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved i didn�t like it because I didn�t have many friend but in like a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friend. This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2071	4	I believe that the author chose to end with that paragraph because the paragraph represents new beginnings and starting over. When Saeng fails her driving test she has a moment of weakness, she feels lonely and then she sees a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam. In a since, the plant comforts her. �it�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here� In this quote Saeng�s mother tells her that the flower is too, out of place but yet has found the courage and determination to still grow. In the closing paragraph Saeng decides that, like the flower and the birds, she can also find the coarge to face fears. She deciedes to retake the tests.	2	2		2																					
2074	4	During  �Winter  Hibiscus�  written  by  Minfong  Ho, a young  girl  and  her  mother   to  a new place,and the  daughter  Saeng  is  having a hard time.Saeng found a plant called dok faeng-noi that reminds her of home. So  she bought it and took it home to show her mom, At first her mother was upset, she bought a @NUM1 dollar plant but then hearing her daughter is disappointment in herself, she found joy in the beautiful plant, while Saeng�s mother was cooking dinner .Saeng planted the beautiful plant and told herself when the  geese return, hibiscus is budding and its spring she will retake the test. She found strength in herself and  courage  to  do  better.  I think the author wanted to show how she gained respect for herself in the end of the passage. That is why the author ended it like she did.   	1	2		2																					
2075	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is what the whole story is about. It is about how Saeng misses home and filed the test when she bought the hibiscus. Saeng failed the test because she bought the hibiscus. She let herself by the flower and remember her home. That make her sad. In that last paragraph she is saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will be used to the new country and home, and will not fail the test. If she is tempted by something from home, she will not take it because it will make her sad. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story. It shows her getting used to the new home	2	1		2																					
2076	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� written by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to sum it at all up. The author used this to keep the reader wondering too.	1	1		1																					
2077	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they come back, saeng vowed Silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, to show that even though she failed her test she isn�t giving up and that she will persevere over this and continue to try. This ending shows the determination in Saeng�s heart. Saeng has enough determination inside of her to go on even though she failed her test and failed her grandmother to continue trying and continue to try to complete for her grandmother and herself. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story.	1	1		1																					
2078	4	Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, �� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. 	2	2		2																					
2079	4	In the story the author concludes the story in his last paragraph because he showes that even in her hardships. Saeng goes on and keeps trying to live a normal life after she had to move. For example when it says, �Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring I will take the test again.� This shows that even after one failuare you should never give up but don`t forget the past.	1	1		1																					
2080	4	The author of the story �winter Hibiscus�, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author wrote, �When they come back�in the spring� then I will take that test again�.(No). Saeng thought to herself and meant that she would move on in the spring. It also shows that Saeng could overcome failing the test. The narrative also states,��in the spring�when�this hibiscus is budding��(No). The season of spring means to symbolically start new and fresh. When the flower is budding, it is beginning a new life. Saeng is also starting fresh when she decides that she will take the test in the spring. Finally, this shows that Saeng could adopt to her new life by purchasing a familiar plant. The hibiscus helped her get through disappointing times. The geese also were a reminder that some things back home were the same. Minfong Ho concluded the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's adaptations. 	2	3		3																					
2081	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to tell people that shes going to take the test again and try. Shes going to be like the flowers but she needs time so when they budd she will.	1	1		1																					
2084	4	They used this sentence because she wants to see the flower bud and feels like she is at home again. Then she will take the test. She also will feel lucky and have a memory of home so saeng vowed silently to herself.	1	1		1																					
2085	4	 The author concludes the story with the sentence, ��when they come back  Saeng  vowed silently to her self in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again��. The story tells us most of the hard times and obstictes  Saeng has had to go through.

Saeng had a hard time trying to overcome these events and others. so I think this sentence was put at the end so the readers could see that see was going  to be ok, and overcome everything that happened know we know this special plant will help Saeng will future problems.     	2	2		2																					
2086	4	After reading the about story, �Winter Hibiscus � by Minfong Ho, I believe the quote, �when they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus the budding, then  I will take that test again.� Was put in the story for a reason. I believe that this quote concluded the story because it ashamed a tone and feeling of hope. For example, in the story it state that �Saeng day out a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it�. This shows that this plant areas a lot to here. The story tell the readon that it things lack memories of her grandmother. It represents hope to Saeng because it always brings back happy memories she once had which push here to try to overcome the loss betters. Therefore, the quote concludes the story because it about Saeng will for hope and peace. It represent that when the plant blooms in the spring she will have a new found sense of hope and happiness.	2	2		2																					
2087	4	�Winter Hibiscus�, by Minfong Ho is a story about transition to @LOCATION1 and her own ability to be strong. Saeng failed her drivers test and was dissapointed as she walked home. She stops at a florist shop because she see's a plant that she thinks is like the one she had back home. Seeing this plant again makes her remember memories from her homeland. She plants it when she gets home and vows to take a driving test again. When the geese get back. The plant is like encouragment to her.	2	2		2																					
2089	4	I think the athor includes that becaus. she mite have faeled and need more time to study to get thing @NUM1 so other than that damn new	0	0		0																					
2091	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng won�t give up & will keep trying. In the story all the memories of her old country encouraged her to be strong. For example the flower made her sad but in the end it made her better. Also in the beginning she didn�t really like new changes and she missed home, but at the end some of the same memories she had back home were in her new country. Those are the reasons I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph	2	2		2																					
2092	4	In the story �winter hibiscus� by Minfong Ho I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough strength to come back and flourish than she has enough strength to come back and take the test again. For example, in the story it says �but its strong enough to make it through the cold months.� This quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong. And Saeng sees that as if the plant is strong enough to return after a cold winter than she can return to the test after failing. Overall, I think that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants are very strong.	2	2		2																					
2096	4	He want to learn hibiscus spirits. Don't be afraid of fare. You just keep ahead, continuly to learn what you want, then you will success. like hibiscus has strong alive: fight with evironment. So, the author use this paragraph to conclude, the purpose is the Saeng will take this test again, like hibiscus will budding when spring's come	1	1		1																					
2099	4	"In @CAPS1 Ho�s �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese �slowly fading into the distance� she thought of herself. �When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. �the geese return and this hibiscus is budding� means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person. �This hibiscus is budding� states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take that test again� because it�s a new start for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will saeng."	2	2		2																					
2103	4	In the last paragraph when she siad she was going to have the test again, but in the spring when all the snow melts and the hibiscus budd's. She says that because, that is her favorit time of the year. So she will feel more confident that time. For example when she talks about the manigascar hibiscus that grows through bricks she loves hibiscuses. So she wants to take the test when she feels the best. 	1	1		1																					
2105	4	The author finishes it with this because spring time is a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test she wants to start over in the spring like the flowers do. To know that the hibiscus will grow back though now it is dying. For spring to come is a time to start a new, where babies are born, flowers are at blom and a new beggening is forming	1	1		1																					
2106	4	The concludes the sentence this way because their trying to show that Saeng is a very deterimined girl and no matter how many times she fails, she always trys again and again tell she gets it right. By doing this the author is showing what Saeng believes in and that is no matter how big or hard the chanellge is she will keep on going tell she is done what she started. Because moving was a very hard for her. She had a very hard time communicating with peolpe and just tyring to make friends cause it is not always easy be new, by moving she took a another look at things because they were different on her. But as time went by she got the hang of it so as long as you try you can be successful in it that�s what the author was trying to say by concluding it the way it was.	2	2		2																					
2108	4	The author concludes the story like that to let the readers know that the daughter saeng would come back and take the test again, she loves the Garden sotherefore she will not forget what spring did for her.	1	1		1																					
2109	4	It shows that she loves her plants. The story tells you all of the plants and how she likes them. She thinks they are all unique and that she enjoys the plants more than school or anything else.	0	0		0																					
2110	4	"Minfong who concludes "" Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph because it show @CAPS1's determination to succed in her new country despite the obstacles she faces. The winter hibiscus reminds Saeng to be strong like the hibiscus in is to endure winter or in Saeng's case to pass the driving test the text states ""....but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus ....""(Ho @NUM1). Saeng realizes she must also be ""strong"" lkie the ""winter hibiscus"" Saeng also realizes that she is beginning to adopt to the new country he wrote ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had though strange before had become almost familiar...""(Ho @NUM1).Saeng knows that she is able to adopt and is determined to succeed.

2114	4	"Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho explores one's quest for acceptance and adaptation to changes in life. Saeng is  the young in the story who is dealing with her recent move to america from her homeland in asia. after failing a test, Saeng spends an dosene amount of money on a flower. When she consoltes with her mother, Saeng silently vows something to herself. Saeng vows ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". @CAPS1 Ho chose to end the story this way because the story represents the guest for adaptation. Single-handedly, Saeng was able to say a vow to herself that showed she had accepted her new foreign home of america, even though she will always remember her homeland."	2	2		2																					
2115	4	The author concludes this paragraph in the article because is the ron faldse in love with the plant and uses for a clock to tell her when she can take the test. It your not a @CAPS1.S citizen you can only take the driver�s test once a year.	1	1		1																					
2119	4	The author ends the story like this in comparing to adapting changing or doing everything all over again for example; The geese fly  away when it gets cold but they always  come back giving their home another  chance .The Hibiscus is another  fine example , it buds  in  @DATE1  always  but  doesn�t  die  in  winter.  It always  returns . Saeng  has obviously realized  this  and vowed to  try her  drivers  test  again because it might work  this time . The author was trying to get the message spread of ,� don�t  give  up.�	1	2		2																					
2120	4	Determination, help, strength � all are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with the paragraph. First, determination is a @CAPS1 why Saeng will go back and take the test again. Saeng failed her drivers test the frst time and she wants to wait and do it again. Shes determinated to take different steps in order to pass the test. Secondly, I beleieve that help is a @CAPS1 why the author concluded with that paragraph. Saeng will need help in order to pass the test and she beleives that the hibiscus plant will help her pass and help her to do other things. The author is proving that she�ll go back and she�ll be ready. Finally, strength is the last @CAPS1 why the author chose the paragraph to end the story. Saeng beleieves that the hibiscus plant will give her the strength to pass the test. The author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and she�ll be stranger than she was before. These are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	3	2		3

This ending paragraph shows that Saeng will not give up in her struggle to adapt in this new place. Saeng has been going throug hard times; moving to the United States and failing her driver�s test. In the greenhouse Saeng even breaks down and crys. The hibiscus flower that saeng bought cost the family a lot of money, but to Saeng it was very important. This flower represented hope. When the flower buds again it would be the right time to take her driver�s test. The flower also represents adapting to a new place. As Saeng  adapts to the United States, the hibiscus adapts to the new garden. "	2	3		3																					
2122	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng changed. Saeng didn�t want to take the test and she had no confidence. In the story saengs mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for @MONEY1 because it reminded her of home. Now that Saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again. therefore Saeng has changed.	2	2		2																					
2123	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. �The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her.	3	3		3																					
2125	4	The author probally ended with this to show the feeling that Saeng will return and help out again. So Saeng must like to plant. She probaly might hep his mom with alot more things now that she can see what helping might lead too.   	0	0		0																					
2128	4	Why the counclude the story saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will will take that test again is to leave suspense. But he mean that saeng ate all the plant so next year she will have the test not to eat it. This is why the author ended the story with that.	1	1		1																					
2130	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place.	1	1		1																					
2136	4	This saying is saying that the snow has already fallen down onto their garden and when the snow melts, they will have to recrop everything again. This is a perfect conclusion to end this story. The story is talking about how the flowers grow in the spring and how saeng�s mom grows fruits and veggies in her garden. So since it snowed and their would be a while before the spring come back. Saeng has alot of planning to do in the next spring. The hibiscus will be budding and the geese will return.	0	0		0																					
2137	4	In the story I think the author concludes  that  paragraph  with  the  story  because  Saeng  is  saying  that  when  she  comes  back  or when  she next  sees  the  hibiscus  bloom  again  she  will  then  take  the  test  but  until then  she  feels  out  of  place  and  she  is no use to the  arrangements  she is living in  now  and  she  feels  uncomforatable  but  until  then  she  thinks  that she will not  be able  to do  will  until  she  is in  her  bloms  tow  a  where  it  is  horman   for  her.	2	1		2																					
2138	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because show that she will go back to the one place and will not break down like that and grif over what she has lost and have to deal with change.	1	1		1																					
2140	4	If you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you how comforting something can be that�s from your old country and in your knew one. The fact that Saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. Throughout the story it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house Many times in the story you could always �hear� that sense of love when she would call plant by its native languages name. Throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had. The author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her. Therefore that�s why he concluded the story as such. 	2	2		2																					
2142	4	The author had concluded the story with the paragraph When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because the author wanted the reader to notice how the mother and the child bond with gardening. Between the different things that author has said about Saeng and Saeng�s mother. He as in the author shows a way they have bonded they being Saeng and Saeng�s mother which I think it was fairly neat they way the author had bid out this story. It was a fairly interesting story to it kept you guessing, on the end of year seat, wondering. But I enjoyed reading that story. I had also liked how the daughter and mother were so great friends. But it was a nice thing to see with the daughter and the mother being so in touch with each other. Also, in doing this the author has shown some of his ways of thinking. The author shows us he a great mind and a good way thinking. This author is telling us a great story of a girl and her mother it sounded very good to me. This story is a gardening story of a daughter and her mom moving from Vietnam and moving to the @ORGANIZATION1 to live out the rest of their lives.	1	1		1																					
2147	4	Honestly I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she fees assured now. Maybe its a mental trial we all must face. Maybe the geese returning and the plant budding is a metaphoric test too.	1	1		1																					
2149	4	The concludes the story way because that the way he want for the gril to end it. Cause she all about them flowers, plant, animals. She likes Madagascar periwinhle. The places went she use to live is gorse with plants, animals, flowers.	0	0		0																					
2151	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus � this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as �The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.� The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is �strong enough to make it through the cold months here�. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that �many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her�. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom.	3	3		3																					
2152	4	She wanted to catch them, that was her whole goal and purpose of hunting.  Trying to catch geese. She saw her grandparents try to do it. In conclusion this is why she made that last statement.	0	0		0																					
2153	4	The author concluded the story will this paragraph because she wants the readers to understand that she didn�t give up on the plant and that she�s determine. For example the story state that Saeng said �I-I failed the test,� She felt as though she didn�t accomplish what she wanted to. So at the end of the story she said �I will take that test again.� To show what kind of person she is and she not going to just give up just because she failed the first time.	2	1		2																					
2154	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring time everything is reborn and in the spring time Saeng will be used to her surroundings. One example of this is when the author states ""she relazed that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befor had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost fimilar to her now. This means that with every season she get more used to her new home and if became more like her and with every season. Another is when the author say�s she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading to the distance.� This reminds her of her old home watching the geese."	2	2		2																					
2155	4	In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  	3	3		3																					
2156	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The concludes the story with the paragraph above because it shows Saeng is a carring person to nature. I know this because of this quote, �one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.� This quote show that she cares for the little things in nature. Another quote that show Saeng is caring towards nature is, �she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.� This shows that Saeng is very caring to a small plant, which is part of nature. So in conclusion the author concluded the story with the paragraph above to show the Saeng is a carring person towards nature.	0	0		0																					
2157	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it helps to explain the significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus are very important to her and her culture. When there hibiscus around, Saeng feels that she can do anything. That is why she failed the test in the first place. So she is saying that the next time she takes the test, she will have the strength from the hibiscus to help her pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2158	4	This shows that she has not givven up and is going to try hard to adopte and do well in this new land. It leavs a sad story off with a happy ending. The hibiscus is a sigh of hope and so is spring, this makes the en time thing be fkor, without this part the story would be a sad one, but with it is one of hope. The way that the rest of the story is told is as if this is a turning point or an end to the en time boot. It is on resa lution without a resolution.	1	2		2																					
2163	4	The author ended this story with this paragraph because thats now Saeng felt. She felt connteced  to the geese  and the hibiscus ,� She had lifted her head and watched as their distinctive was etched ,�  � almost familiar to her now ,� She will retake the test in the spring . The hibiscus and the flower will make he feel better in the spring . she should pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2165	4	�When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself .in the spring ,when the snow melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again �.So which mean when they come back she has to make a test up ,so they don�t have to worry about it later.But  on there trip they seen a lot of different thing ,the soil was cold and hard they couldn�t much with it.She though it was walking into another world ,hot, moist world exploding with with greenery @CAPS1  frends and ones of shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion .And beside it was yet another old  friend a small shrub with waxy leaves and the dainty flower with the purplish petals and white centers .It was already dusk when Saeng reach home ,the wind was blowing hard tearing off last remants of green in the chicory weeds that grew thre the crack of the sidwak .So @CAPS2 to they saw a lot of thing on their trip.So saw thing  they never  seen before like the wed growin therw the sidewalk.	1	0		1																					
2166	4	I think the author includes this to show the determination to pass this test no matter what.	1	1		1																					
2170	4	"�then I will take that test again� [@NUM1] Saeng�s whole intention in the story was to take the test and pass it. Houever, ""I-@CAPS1] failed the test, [Ho, @NUM2] which brought the whole story together. She yearned for comfort as she seeked the �@CAPS2 Malik� [Ho, @NUM3] for comfort. Seeing this brought back all the memories of her life �back home� [@NUM1] that kept her going. As a result, bonding with her mother erupted, and it brought another day of hope for her future in her new home. Enough hope for her to say, �when they come back in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�"	1	2		2																					
2172	4	"The autor of ""winter Hibiscus"" conclded the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeg is going to give the test another try. The author wanted to slow that saeg was not going to giving up in that when the thing that was most important to her was complete that she would then take the test again. In the sory it says that ""saeg did not dare look at her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus is what was important t"	2	2		2																					
2175	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has overcome an obstacle in her life and that she is learning to move on. In the story Saeng is often stuck on past memories rather than making new ones. For example, when Saeng goes to the florist shop to purchase the plant, she starts remembering old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled �jasmine�, she thinks of her grandmother that died and remembers how she used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair. Also, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is �not a real one� and she also says it�s �not like the kind we had before.� @CAPS1, she keeps comparing her new life to her old life in her homeland and she does not allow her new experiences to be as good as her old ones. @CAPS1 when the author concludes the story with that paragraph, it shows growth in the girl, Saeng, and that she is willing to move on and make new memories, such as trying to pass her driving test again.	2	2		2																					
2176	4	The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because the story is coming to and end. The author putting that sweet touch on its saying it will become string again and the beautiful flowers will blossom. Letting the readers know that the nature will continue, The season will come back around.	0	0		0																					
2181	4	The meaning of the last phrase is to see if the winter hibiscus canre seed and go threw everything to become a flower for the year and repeat the process. 	0	0		0																					
2182	4	Minfong Ho concluded �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph to show hope and renewal for the character Saeng. Spring represents birth and renewal, a second chance for Saeng. She had previously failed what seems to be an important test (perhaps her citizenship test), and motivated her to try and remember her past, which she sorely misses. The winter hibiscus seems to represent herself, and this illustrates it: �it�s-it�s not a real one,� Saeng mumbled she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. �Not like the kind we had before� I know her mother said quietly' 'its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That is what matters. This describes Saeng�s position perfectly � she is not the same, as happy as she once was, but she can make it through the hard times, and can bloom in the spring to take the test again. This shows the purpose of the last paragraph in �winter hibiscus� to show the renewal and hope that Saeng will experience.	3	2		3																					
2183	4	I think that this sentence was choosen to be the last sentence because it shows that Saeng can pass the test. Although she is not at her homeland she still has the ability to do things. As the plant that reminds of home returns and begins to grow Saeng will do the same. I think that it is a good sentence to be at the end and it leaves you wondering if she will pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2187	4	I think the author used that response because she was showing that she had to go through another @DATE1 or hard work in planting flowers.	0	0		0																					
2188	4	The author concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus � the way she did because she wanted to show saeng �s determination at one point in the story, the author wrote, �she was still too shaky to say the words at home �.  Saeng really missed her old life and her old country. She often wonders when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself, because she still has trouble adjusting to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that saeng could be shown as a person   who would not easily give up. Although she�d had   previous trouble, the end of the story gives new hope for saeng to adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives newhopes saeng told her mother,�I failed the test �, and she was really down on herself when she said so. The closing sentence gives new hope to saeng and the reader,  that she will work header and do better in the spring. The author shows saeng�s determination to rise above failure   and create a niche of her own in life. In all, the closing sentence in �winter Hibiscus� is used to show saeng�s determination.	3	3		3																					
2190	4	"The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", with a very spiritual and confident paragraph to show that hope has an important part in our lives. In the story, �Saeng"", a foreign chinese citizen, is touched and flattened by all the majestic plants and nature that was living in the green house. She ventures to find all the plants that remind her of home and to relate them to her past experiences. As she walks through the green house, she whispers and pronounces the names of the nature she sees, �Saebba"", Saeng whispered, �Madagascar periwinkle�, its tag pronounced. �How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild.!! But as her tour grew with time, she soon relizes she is missing some of her memories, and begins to cry. As she reaches home she is greeted by her mother. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. Saeng's mother is touched by her comment, and cheers her up with planting the �hibiscus"". In the end, the author shows strong expression by writting one last paragraph to bring out hope, and emotion, to represent that everyone deserves a second chance."	3	2		3																					
2191	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he basically saying hes never taking that test again. The author is showing that the character doesn�t like this test. And would rather not take it	0	0		0																					
2192	4	The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about over coming obstacles and is telling the reader to try again. It is important to never give up and to keep trying until you sucede. In the story Saeng had just moved away from Vietnam she really missed it, and on top of it saeng failed her drivers test. She was really upset. She saw a group of geese flying above her and said when they come back in the spring and my new plant starts to grow I will retake my drivers test. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter. The cold weather is an obstacle for them. Also her new plant can't grow until its warm. Her plant has to over come being small until it can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time. You have to keep trying inorder to get around them.	3	3		3																					
2194	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the motivation and confidence Saeng has after her experience with the plant. there are many reasons and examples that support this. One reason is, he want to show the change in Saeng after he first test and when she boaght the flower to releive her. For example, after she failed the driving test, Saeng goes to the Florist. When she see this plant, he childhood comes back and she forgets her test. This flower motivates her to get her lisence. Another reason is, it shows how confident this experience has made her. For example, after failing, she comes back saying,� ... I will take the test again.� In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to show how confident Saeng has become over her experience.	2	2		2																					
2195	4	The author concludes that statement at  the story at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng wont give up just like the hibiscus.For example the hibiscus does its  best to survive in the winter and blooms and starts over in the spring.Saeng will also survive the winter and star all over again in the spring and retake the test. The author  wanted  to  show  the readers that Saeng is the hibiscus in a way that she has to start over and retry what she has failed as if the hibiscus had died in the winter.	2	2		2																					
2196	4	My response is that if is about winter so realy it is going to be about witer walking around having fun and all them thing.	0	0		0																					
2198	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he wants to show that the flower was her inspiration to take the test before. The way I got my response was, throughout the story, @PERSON1 was always either gardening the hibiscus or had one. This obviously showed me that she was inspired by this flower and its beuty. In conclusion, the author ends the story like this to show the importance of the Hibiscus flower to Saeng.	1	1		1																					
2202	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story that paragraph because, she wants to show the determination the girl in the story possess. At first, the girl could not help herself and bought the expensive flower. She did not want her mother to be disappointed though, so she was determined to ""pass the test."" In the spring when it is time to buy more seeds, the girl wants to be able to buy the seeds. So the author is showing the trait of determination that the girl controls."	1	1		1																					
2206	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show the aduiance that Saeng @CAPS1 gave up so you should'nt either. I think that this paragraph is describin a law of life witch is �@CAPS1 give up.� @CAPS2 even though she had failed at first she is still willing to try again.	1	1		1																					
2207	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things	0	0		0																					
2209	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will follow  nature  and  try to  fit  into her  new  land. Saeng  has failed  her  driver�s   test  and  feels  out  of place  in  her  new home. The text states, �As  Saebba  nedae  tall  and  lush. And  surrounded  there  garden� (No 1).When  she  sees  the @CAPS1 it reminds her of old home where she fit in.Now she  wants to wait to see  that flower  grown  so when she takes the driver�s test again.Also,she sees geese fly over her head when she plants he r flower. The  author  writes. ��She  realized  that  many  of  the  things that she had thought strange before  had become�almost  familiar  to  her how�(No @NUM1).The geese coming back in the spring will now  also  remind her  of  her  new  name  and  how  must  try  to  live  there happily now. In the last paragraph the  author writes,� I will take that test again�(No @NUM1).This gives the feeling of Saeng  trying to start a  new  beginning in this new home.  	3	3		3																					
2211	4	I think the author is just trying to show that you never give up. I think the author is trying to show the beautie of nature. The author used that because in the story Saeng failed the test but at the end it says that she will take the test again. In the story it talks about the winter hibiscus that she planted and that is concluded in the conclusion. The conclusion basiclly saying is there will be a new beginning.	1	1		1																					
2213	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the readers know that she doesnt give up. They @MONTH1 have thought that she thaght the test back home were more important. So she wouldnt care about passing this test because she misses her home and wouldnt care about those test.	1	1		1																					
2214	4	I think that the auther end the story Like that as a meterphor For people to think out side the @CAPS1 or thing. OR The auther might oF ended it Like that so people can get a picture in the head about what she was talking about.	0	0		0																					
2215	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to give You an idea of how she feels about what happened to her. This paragraph is her telling herself that everything is ok and she going to do better next time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to make Saeng sound more confident in herself. In the middle of the story when she was having the conversation with her mother, she sounded unconfident with herself so this paragraph made her sound like she was sure with herself, like she knew what she was going to do.	2	1		2																					
2216	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�, I think that the author concludes the story in �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is dudding, then I will take that test again� because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and make new flowers the Saeng should do the same. Therefore thats why the author added that quet to the end of the story	2	1		2																					
2218	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the end she realizes that the things that seemed strange before she had just realized as the seasons were changing and the plants. So the author put that paragraph at the end because in the spring she goes back to school to take the test again	1	1		1																					
2219	4	The author concludes the story the way he or she dose because it shows that the time she found the plant that she will get her lisens So it is a reminder for her. I also think she did it that way because when the plant blooms it starts over and so when she sets on gose to take a chance at the test she is starting new	1	1		1																					
2224	4	In the story the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric, I say this because she is comporing herself to the hibiscus plant. As a hibiscus would be tested to over come conditions such as the cold and forexample in the test the author states � its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus�. She as the hibiscus will bloom again and have to pass the test of surviving the cold, will be able to have a chance to pass her own test, that is why the author concludes the story as she did.	2	2		2																					
2225	4	The concluding paragraph in the story �Winter Hibiscus �portrays the powerful massage of change from a cold, distant failure to adapt, to a new life. Saeng relates her transformation to the changing seasons from winter to spring . this is obvious shown it states  �in the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding . she accepts this as a new chance to start fresh , and then try to pass the test. The change from winter  to spring symbolize saeng�s hardship  of flying to adapt to her new home. And then, as the geese   return and the hibiscus is  adapting in its new environment is the symbol by which saeng  follows as it is from her old home in Vietnam, but can now  also prosper elsewhere. 	3	2		3																					
2226	4	 The  author concludes with this because it had the most impact. The ending also gave the most meaning. The meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again, this could have a double meaning, and mean that the authors life will bloom again. Overall it was a good way to conclude the paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2230	4	The story is full of emotion and homesickness that it can be a bit depressing, so the author wanted to end with message of hope. After saeng failed the test �in the maint shelter of the greenhouse (she) broke down and wept,� it�s inspiring to know that she�ll keep tryinh despite all her hardship. I know first hand that homesickness can be pretty bad, and finding the strength to keep going and make the promise� to take that test again� can be very hard but worthwhile .  The author also used the ending to give another meaning to the hibiscus for �when the geese return  and the hibiscus is blooming � when the winter is over hard times are past, there will be new hope in a new, beautiful spring. 	3	2		3																					
2232	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the growth or hope that Saeng has that she will be comfortable in the United States. When she said “I-I failed the test,” I took it as failing the test to see if she got over her country and if   	1	1		1																					
2233	4	"In the story ��winter hibiscus by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.�� @CAPS1 is shows that you should fight. For whats right and what you belive in."	0	0		0																					
2234	4	Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower.	1	2		2																					
2236	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author concludes this story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has confidence to take the driving test.	1	1		1																					
2238	4	Saeng feels out of place in her new home and new country. She vows silently that in a year she will take the test again. She vows that in a year she will be used to her new home and new country and will start to enjoy life again. The author concluded with this paragraph because the girl Saeng will hopefully enjoy her new home and in a year she will be used to what happens in her new country. Saeng just feels out of place and she wants to wait a while until she tries to retake the test. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she made a vow to herself and hopefully she will keep the vow and make it happen.	2	1		2																					
2239	4	The author might of concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isnt @CAPS1 to stop trying shes @CAPS1 to work harder. As she sees the Geese adapting she chooses to try. and make their wew home work out. After they disapear she picks herself up and says that shes @CAPS1 to try again. By doing this she is commiting herself to try @CAPS2 things t adapt to changes.	2	2		2																					
2240	4	I think she ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test in the @DATE1 time when it won�t be so hard on her. It will be warm again and it�s not quite as cold.	1	1		1																					
2242	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too. �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. �I choose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happen she can to. She should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do.	2	1		2																					
2243	4	Authors often end stories with paragraph that make readers wonder what happens next. In Winter Hibiscus by: Minfong Ho there is an ending paragraph just like that. The author ends it like this because she is looking towards the future. She says that she will take the test when the snow melts, the gesse come back, and the hibiscus bluming. She is looking at it like that is a new beggining. She wants to start over. Also the gesse, blooming hibiscus, and melted show gives her hope that she will pass her test. She belives now they have a hibiscus maybe it will be more like where she use to live. Authors use endings that make people wonder so people think. 	2	1		2																					
2244	4	The response that the author concludes the story with this peragraph because  the author wanted us that read the story to understanding what was going on in the story. like for the @CAPS1 they was sayin when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibicus is budding then I will take that test again, was tryin to see where everybody head at in the story so they can understanding what the author be talkin about.	0	0		0																					
2245	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the geese and the hibiscus were both things that were familiar to Saeng They remind her of her homeland,When  the familiar things return ,she will have the strength to the test again and hopefully do better.The narrator says �Overhead a of Canada geese flew by,their faint hunks clear and �yes-fimiliar to Saeng now �.This shows how the geese are a symbol of the fimilar things from her homeland that help Saeng feel more comfortable in her new home.	1	2		2																					
2248	4	"The author concludes this story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, whe the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take the test again"". She does this because in the story this plant has given her a lot of beilef in herself to @MONTH1 be do better in the future."	1	1		1																					
2249	4	The author concludes the story this ways for a few reasons. One reason is that she will have more experience with her new country. She only left her homeland a few months before so in about six more months she will be more knowledgable about the ways of the new country. This will make her more capable of passing the @CAPS1 Ed test. Also in the spring is when the flower will be beautiful again and this will give her new-found strength that will cause her to pass. The few months time will allow the author time to mentally and physically prepare for the exam. Mentally, she will be able to study and learn all she needs to know. And physically she will age which will also teach her new things.	1	2		2																					
2250	4	In order to get over her failure, Saeng bought a flower that reminded her of home. Saeng�s started to cry when she bought the flower. She wanted to be back home. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show how she will take the test when she feels like she is at home. �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� Saeng said to herself. Those things make her feel welcome and feeling that way will help her with her test. The paragraph concludes the story with all the things she is comfertable with. This conclusion helps the reader understand what reminds her of home. Also explains how much the hibiscus flower ment to her. Buying the flower helps her with her troubles. Seeing the geese fly reminds her of her home. The author concludes the story with the memories that will help Saeng in the future.	2	2		2																					
2251	4	I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because, every one should have fresh starts, or second chances. I guess the author was leaving in a message stating if you fail once you should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test it seems as though her self-esteem lowered, and her mother tried cheering her up, and eventually she realized it will be bad giving up and not trying again with a fresh start.	1	1		1																					
2257	4	The author concludes with with paragraph because Saeng has to take the test all over. She @MONTH1 think theres a better chance when it blooms and the snow melts. So that is when Saeng is going to try and take the test after the snow melts and the hibiscus blooms	1	1		1																					
2258	4	The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can�t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2259	4	I think that the authoR includes this paRagRaph in this stoRy b/c the gRandmothER might think that it is a tEst to sEE what she can gEt donE @CAPS1 time. The gRandmotheR might gEt more done then should @CAPS2.	0	0		0																					
2260	4	I think that the author concludes the story like that because @MONTH1 be she�s saying that by that time she�ll be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @MONTH1 be by that time when that happens in spring she would be preprared and more confident of herself. @MONTH1 be the author was trying to say that just like the begining of a new springs, it would be a new beginning for her.	2	1		2																					
2263	4	the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng�s mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2265	4	Including the bit about taking the test again when the �hidiscus is budding� provides a sense of closeur and lesson to an otherwise open ending. Saeng fails the drivers test early in the story, then on her way home she buys a hibiscus. The reader really doesn�t see a connection until this last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perserverence and strength. After a harsh winter this hibiscus can bloom again and ard continue to live. Even after moving from Vietnam, and struggling to adapt, Saeng must recover, ard keep trying. Just like the flower blooming again, so will Saeng. She will take the test a second time and pass. She will adapt to her environment, and keep going, just like the hibiscus.	3	2		3																					
2266	4	The  author concludes  the  story  with  the  paragraph  � When  they  come  back  ,  Saeng  vowed  silently  to  herself  in  the  spring  ,  when  the   snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is  budding  ,  the  I  will  take  the   test  again ,�  because  the  author  started  out  the  story  after  Saeng  failed  her  driving  test  .  Saeng  is  reminded  from  the  Hibiscus  about  her  homeland.  After  Saeng  wanted  the  Hibiscus  in  the  garden  ,�  a  flock  it  canada geese  flow by �,  as  they  flew  by  Saeng  felt  a  sign  at  comfort  and  vowed  to  herself  what  started  everything  .  If  Saeng  did  pass  the  driving  test  then  she  would  of  never  found  the  Hibiscus.	1	2		2																					
2267	4	The author include it because her mother took the test and passed it and the daughter wanted to do the same Just like her mom. And she can only take it in the spring because there is no flowers out in the winter.	0	0		0																					
2271	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author includes this ending paragraph because she wants to show that next time around she will be prepared and ready for the garden and the challenges it holds. This first time, she wasn�t ready, and she didn�t know about the winter hisbiscus because she never did anything like it before.	0	0		0																					
2273	4	The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.	1	1		1																					
2275	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because it�s telling how Saeng  feel about winter being near and how she have to wale  until spring come back around to do her teast again.  	1	1		1																					
2276	4	Saeng cares about the flowers. She cares about the flower. Natural occurrence with them growing unique.	0	0		0																					
2277	4	In the story I don�t know why the author and the story with that I really don�t know, maybe she was talking about she took all test now she wouldn�t take it over again atey. The times come. She in school and when one took the test of was that kind of wealth now that of not of is @DATE1 and school is over. 	0	0		0																					
2278	4	Why the author concludes this paragraph into the story is because at the end off the story they needed and ending. Also why is because the picked and conclusion that would best fit this story.	0	0		0																					
2284	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because, he wanted to show that she wasn�t going to give up just because she failed one time. She failed the test one time already. She was very sad about it. She went and bought a plant. Saeng�s mom told her that they were going to do it the right way. Saeng was crying when she told her mom about it. Her mom was very understanding thought. Her  mom could have been very mad with her. She could of used a plant that they grew. The plant @MONTH1 not grow right now. She should of bought a real plant from someone else.	1	1		1																					
2285	4	Determined, new beginning, symbolism � each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she�s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, �and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,� it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism � each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.	2	3		3																					
2286	4	The author of � Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho end the story with the statement, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again,� because it showed that Saeng had overcome her problem and vowed to correct it. By ending with this statement the author showed that the beauty of nature can help one to overcome their problems, as did Saeng. Upon seeing the Geese  mignitry and the �Winter  Hibiscus� Saeng, �realized that many of the things that she had thought  of as strange before had become, through the guiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.� Saeng realized that the test although strange and different to her now became familiar because of her experiences with nature. Seeing the geese and �Winter Hibiscus�. This plant also made Saeng think of her past in Vietnam and all of one good times back at her home. �The familiar  fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could  almost fast the light strures of her grandmothers long gray hair, freshly mashed.� The jolont made her think of good experiences. In the plant made her joyous enough not to think about past, but about the future, about taking the test again and her new life in the United States   	3	3		3																					
2287	4	The reason why the author puts that last line into the story of the end is to show us the raids  and saeng  that even though us almost over. She doesn�t want  it to end but she know that it will also start up again. Next year when things goes back to the way they were before everything changed. This is why I think the author put that line into the story.	0	0		0																					
2288	4	The author concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again� to express her determination of fitting into new things and to express the change she was getting used to. Describing spring was important in the conclusion because it described what Saeng once thought was odd in @LOCATION1, but got used to the seasons and weather changing. Once she realized that she needed to deal with change, she knew that she would need to try the driving test again. It was very important that the author�s conclusion was �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because it expressed how Saeng was accepting change in her life.  	2	2		2																					
2290	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng�s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2292	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she overcame and she wants to re take the quiz for herself and to prove it to herself no one else. she states �when they come back, saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. So she says that she wants to retake the test. So she is not being pressured into taking it. She is taking it to prove to herself no one else.	1	2		2																					
2294	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to make the reader want more. When an author ends the chapter of a story or an episode of a show it is always a good idea to use a cliffhanger to drag the audience along. In many stories have read this is used. In my @CAPS1, the @PERSON1 book it always ends with a cliff-hanger. Like in the end of the third book one of the soldiers is killed but you don�t find out by who until the next book.	1	1		1																					
2296	4	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold so she would wait until the snow melts and geese return to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother.	0	0		0																					
2298	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you�ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way.	2	2		2																					
2301	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story Saeng went to take a driving test but didn�t pass and so she goes and buys a hibiscus that reminds her of home and gives her strength and comfort. So her mother says this at the end because she knows Saeng is going through a hard time adapting to her new country and she doesn�t want to put more pressure on her just because she knows Saeng is very upset and is trying to make it up to her by buy a flower for her so she says by next spring she should be adapted and ready for the test because the flower should give her hope. She wants her to know she is three for her.	1	2		2																					
2302	4	I think the author of �Winter Hibiscus� said �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.� to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn�t giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way.	1	1		1																					
2303	4	The author of the Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with the paragraph to show the connection between the hibiscus and @CAPS1. The hibiscus has to survive the winter until spring were it can bloom and became big and beautiful. @CAPS1 is connecting to the flower and saying she can make it through her obstacles that come with the change in enviroment if the flower can deal with being confined in a plastic container and surviving the weather. She feels that right now she's likes the Hibiscus. She�s trapped because the area is alien to her and she has to adjust. Just as the container is alien to the flower because it�s used to being free. But once it�s planted, it will become a part of it's surroundings and grow. And once she accepts the change and becomes willing to start over, she will begin to grow and that will cause her driving test to be easier. In conclusion, this is the reason the author concluded the paragraph with this sentence.	3	3		3																					
2304	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus�, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test �when the snow melts and the geese return.� I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver�s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author�s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver�s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  	3	3		3																					
2305	4	The author probably includes part of the story with the paragraph to put more details into the paragraph. The author trying to talk about the life that Saeng had vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again, saying that when flowers start blooming again and spring comes around again thats when I will take that test and pass this time.	1	1		1																					
2306	4	"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, �Its not a real one�  ""Not like the kind we had before.� Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered."	2	1		2																					
2307	4	The author concludes this the story with this paragraph   because its start a whole new  day time . That saying  means  that  she  will  take  the  test on a budding  new day .for  example, the   geese  return  her its spring and  hibiscus budd  and  she  has the test  in  the spring  so it  will  start  why the author concludes the  story  with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2311	4	"I believe that the author ends because the author is showing that Saeng is determined to pass the test. ""She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes. ""(Ho) This quote shows that passing the test meant a lot to Saeng. She was crying because she couldn't help but buy the plant and fail the test. She didn't want to fail and showed her sadness by crying.� then I will take the test again.� (Ho) This quote shows that even though she failed, she is determined to pass the test and succeed. Failing hurt her greatly. so she can't wait to do it again and pass because she is determing to succeed. This is all important because Saeng shows that determination is the key to success and she is determined."	1	2		2																					
2312	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story to show saeng determination and her adaption to her new home. This shows her determination because it say �I will take that test again."" This also shows that she has adapt to her new home."	1	1		1																					
2314	4	"In the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph with Saeng vowing she will take the test again in the spring. Minfong used this paragraph because it means never give up, even if you fail the first time. For example, Saeng just failed her drivers test but after buying the Hibiscus and taking deeper into things she realized she shouldn�t give up."	1	2		2																					
2315	4	The author concludes with this sentence for emphasis. It takes Saeng�s mind off of the flower and she focuses on her test. By waiting until next spring to take the test it gives her something to look forward to. This statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do. The author ends on a good note explaining this, The last paragraph is also a break from the rest of the story and from what Saeng�s was just doing. It is Saeng�s last and final thoughts.	2	2		2																					
2316	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.�	0	0		0																					
2319	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too.	2	3		3																					
2321	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when Saeng was saying this to herself, she made a promise to not give up getting her license and the hibiscus makes her feel like she is at home again. In the text when the mother says, ""@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thats what matters.� when she says this it makes Saeng not sad because she knows that the hibiscus will remind her of the hibiscus at home and that gives her the power to want to try again in the spring."	2	2		2																					
2327	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because It meant a lot to Saeng. Saeng failed her driving test and scared to tell her mother that she also spent nineteen dollars for �Dok Faeng-noi which was a flower/plant they had back at home. For example, �As Saeng walks home after failing her driver�s test, she sees a familiar plant.� The plant Saeng saw meant a lot to her mother. �@PERSON1 uttered a small cry of surprise and delight.� Dok faeng-nor� she said. �where did you get it.� That was a quote stating that her mother was excited to hear that. The story is concluded by that paragraph because after all saeng went through her mother was glad she bought it. �It�s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng- noi,� she finally said. �I�m glad you got it.�	1	1		1																					
2332	4	From the story of the girl just moved from Vietnam to United @ORGANIZATION1. It will be hard for the girl to understand anything and anything can bring her memory back about Vietnam. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she did fail the test and see wants to see the hibiscus is budding. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said it to her mother. Her mother actually understand why it happen and she will let Saeng keep the hibiscus because it will make Saeng feel better. Saeng miss Vietnam a lot and will like to try her best to overcome obstacles.	2	2		2																					
2334	4	The author finished off the story with that paragraph because the paragraph is saying that overtime when she is adapted well to every thing she will be able to take the test, so that�s why she says ��and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,�� �@CAPS1 that all it needs is time. Time to get warm and time to grow. Also the paragraph is well thought out and relates to the entire story. So she concluded with a great paragraph that made a lot of sense in relationship with the story.	1	1		1																					
2335	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, Ho concludes the story with the paragraph due to the fact the flower represents her hapiness from her home. The flower symbolizes the past and comfort, once Saeng began to dig the ""winter hibiscus"" In, ""she could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now,"" All of Saeng�s sense were beginning to return; she was happy, likewise, the author uses the geese to explain the comfort of Saeng. The country around her began to feel like home. She became familiar with her surroundings. Many references to home was made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness. therefore, Saeng would gain more confidence, which explans the reason @CAPS1 Ho concluded with that sentence."	3	2		3																					
2337	4	She concludes that paragraph with the story because she realy wants the people to realize that she is and and is always having fun. Also that she love where she at. Shes making in the world and she loves wathing flower, �geese return and this hibiscus is budding� that show that her favorite thing to do  that she loves is flowers.	0	0		0																					
2339	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he/she is trying to put across the message that the plant shows a symbol of new beginings which is a symbol of saeng�s vowe. Also in the story caring for the plant teaches saeng responsablity in obtaining her license by care for the plant it will teach her patients and that she needs to learn from mistakes made.	1	1		1																					
2341	4	The author concludes this in the story to show tone. The paragraph shows how Saeng was determined to try again a pass. This teaches a lesson to the reader. Lessons to try your hardestand don�t give up. The last paragraph ends the story with a sence of curiosity. It makes you want to no more or if she passes.	1	1		1																					
2342	4	I think that the concluding paragraph means after everything   else   important and what is meant to happen happens then she will take the test because its  basically the last  thing has to happen and I think she will pass it because it meant to happen.	1	1		1																					
2344	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with  the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because it emphasizes Saeng pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes Saeng�s resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads �And besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.� This excerpt demonstrates Saeng�s love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news �I-I failed the test� @CAPS1 attention instantly was drawn to the flower and her mother could only be good. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is Saeng�s source of stength as it�s the only thing she knows in the united states. Saeng wants to show the same resolve on her test that the  flower shows in the harsh winter."	2	2		2																					
2345	4	The author concludes the story with the afore mentioned paragraph to represent the connection between the return of the hibiscus�s bids, and the return of Saeng�s resolve. In the photograph for question #@NUM1, the hibiscus flower is out of place, as if it doesn�t belong similar to Saeng. The hibiscus represented the link to Saeng�s past, as portrayed when the author writes: �Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.� The hibiscus was native to her homeland, and by helping Saeng to remember her past, she began to cope with the present, and later the future, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.	2	2		2																					
2346	4	By this quote, the author is explaining that Saeng will eventually be ready for her test. When the geese return, they're ready to return From their migration and when the hibiscus is budding, it is ready to turn into a beautiful flower. Saeng believes that in the spring, since the flower and the geese are ready, she too will be ready.	2	1		2																					
2350	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph is that the author is showing  that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding she said silently to her self that she is going  to take the permit again. 	0	0		0																					
2353	4	The author in this story explaynes how hard some changes can be. The author also explayns how family and object frome home such as the flower can be comforting. The meaning of the story is to show one of the author expierances in life.	1	1		1																					
2354	4	I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it wasn�t it for the little girl and she wasn�t going to give up on planting flower and that when the spring come and the snow had melt she was going to plant some more flower and see how they will do during the spring even though that it didn�t work as well as the winter season she did let her stop her I think the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesn�t work keep on trying maybe something different will happen.	0	0		0																					
2356	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One reason is because It leaves you knowing that Saeng will never give up tring. Another reason is that something as simple as a flower can encourage someone to keep going even if they have nothing to go for. Saeng says that flower is something so important, that working harder will encourage her to keep doing the best she can. The author leaves you with this sentence because it is very powerful and brings Saeng courage.  	2	1		2																					
2363	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story. In the my opinion the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story in order to show Saeng is committed to adjusting  to her new home and to leaving her old one. For example, in the story Saeng was unable to say �I mean, not like the kind we had at home.� without bursting into tears. This illustrates her sorrow and inability to let go of her past.	1	2		2																					
2364	4	The author could have finished the story with that paragraph for many reasons. He/she probably finished with the paragraph to show that Saeng cared about adapting to her new place and was not a failure or quiter. The author also probably finished the story this way to show that Saeng was determined for success and to make her mother happy. This is why the author finished the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2366	4	The author concludes her story with this statement for many reasons. First the Hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing. therefore, Saeng will be strong too. Also, Saeng is giving herself time to adjust and get used to her new surroundings. She is setting a real goal for herself. Saeng is identifieng with the flower. It gives her comfort, and brings back valuable memories of the things she loved and the things that made her happy, like her home country, and her grandmother.	1	2		2																					
2371	4	They author must have put this in the story to show change. For all giving things is we give we do e them we replemise the author. People dont think about the small damages, there nuste comrade with the big changes. The small ones count the turnig sioteero & I have to bind as for. On top of that the old anges to drive. We all go through harsh big & small, but we need to over come them all	0	0		0																					
2373	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it concludes, and wraps up the story. It shows the relationship between nature, adapting, and how this all calmed her down after failing the test.	1	1		1																					
2374	4	The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter into spring the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will blosom into different colored flowers. After all the flowers had blosomed the leaves had come out and then the pollin had found the right kind of trees . At the end of @DATE2 into fall the leaves start to die and change color then the leaves will fall off. Then it snows all over again.	0	0		0																					
2377	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s outlook on the future. It is a fitting conclusion, drawing from numerous elements in the story, and it shows how Saeng has grown. Saeng refers to �When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� In this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland. The geese are �familiar to Saeng now � despite her thinking of them as �strange before.� The hibiscus is a piece of her past, adapted to fit her current situation. Saeng�s vow that she will �take that test again� in the spring, �When the snows melt��etc. This shows that despite losing so much - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the best of her situation. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what. The concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story. It was how the thrends of Saeng�s past and her present are entwined , and displays her attitude towards the future. With its optimistic words the final paragraph nearly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret. The author�s wording was very well done.	3	3		3																					
2378	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story it says ""I will take that test again."" So she's trying to say she will she how much she have adjusted to changes in life. In the story it also states ""when they come back"" That concludes that when the flower's come back next season. She will she how much she reminber about her homeland, her grandma and the good things."	1	1		1																					
2380	4	Now that she knows a lot about plants the narrator makes it seem like the girl is interested in @CAPS1.R.@CAPS1. The new world and different plants that bloom and look so beautiful in the season so the way I see it is that the girl really enjoys the plants and the characteristic to me I say she is an adventurous girl who likes to explore new worlds and see what is out there to be explained.	0	0		0																					
2382	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl. By vowing to take the �test� again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality.	1	1		1																					
2384	4	The author included this sentence in the paragraph because Saeng was a very determined girl. She would keep trying till she got it right. No matter how long or hard it would be she would get it done. Just like from the picture of the Hibiscus flower next to the highway. It certainly woked out of place, but it would do anything to survive. Being strong at times when you can only depend on yourself is hard to do, but Saeng is determined from her loss and the perfection of the Hibiscus flower.	2	2		2																					
2385	4	In the concluding statement Saeng states that �when they come back In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The author concludes the story with this passage because she is using the hibiscus as an example of survival. The hibiscus isfrom another place like her, and she is using it to represent her well being in the new place. In a way she is saying , If the hibiscus survives this winter, than so will I. I believe she uses this as a conclusion to depict her unsure nature towards her new home.	2	3		3																					
2388	4	The  reason  the author was inspired was because of the flower. The flower had the ability to survive harsh winters and adapt to and new environments. She decides that she was going to over comes its obstacles just as the flower over comes its obstacles every winter.	2	1		2																					
2389	4	Memory,promise,life-all are ideas that explain why the author concludes the  story with this paragraph.Memories is one  idea that helps explain why the author concludes this story  with  this paragraph because saeng misses her old life and country.Promise is another idea because saeng makes a vow that once spring comes again she will take the test again.Life is another idea because saeng brought the flower and planted soit can live once spring has come and she said  the n she will  retake the test. Memories, promise, and life help explain why the author conclude the story with this paragraph. Memories will come back in the spring along with the promises she has made and the that wants to start and saeng is doing this by pla nting the hibiscus which brings back a lot of her memories from her life	2	2		2																					
2390	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it had gotten colder and all the plants and flowers were going to die.	0	0		0																					
2392	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�, Saeng had failed her drivers test and as she is walking home she spies a flower that reminds her of what once her home. She buys the flower and returns to her new home to her mother who is working in the garden. They decide to plant the flower in the garden, and when the flower was planted, a flock of geese fly over head, Saeng then realizes that everything is familier to her now, when everything was quite strange to her. She concludes the story saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will take the test again. She says that the flower will be buckling which means blooming or growing, and she will have been grown and familiar to everything then, so she will be ready for the test when the geese as ready to come home and the hibiscus is ready to bloom	2	2		2																					
2393	4	The author does this because they are comparing to the plant. The author does this because when the plant starts to bloom then the character�s confidence will come back. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it gives the story some meaning.	1	1		1																					
2395	4	I think this Author put this last paragraph in this story is to show everyone how determined she is to pass this test and how much it means to her to do it so that is what I think Why the Author Would put this in the story 	1	1		1																					
2396	4	The  author  concludes  the  story  of  paragraph  with the paragraph because it show the connection of nature and the girl. The paragraph says,��when the snow  melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again�(No @NUM1).In spring when all of these events take place. Spring is the  sign  of  life  and  birth  or  renewal. The geese come back. They are �renewed� in a symbolic sense. When the snow melts you can see the grass again which is a sign of life. When plants bud they are born. The  character  decides  when  nature  is symbolically reborn  and  renewed she  will start again just like nature.	2	3		3																					
2397	4	he concludes the sTory  with his paRagRaph because he wanted To say That he was going To Take The Test again when it was not The winTeR @CAPS1 and show how saeng vowed to heRself By saying that he oR she will take The Test again when it is not winTeR because even @CAPS2 the Test was not passed in winteR and could have been passed duRing when TheRe snow melted in the gRound	1	1		1																					
2398	4	In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel.	0	0		0																					
2400	4	Saeng and her mother have to be determined to try their best in order to survive. Saeng and her mother has been thourgh a lot and when she failed the @CAPS1 test, she was more depressed than before, The author concludes this story with this paragraph to give readers the thought oF how it is to be determined to adapt and survive in a different place and though Saeng and her mother are away from their homeland they still enjoy the things they did in Vietnam, like the flowers, and the hot peppers and bitter melons, her friends disagree with the taste but it doesnt stop her from enjoying what she loves most.	2	2		2																					
2401	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test. She made a vowe to herself that is show determination to overcome. It @MONTH1 also make us want to read make and find out if she test her vowe and if she passed the test. For example it ends in �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again.	2	1		2																					
2404	4	he was saying that you should not give up and that you should keep trying like the plants in the spring time.	1	1		1																					
2405	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself.	1	1		1																					
2408	4	the author conclude this story like that to show a new beginning in the spring. Like how flowers bloom and bud in spring she will become a new better person. that why the author conclude the story like this.	1	1		1																					
2409	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will try the test again and get a fresh new start.  Also I think that its showing the reader if you fail something the first time don�t be afraid to go back and try it again. I also think that the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the test in the winter and doesn�t like what shes in. But in the spring when the hibiscus has buds on it shes going to have a fresh start on the test and the flower will have a new environment to survive in.	1	2		2																					
2411	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because that paragraph says when she is going to try to take the test and make changes in her changing life. For example she is sad in the story because she failed the test and want to go home. If she passes in the spring she might try to make changes and live here. This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2413	4	This last paragraph reveals something special to the reader. Saeng was given new hope winter mothers understanding and the hibiscus plant. She felt hopeless, miserable and incomparable upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland. When she came home, however, seeing the roots of the plant buried in the ground gave her new determination. The flower represents her. It adapted to be able to survive in cold weather, or hard times, in Saeng's case. The roots are her past and although they are buried, they are not forgotten. The actual flower represents a new life for Saeng in a new country .The author, Minfong Ho, gave personification or human�izing to non-living things to the story. This is why the author used the last paragraph then why she did.	3	2		3																					
2415	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" Saeng finds comfort in the plant after she failed her test. The plant reminds her of home and connects her with her past experiances. Even though she failed the test the first time she feels that if she studies and trys again she can pass. This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again. Saeng feels a connection with the plants rebirth and feels she can start over again to and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng vowes to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms."	2	2		2																					
2416	4	"The @CAPS1 why the authoR concludes the story saying, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRselF, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese REtuRn and this bibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The authoR ended it like that, because Saeng basically saying time will come FoR heR  to take that test and she will past it with belieF in heRselF,"	1	1		1																					
2419	4	In the last paragraph they trying to express what is coming. When winter is over spring will come which means the hibiscus will come back and it will be like home. Also the geese will return and because of that she will take the quiz again. To her it�s like starting all over and hopefully she will pass. Also she loves the hibiscus and seamce thats back maybe she will do so much beter. Overall a new time is coming.  	1	1		1																					
2422	4	Why the author concluds the story with ths paragraph because its telling the seasons and how they change and how they come and go and they start of with a new season then its something different. An I think thats why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus cause after spring is winter & when it was spring they have all the nice beautiful flower thats smell good. An when spring gone its winter so all the plants had died out they not going to be the same how they used to be.	1	1		1																					
2424	4	The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam	3	3		3																					
2425	4	The author concludes the sentence on the end to state when the plants start over growing and the geese come back, she will try again. For example, the plants have to grow their pedals back and the geese have to make their home and find food again. The author is saying she will take the test again when the geese come back and the plants grow again.	1	1		1																					
2426	4	The author wrote the paragraph because she went back in side the house to get a dinner and because ain�t going to see the garden until the other day and because the winter come and she will not play outside anymore until the winter goes. Like she said �In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. That quotation explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2428	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example �the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by�, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2429	4	The author ended the story with that specific quote because it shows the grasp in understanding the beauty & marvels of nature. Saeng spent a lot of money to buy a distinct flower called dok faeng-nol. Saeng was taking a driver's test a liscence but was failing it, and during her test she found that plant. Ashamed that she failed the test, she still showed her mother the flower she found, which was not like the one at home. Her mother is pleased with the flowers and understands that Saeng failed her test. Her mother said about the flower, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That what matters that was a figurative speech that there's hope for Saeng to pass her test again when she her learned more refined and is ready to try again. And with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring signifies a fresh new start at success.	2	3		3																					
2430	4	The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now.	0	0		0																					
2432	4	The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that.	2	2		2																					
2433	4	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem, it�s adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example,  in lines @NUM1 Saeng�s thought�s are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saeng�s eyes now and swept over her �and� in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept.� This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because it�s gone. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said  �and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.� It means that she will overcome all that and move on."	3	3		3																					
2439	4	It is all most sping like he said show melting and geese return and hibiscus is buding. Grass is growing tree are buding, @CAPS1 are singing	0	0		0																					
2443	4	The author concluded the story with this sentence because shes letting people know that she enjoys nature more than school.	0	0		0																					
2448	4	The author concludes this paragraph in the story because thats when she starts growing plants again & she wants to start over again	1	1		1																					
2450	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes. Saeng vowed silently to herself. That shows she calm down already, she feels better with her new country. She feels the snows meet, the geese return, she says that she will take that test again. It shows one that she doesn�t feel bad with the test more. She knows that she has opportunity to take it again and does it better. She has a different feeling with her problem. She looks her new country with a different eyes. All things with her become better. These are some reasons explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph.	2	1		2																					
2451	4	The author concludes the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show that she will try again with a new start. When she see�s the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus. The hibiscus brings back memories of her childhood. She then takes it home and shows the plant to her mother. Her mother replies with a �You what?� hearing her daughter tell her how much it is. With the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope. By saying she will start once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she means she will try again with a new and frash start.	2	1		2																					
2453	4	"The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because it appeared to be an important thought to ""Saeng"" and it was basically the main cause of everything rather the main subject of the story. She also @MONTH1 possibly have concluded the story with that particular paragraph because that was her last and final thought, or memory of her previous life / lifestyle before there present place of living."""	0	0		0																					
2454	4	The author concludes the story with �In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� because Saeng fails the test by spending her money on a big mac and not having enough for the type of flower her mother sent for. So since Saeng failed the test, she wants to take the test again and make her mother happy.	0	0		0																					
2455	4	 I believe that author ended the story with that sentence because it give a lifting feeling after the story was so sad. Saeng missed her homeland, was sad, used the flowers as relief, sad about her driving test and realy liked the plant. So the last sentence seemed to fit in as a confort zone to make the reader a bit more relieved. 	1	1		1																					
2456	4	The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time �when the shows me�. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, �Saeng  brokedown and wept!� The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the �show will melt� and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as �yet another old friend�. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage.	3	3		3																					
2458	4	After reading �Winter Hibiscus, I can tell that Saeng is a determined person, and likes nature. I can also tell that she is determined to pass the test. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the beginning of the story, Saeng fails her driving test. She walks home, and as she is walking, she comes across a familiar plant. This takes her to her childhood world. Have her not failed the test, she would have never walked home and come across the plant. The author didn�t want us to forget the reason she walked home. It would have never happened.	1	1		1																					
2459	4	The author concluds the story with this paragraph to show that next spring she will have anoter chane. The author shows that Saeng will relate to the blooms or the hybiscus plant and take the test again. The author does this to leave a clif haber and it shows there is more to Saeng�s life but it is still to come. In the story Saeng is trys to get used to change and that she is have a hard time. Her moter holes cheer her up but just like the winter comes. Saeng will Have next spring to take the divers test again.	1	2		2																					
2461	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows saeng being mature about it and being confident knowing she can take it again. When it says � saeng vowed silently to herself she thought about everything and the phrase is almost like she is going to start over.	1	1		1																					
2463	4	Saeng was happy when the snow was disappearing because she couldn�t wait for spring to come back to see the animals running around by her garden and seeing the beautiful geese flying in after they long & hard hibernation. So Saeng was excited to see everything grown back so she is guaranteed to pass the test this time	0	0		0																					
2464	4	 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time.	1	1		1																					
2466	4	"The author�s conclusion explains her feels. The authors conclusion saids to me ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test"" again"", what means is that she is a newoman. For example, taking the test means that she will change. Also what it means is that she ready to take on new thing. For instance, the test to her is getting ready to take on a new thing. Thats what I got from the conclusion. "	1	1		1																					
2468	4	"I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. This final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea. It tells us that in the spring when everything is coming to life Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in thelast paragraph show how Saeng and her mother have adapted and that new things are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text it says, �I know"", her mother said quietly. �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. It�s flower aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.� This means and represents that even though life is different here away from Saeng home they will adapt and survive in their own way."	2	2		2																					
2469	4	The author concludes the story the way she does because it shows that Saeng   needs to heal from the failing of the test before she can take it again. Saeng already knows that she  can heal. She realizes that she has gotten used to where she now lives, that things in her new land, like the sound of geese, are now �familiar to her�. The narrator of the story says, �..she  realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� almost familiar to her now.� Things in Saeng new home had been strange to her at first, but she had healed and gotten used to them. Saeng has also healed from leaving her original home of Vietnam. She was sad to leave her home, � A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.�, but she had healed. Saeng  remembers the flowers that she had known in vietnam as �old friends�, showing that it did not hurt her to remember them. When Saeng heals from failing   her driving test, like she had healed when moving  from Vietnam to the united states, she can re-visit the test, without pain.	3	3		3																					
2471	4	when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. That is in there for many reasons. One is because when winter comes and brings all the snow it kills her garden. So thats why she wants it to be spring again so she can start growing things agian in her garden. She got to take a test on the things that she is growing to make sure it is @CAPS1 for someone to eat it. Thats why I think the paragraph �when the come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	0	0		0																					
2475	4	"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus�. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says �In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again�. This shows Saeng�s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng�s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."	2	2		2																					
2477	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show her determination. When she says. ��when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Saeng is explaining how the geese have the determination to fly back and that the hibiscus has the determination to bud again so why shouldn�t she have the determination and confidence to take the test again. Saeng said, �I-I failed the test.� It seems as if failing the driving test made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country. But after she saw the geese�s and hibiscus�s determination through harsh conditions, she was determined to try the test again.	2	2		2																					
2484	4	The  last  paragraph of the story.� Winter Hibiscus by Minfong  Ho is important to the story. The last paragraph leaves a definite ending so the  reader  knows  exactly what is going to happen  in the future.  This  paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represent s symbols in the story. The author concludes the hibiscus is important to her. Along with the hibiscus it also shows that the  geese  and the melting of the snow represent a fresh  start  and a new  beginning . These symbols  are  important  to her in that they  give  her a chance to start over and she sees that in the  winter  hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2485	4	Saeng was very distrout knowing that she didn�t passed the test the test and to her she felt as though it was a let down or disappointment. This sentence shows the ambition and determination that Saeng has so that she will be able to pass this test.	1	1		1																					
2486	4	The author concludes the story with when they come back ��to show how saeng has changed throughout the plot of the story. In the beginning she refers to her new home as, �walking into another world.� As teenager she had to move from Vietnam where traditions are so much different than in the United States. However, there is one plant that is similar, the winter Hibiscus. The plant connects her previous life and home to the life and home she lives now. It was hard to adapt to the situation of moving, but the plant created familiar scents and the �familiar fragrance �which �filled her lungs .� It was even difficult for saeng to say the words �at home� without bursting into tears. Once the winter Hibiscus was in the ground it changed saeng and she realized that she needed to appreciate what she had. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it showed how much the plant resembled saeng and how her mind set on life was altered.  	3	2		3																					
2487	4	"I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says,�when the snows melt and the geese return� this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, �when this hibiscus is budding,""  and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam.  Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement.   "	3	2		3																					
2490	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 @NUM1. When the author write all those things in nature that will happen it symbolized re-birth and a fresh start, a new chance and that is what Saeng needs with her drivers license. The author put powerfully. Put those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a sense of roundness and end with that last paragraph, the story is complete.	2	1		2																					
2492	4	I believe the author of �winter Hibiscus �ends the story like she did because saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test.  Saeng states in the story �it�s the flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, thes winte hibiscus. That�s what matters.� I think saeng is using this as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam. She plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol. She will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring.	2	1		2																					
2493	4	"The author used ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because its resembling that her mother is refreshing, waking, and restoring its self. And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that happens. She was really sad she failed. �I � I failed the test� She seemed to be embarrassed + sad. So that last paragraph does a good job describing what Saeng is going to do. She is going to look on the bright side of things and restore her self to come back and pass the test"	2	2		2																					
2494	4	I the narrator this paragraph in the story because hibiscus is a valueable plant and garden is you own decision if you like to grow things like her mother grow hot pepper. Garden is a way to @CAPS1 different like the different types of foods you can plant and the different plants in the world there eg @CAPS2, lilis, and other other plants like that.	0	0		0																					
2495	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver�s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle.	1	1		1																					
2496	4	Why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because I think it�s showing how much it actually means to her and shows that she does actually care And by showing that she care's will take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2498	4	Saeng is not comftorable in her sorryndings, and has not addapted to the changes from where she moved. She finds the hibiscus and choses to go buy it, because it reminds of her home in @LOCATION2. When she brings it home  her mother seems shocked at first by the price saeng had paid, but is then more sympathetic when she realizes she misses @LOCATION2. Sheang says she is going to retake her test in the spring. She is also implying that she is going to change her attitude about living in @LOCATION1.	2	1		2																					
2502	4	I think That The author concludes the story with This paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there. By saying shell do the test again shows that she doesnt want to let ths defeat her in her new home and her new life.	2	1		2																					
2504	4	The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. � ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng.	1	2		2																					
2505	4	The author ends the story with  �When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. � A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eye now swept over her.� She wants to be able to handle the loss better. The author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over.      	2	2		2																					
2509	4	Saeng's peRsonality in this stoRy shows deteRmination and confident. I think she feels that she could do moRe experienced things on different plants. I also think this is a peRfect hobby experience foR someone who loves Plants. I feel that Saeng @MONTH1 have accomplished heR goals of planting. I think she @MONTH1 want to puRsue heR career in gaRdenning. When she stated that when the plants come back aRound, she would take the test again. I think she means that, she is willing to exploRe more plants. I think she @MONTH1 have got this experience of planting fRom heR motheR. To me this @MONTH1 have been a family tradition. Saeng will pRobably have kids and teach them about different types of floweRs.	1	1		1																					
2511	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph �Saeng vowed silently to herself� because she Saeng wants to do in proper time and season. �winter season�, the land or soil was so cold that plants was not able to grow properly. �Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars�, and she Saeng failed the test. �There was frail, wiry beauty to her Saeng mother that touched Saeng deeply�, she Saeng mother is shining when she worked to plants. These all are the description that concludes in the past which want to make correction and shine like her mother and also to pass the test.  	1	1		1																					
2514	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because to tell us that she will try and find that flower to bring back memories of her old home. To show us that they will be caming   back again it will survive even though its not from where she wanted it to be from. In the story it says,� I I failed the test,� meaning saeng had bought the hibiscus that wasn it real or what she thought was not what she wanted to be. In the last paragraph she says she will take that test again. Saying she will find winter hibiscus that is how it use to be in the homeland. She�s hoping they survive and hoping she finds a flower like it because in that last paragraph it says ,�saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again,� meaning she hopes and prays she will find one like her old homeland.      	0	0		0																					
2515	4	The Author was trying to end the story quick thats why he ended it with this one.	0	0		0																					
2516	4	When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn�t do good on the test the first time. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he don�t want people to think that she just worries about the plants.	1	1		1																					
2518	4	The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2519	4	This paragraph means when winter is over and the geese come back from the south, and she favorite plant comes back that used to be in her old country, she will try what she was trying to do before but this time she has more confidence. This is what I think this means.	1	1		1																					
2521	4	In the story � Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a well mannered carhoined. The author ended with that paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to persuade even though for away from home. She is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story she had failed a test and the hibiscus test her feeling nostalgic. When she got home her mother greeted her with kinds words kind of acting as an anti-depressent by making her food will not peppers and bitter melons. This kind of made Saeng see the good in life causing her not to give up and be confident that she will pass the test.	3	2		3																					
2522	4	"Well in the story, Saeng  fails her driving test. When she is walking home she sees a familar plant, she then goes to a flourist and finds out the plant is called a hibiscus. She then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother who she left behind so now she is connected to the plant. Also she sees geese fly over head heading south for the winter, so she says �When they come back,� so she means when the geese fly north for @DATE1. And when �the snow melts"" so when it becomes warmer and starts spring. When �this hibiscus is budding,� so when spring comes and the plant starts to bloom she will �take that test again"" so she says she will take the driving test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test . She vows to herself that come spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass."	2	2		2																					
2524	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author did this so that people who read the story will know what she is gonna do next spring and they might make out another storie in so that you will know that she will take the test in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2525	4	In the story winter hibiscus the author concludes the story with that paragraph because when the winter hits and the plant she likes will disappear and the flower gave her good luck so she said �when the snow melt in the spring and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The flower was very important to her. She said, �that rich, sweet scent that was familiar too. She was talking about the flowers smell compares to her grand mothers shell, it was the same.	2	1		2																					
2527	4	The author concludes the story with that because she want's to retake the test. Because she wants to pass the test for her mother. So she brought home the flower to apologize to her mother.	1	1		1																					
2529	4	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.	2	2		2																					
2532	4	This was a very interesting story and it snowed all the hardships this young girl has gone through, the author ended it in a very interesting way. When they ended the story I thought to myself how nice it ended. If think the author did a very nice job. She made it so that she snowed all the hard ships that Saeng had gone through, as if they were the harsh winter. Then as the author said, �as the snow melts away;��,I think this shows how even though Saeng  problems seem never ending and harsh, that one day they will be gone and things will become beautiful again, like the flower budding. In the spring time. Also she did a nice job because throughout the story I could feel her pain. I felt as if I was there with her because of her use of descriptive  words like, �exploding, shock ,intense� and others to describe how much of a sudden was everything was. Then when she ended it, it was like she was showing us Saeng�s hope for a better future, even though things aren�t the way they were back home!	2	3		3																					
2534	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home.	1	1		1																					
2535	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese because it shows how Saeng, like the geese, will adopt to her new environment. It shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do. She will take the test again and will not give up. The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, �� she noticed the tearstains on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes�[No]. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and that she does not like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, ��she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac�[Ho]. This proves how even though she @MONTH1 not like things at times, Saeng is willing to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, ��she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now �[@NUM1].Saeng is getting more and more used to her surrounding and is adopting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese.	3	3		3																					
2539	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to take responsibility for her school work now. For example in the story she made it obvious she cared more about the garden then school.	0	0		0																					
2540	4	Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said �yes| when she planted the hibiscus.	0	0		0																					
2545	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again. The author wants to tell the reader because she fail the test she know what she did wrong and shes going to correct. For example when Saeng said, �then I will take that test again.� Saeng feel sorry she fail a simple test so she wants to retake the test when the snow melts.	1	1		1																					
2546	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant wasent budding and the geese are going away and then see failed the test because all that made her sad. But when the snow melts, the geese return and the plant starts budding she will be happy again and she will take the test agian and she will pass because she is happy.	1	1		1																					
2548	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they wanted to show that she is comited to her nature especially to The hibiscus. She thought that the hibiscus was special because of what she did with it. Like when they said �she reached out and touched petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velet toward the centre�. And that�s why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.  	1	1		1																					
2554	4	I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens	1	1		1																					
2558	4	The author includes  this sentence in  the paragraph  because  it�s  the  start  of  a  new  beginning.	1	1		1																					
2559	4	In the story the author concludes with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think she did that to say that you shouldn�t give up. In the story Saeng goes to the store and �touched a petal.� She buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home. In this way it seems Saeng is willing to give up her memories of her past. When she brings home the plant and her mom and her plant it in the garden. I think Saeng is trying to make her new home like her old.	2	2		2																					
2562	4	The reason why I belive the author concluded the story like that, is because, she is going going to aways start over. For instants in the story she said I�I failed the test. From that known she throught she was going to give up. So that is why I belive he ended the story with that line	1	1		1																					
2564	4	She means that when she return she is going to do the same thing again and see if she will do better or not.	0	0		0																					
2565	4	"Saeng vowed siletly to herself ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because her mind went of the track from think about a flower. She says "" One of the blossoms had fallen off"" then carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. it happ distracted her mind. Her promisreaction from tailing was silentess for a long moment and didn't say nothing. Her never got mad. All she did was brushing the fragments of green off Saeng's hands. Her mother was mainly thinking about the plants as the day went, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus"" into it. Seeing her mother caused a reaction of ideas, so trying to etch a image of geese. She sent a goat to retake the driving test again as she was getting use to her new. The intro says ""Saeng, a teenage girl and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. it never mentioned about her family"""	1	1		1																					
2566	4	The author included this paragraph to show how much the girl missed Vietnam. When the girl saw the hibiscus it brought back memories of Vietnam. Seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort. So the paragraph is there to show how the United States is different from Vietnam. Since the United States has changing seasons it allows the girl to get use to the United States. The plant will always be there, but she has to look for the good that United States provides. The author states, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This quote shows how the girl was getting use to the United States. How she will always remember Vietnam, and finds things in the United States that remind her of Vietnam. In conclusion, the paragraph is used to show how much the girl missed Vietnam, but how she finds comfort within the United States.	1	2		2																					
2568	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One being that she is still uncomfor table about talking about her old home ��She was still to make to say the words at home�� [HO] so the snow melting the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. Second remind her of her home. We know this because Saeng   says �� Just as she known it would feel� �� Back home it Just grow wild just at from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs�� [HO].So with reminder of her home she is give both comfort and confidence. The author therefore concluded with this paragraph because since the geese, hibiscus, and the snow melting remind her of her home, that is when she will take the test again, w hen she is confident and strong.   	2	1		2																					
2569	4	By adding this paragraph to the end of the story, it show that a resolution was made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heartbroken however, after buying the hibiscus, she had found hope and motivation and decides, in the end, that she will take the test again, �in the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. Its to help move the story to a conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this. Readers are able to abtein the message as the story from paragraphs like this. In this case, the author�s message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things. It is important to know what a author is trying to tell the reader through paragraphs as not only a reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express their ideas clearly to an audience.	2	2		2																					
2570	4	I think that the author uses this quote, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.� @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. �But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?� �BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.� @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable. 	3	3		3																					
2571	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. In the sping time the hibiscus grows just like Saeng. When Saeng got to the new place she was small and peuney just like the plant. �Its leaves quavering in the wind"" (@NUM1). This quote tells us the the plant was weak a peuney. If the plant was strong it would not be quivering. The fact that Saeng brokedown and bought the plant tells us she was not strong. And at the end the author uses that paragraph to tell the reader that the hibiscus is strong and so is Saeng and the can over come anything."	2	2		2																					
2572	4	The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says �Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, �� and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. 	2	2		2																					
2575	4	"The Author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope and the meaning of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story like that because spring is a time for new beginings and where everything comes back to life and starts to regrow so to say that when the snow melts and geese return. ""Its. saying its the right time for a secnd chance. I.t failed the test Saeng said.....She tore off a leaf shruddy it to pests�. that shows the dying of the hope she had or the hybisus symbolized it. So that�s why the author ended it like that b/c it shows new heqionqrys."	2	1		2																					
2578	4	In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story �Winter Hibiscus�. In the story the young girl finishes of by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says �Saeng vowed silently to herself� but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last �vowe� is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girls determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says �and this hibiscus is budding� its showing the girls connection with the plant because of the comfort and canfidence it given her, ecpecially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl was with her the flower and the homeland.	2	2		2																					
2583	4	The auther concluded the story with this because just like the flower it will come back a new, and so will she. The flower represents determination, using the flower to show her own determination. Even though she failed her drivers test she still has determination to take it, and try to pass again. Even with failur she is determained to get over it. Just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back. Saeng is frogeting her failure and coming back a new.	2	2		2																					
2584	4	"The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of realization, and new beginnig for Saeng. She spent so much time missing the past, that she didn�t know how to enjoy the present, which theme-wise the author is saying �live in the moment�. The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said,""It's strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that�s what matters. the author is say ultimately that tough times are irevitable, so hold on to the moments that make you smile, for they will help you perservere through the times that are tough."	3	2		3																					
2586	4	The author puts that excerpt into the text to show the reader that she had made a mistake an will fix it in the future. I believe the other put it in  for that reason because in the text Saeng began to cry when she admitted to her mother that she failed the test. This shows that she was really upset by the fact she failed an hopes to improve in the near future. Another reason why I believe �the author concludes the story like this is to lead the reader on to believe Saeng is going to get over beign home sick.	1	1		1																					
2587	4	The author ends the story �Winter Hibiscus� with the passage �When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time. I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her home land so she thought when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. The plant made her think positivly. And insted of thinking she will fail she is thinking she will pass the next time. I also think Saeng felt comforting her when she was upset and I think that helped her feel alot better.	2	2		2																					
2588	4	The author concludes this story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver�s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, �That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?� Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,��in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   	3	3		3																					
2595	4	She failed the test at the same day that she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her. The plant represents her home, where she used to live and the geese could represent how they are moving on in life, over coming the obstacles of cold weather, and snow to move on to something better most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her. So she wanted to take it again, around the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels thot since she failed, she should start over.	2	2		2																					
2597	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting.	0	0		0																					
2603	4	The author ends it with that paragraph because the girl is talking about when the @DATE1 or spring comes again she will try again. The author ends it with that because it explains how the girl feels about spring and the animals. The girl says allot about the geese in the story, so we know from that she likes animals.	1	1		1																					
2604	4	Then author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sums up how the memories and the plant effects her. Just like the plant Saeng grows better in her own country and likes it better there but she can still survive in a new place if it is taken care of and fights to stay beautiful. The ending shows that Saeng realizes that if she trys harder she can survive like the plant, so she is going to take the test agian. Her mother say, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.� Her mother is trying to tell the daughter its ok and she get through the hard times. In the end Saeng knows she can.	2	3		3																					
2607	4	I know the reason why the author concludes the story the way he dose and  it is a good reason . It says that since she failed this year next year when it is time to ready up the garden she will tell again . That is a good moral because you have to keep trying and trying to succeed   because even if you fail you are not losing any  progress. It is like what @PERSON1 had happen to him even though it took him @DATE1 tries to successfully  make the light bulb he simply said � I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb . So I do agree with this author and how he ended the story.  	1	1		1																					
2608	4	She does this to show her strugle with her gardeding struggle. It is like this because ech year she has to work on her garden because the winter blowes it away meaning it kills it.	0	0		0																					
2611	4	In the story the test was if she could overcome her homesickness. When she want to the greenhouse all of the. plants and flower brought back memories of her homeland. When she saw the flower it reminded her of the times life she would get water from the well and and a flower was floating in it. So after the winter she would go back to the place and see if she was still homesick. I feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again  	3	3		3																					
2613	4	I think the author concluded the Story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First, when saeng first saw the hibiscus, she was sad, but after seeing the flower, she got happy. Next, her mother helps her plant it and saeng is sure it'll be there in spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since she has reflected on her past	1	1		1																					
2614	4	I think Minfong Ho concluded her story �Winter Hibiscus� the way she did to show the avid determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test. Now that she had a moments of her homeland and her family there she was most likely reminded that they would�ve wanted her to succeed, and so she promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This is why I feel that �Winter Hibiscus� was concluded in this way.	2	2		2																					
2615	4	At the end of the essay �Winter Hibiscus� by @CAPS1 Ho, it ends in a positive manner. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason why I think that the author decided to put that there, was to show how Saeng felt about her country. So when the country that she is has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring. Which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test. Thats why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay.	2	1		2																					
2618	4	The author concludes the story of the end because I think the author concludes the end of the story because he wants to kind of say I will be ready next year to sprout again he will be ready to test him to not cry and break down when he sees the plant to think of childhood memories he will be ready o	1	1		1																					
2619	4	"Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden and to remind her of her homeland. She has failed some sort of test and is upset over it. Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn�t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus Saeng says to herself, �.In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says �hibiscus is budding�, and �the geese return�, It must be a test that you can only take once a year. because she says that �In the spring"" she will take the test again."	1	1		1																					
2620	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver�s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. 	2	2		2																					
2621	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself �I will take that test again,� shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng�s good character. It shows Saeng�s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	1	2		2																					
2622	4	"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost farmiliar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a ""cheerful"" way to end it."	2	2		2																					
2624	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter the hibiscuses are dying. Also she is leaving and wont come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, and she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2627	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows how sometimes you have to wait till the time right for you to try again... For example, In the book it says �Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, �How strang to see it in apat,� Back home it just grew wild jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs.� This shows that anything can be done when the time is right.	1	2		2																					
2628	4	Emotions,symbolizim, to it realized � all are reasons the author concluded the story that way. a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you, with mixed emotions. Emotions like sadness, hope, and wounder. The author makes the reader feel sad with the girl failing her test and missing home. The author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered. the author uses symbolizes in the concluding, sentances by giving the plant and the geese a sense of impotance in the story and the plant has to do with the home that she really misses. In the final story the author leaves a lot of peceptions on several. Like the importance of the plant and why did they move from a place that they lavd so much. That is why I think the author ended the story that way.	2	1		2																					
2632	4	The author concludes  the story  with  that paragraph  for many reasons. One reason is that the author is trying to say that she is going to overcome  the obstacle  (the test)  no matter what. In the text is say �it can make through  the  cold months. � @CAPS1 consumer her which supports the last paragraph also, she is in a new country and is starting a new beginning. In the text it says �Not like the same kind we had before.�This implies that it different in this country and she will soon adjust. Finally it says, �this hibiscus is budding� which means she will bloom.	2	2		2																					
2633	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.	1	1		1																					
2634	4	The author ends the story likes this so readers can understant the theme. Which is, you can always start over, after a mistake is made. For example saeng failed herb driving test and then it took a toll on her she will try again in the spring. I guess she figures that once she once she has renewed  herself she'll do better.	1	1		1																					
2638	4	Several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life. Also when the hibiscus starts budding she will feel conforted, as though it auomaticaly brings back her childhood memories. It also is a link to her past home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again. Its as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, she will also be ready.     	2	2		2																					
2639	4	The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower. It�s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus.	1	1		1																					
2642	4	"In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng makes a vow to herself. �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� this vow means that she will start fresh, make changes, and adapt to her new life. She want disappoint her mother and she wont be broken down by her memories. She concluded the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now."	2	1		2																					
2648	4	The author coNcludes the story with this paragraph because she was tryiNg to say siNce the hibiscus is plaNted we are goiNg to see how it does with the winter. ANd wheN spriNg arrives and it's still staNdiNg she caN go take the test. I thiNk the author was compariNg the hibiscus to their life aNd obstacles they will go through, so if the hibiscus is still staNdiNg theN that meaNs everythiNg will be fiNe to where she caN go back aNd take the test.	1	2		2																					
2649	4	The last paragraph of �Winter Hibiscus� describes determination and the growth of a person. Saeng says that when �this hibiscus is budding,  then I will take that test again.� Just as the hibiscus blooms Saeng will bloom forth and strive through the winter to try and succeed in passing her test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she can�t be sad forever. She must be determined in order to pass the test. The next season will be a sort of renewal, starting fresh and coming out beautiful as does a hibiscus in bloom.	2	2		2																					
2650	4	"The Author of �Winter Hibiscus�, Minfong Ho, concluded hes story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will take her drivers test again, because she wanted to end on a happy note. In the begining of the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2, failed her drivers test. She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. �I mean it�s not like the kind we had at � at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� (Ho, @NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else."	2	2		2																					
2651	4	"The author concludes the story with these paragraph for a very good reason. In away she just letting it go and will wait to take it again. I think that is a good that she found the flower. That is because it let her and her mother and in away make her better. For example when it say's"" the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."	1	1		1																					
2652	4	The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. It show a small amount of newfound confidence Saeng now has. This ending also shows how much of an effect the �Winter hibiscus� had on her. with bringing back memories of her old country. If Saeng wouldn�t have found the hibiscus, she would have never started to reminisce about her old home. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her past, but it also helped her compare her new home to her old home. Through this she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so bad, and that she still has a little bit of her old home with her everyday. This realization gave her just enough hope and confidence to want to try the driving test again This ending shows the change of heart Saeng feels for @LOCATION1 and her small gain of hope and confidence.  	3	2		3																					
2655	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says �In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again�. She is saying that she wants to start over. and adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again. because she says �when the snow melts and the geese return.� She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way.	2	1		2																					
2656	4	I think the author concludes the story like that because its showing the time that will be passing. When it shows time passing, she�s grew up more and maybe she�ll be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is. Also because the hibiscus will be budding, that will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed because it all make her feel more like secure home feeling. �hibiscus is budding� this way the flower will be starting new and so will she.	2	1		2																					
2658	4	The author concludes this story with �when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng didnt past her test and knew her mom would be mad so that why she got the flower. If she wouldn�t have failed her test she probably wouldn�t have got the flower in the first place.	1	1		1																					
2659	4	The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a vowe to herself because it shows how important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her determination because it reminds her of home. Saeng says �� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The hibiscus flower gives her confidence. It reminds her of her home in Vietnam before they moved to @LOCATION2. Therefore, the author concludes the story with that certain paragraph because it symbolizes the importance of the flower.	2	1		2																					
2660	4	She feels very connected  to this hibiscus plant because it renind her of her homeland.I think she is trying to say when the hibiscus plant shows it�s inner budding she will to. The plant has to try hard to produce flowers, and the seen has to care out to melt the snow, so that means when it comes around to it  she needs to comes out and melt all of her had habits and get what she meads to do to pass the test. But still not forgetting where she came from and all the memory left bedide. ��vowed silently to herself �then I will take that test again.��       	2	2		2																					
2662	4	There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home. This is shown when she says �a blossom of two would have blown into the well� It reminds her of her homeland. It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she said�she realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.� This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing.	2	2		2																					
2663	4	The author is saying that she will be ready soon enuff when the flowers begin to grow and the geese begin to come home, she will be ready	1	1		1																					
2665	4	In �@CAPS1 Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to make a point. She needs all of those thing to happen for her to be sound enough to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2667	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 reason why he does is because he wants to conclude by writing about geese. Second he like plants and the season�s that they bud. He vowed that he would take that test in the spring. He cant wait until the snow melts so that way he can take the test.	1	1		1																					
2669	4	The author�s choice of words in the conclusion of the story, I believe sent of let the reade knew that the story continues. But, I think that the test is that to remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
2671	4	I think Saeng concluded with this story because there is always time to make up for the past if the past allows you to meaning that @CAPS1 didn�t past the test. I fell she met that �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to me this means that even though it is snowing outside there is always next spring to start growing back up the vegetable garden this also relates to Saeng even though she failed the test there is always another change we can make up for that lost and retry and try to succeed at this one.	1	1		1																					
2673	4	The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Like the geese are coming back she is positive that she can take the test again. She knows that she will pass the test. In the story she said �Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet reptition of season upon season, almost familiar to hernow� This means that when she had just moved here she thought that everything was strange because, she have not seen anything like this before. Now as she is living here to would get use to it because, she knows what will happen nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now	1	2		2																					
2675	4	The author concludes the story with that story because she loves her homeland and love�s nather and loves her mother. She loves the greeness and cant wait in tell spring comes. so she will take the test of being out of place to herself, that is why she concluds the story that way. 	1	1		1																					
2682	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�by Minfong Ho,the author  decided  to  end  it  with  the  sentence   �when they come back, Saeng  vowed  silently  to herself,  in   the  spring. When  the snows  melt and the geese  return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because  it show that even though the main character Saeng, @MONTH1 a failed once, she will trying again too. The  geese  will  be coming back to try out a  new  spring  and  the  hibiscus  will be budding new flowers so its like its starting over again as well and Saeng  says  that  if  both  have  made it once they tried again then   she can as well but this time she will succeed. Also, it shows the  determination  all  living  things  have  to  succeed at their main purpose. .The  flower  drivers  to re-bud. The  geese  drive  at  coming back  again  during  the  spring and the main character  drives  at  passing  the  test.The author of �Winter Hibiscus,�Minfong Ho,put that quote as the last  line of  the  story  for  inspiration.To  inspire  people  to  continue  the  path of life and if  you fail are task,try again.So the author gives you inspiration to help you continue to live your life	3	3		3																					
2684	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she�ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she�ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn�t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  	1	1		1																					
2685	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new life style. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change.	2	2		2																					
2686	4	The author includes this  because he�s using metaphors to explain how the author felt about Saeng�s personal life is	0	0		0																					
2689	4	The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory�s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject.	1	2		2																					
2690	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with a sentence about retaking the drivers test in the spring, to express the themes of adopting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower �Madagascar penwinhle� she thinks �how strange to see it in a pot� because �Back home it just grows wild,� The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says �and the geese return,� because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says �I will take that test again.� This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver�s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that �the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she �Dug out a hole� and knows it�s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng�s character.  	3	3		3																					
2691	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph to set the sonip theme. In the story, the @CAPS1 represents very important thing to saeng � confidence, beauty, adaptation� some things she can apply to herself, & her memories of her old homeland. She had failed the driving test. Afterwards, she bought the @CAPS1 to comfort her homesickness. I saw the @CAPS1 as a sort of metaphor to Saeng the same @CAPS1, but growing differently in a different area just as she is still the same but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the @CAPS1 budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland by the @CAPS1 blossoming ,it can represent her love for the homeland. When the author wrote �then I will take that test again� it is referring to the new confidence she @MONTH1 have later when the @CAPS1 blooms (another @CAPS1 /person metaphor)	3	3		3																					
2697	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because during winter everything dies down till springs where everything is lively again, the Saeng would feel more motivated to do well on the test. Saeng is sort of like the plant, strives and worries in the winter and then blooms beautifully in the spring.  Also, I think the memories that the winter hibiscus plant brought her; motivated  her to stop staying in the past and move on towards the future.	2	1		2																					
2698	4	He  wrote this  because  he is talking  about weather changes	0	0		0																					
2701	4	She says this because right now it is winter and flowers can grow in the winter due to how cold it is. So she is saying when spring is back she will take the test of growing the flowers again. In conclusion, this is why the author states that conclusion at the end of the paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2703	4	The author conclude this saying it to the story because he thought it would go because at valkay about how the hibisuse a yet budding in the winter & and how all at the geese will return to the home and stay there because they hate the winter.  	1	1		1																					
2707	4	"THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY INTENDED TO SHOW THE HOPEFUL ENLIGHTENMENT OF SAENG'S COMPLEX DILEMMA. IN THE PHRASE, ""WHEN THEY COME BACK"" THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY REFERS TO THE HIBISCUS FLOWERS THAT REPRESENT THE FOND MEMORIES OF HER HOMELAND. THE AUTHOR ILLUSTRATES SAENG'S STRUGGLE ADAPTING TO HER NEW LIFE THROUGH A �TEST� OF PLANTING THE BUDS JUST AS SHE HAD DONE BACK HOME WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. THIS TEST REPRESENTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ADAPTATION TO HER NEW LIFE. FOR THAT REASON, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED HER STORY WITH THE PARAGRAPH INDICATING SAENG WILL INDEED TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN."	1	2		2																					
2709	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Maybe to show confidence that she would do everything over again if she had to. For example ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", so basically she's saying she's willing to take that step, that chance . The author ended the story with this confidence and couragement.."	1	1		1																					
2710	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.� She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself so she made a vowe to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her.	1	1		1																					
2711	4	The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience.	1	1		1																					
2713	4	The author decides to end the story with the paragraph to show many things. First of all, the author uses the ending paragraph to show optimism. The whole story had been sad but the ending shows some hope. In the beginning it says, � @CAPS1  of loss so deep� �(@NUM1) and at the end it says, � I will take that test again.� (@NUM2) shows how her  attitude   changes from cynical to hopeful. Another reason why the story is ended with that paragraph is to show how Saeng was accepting. When the story says that the geese were  , � almost familiar to her now.�(@NUM2) demonstrates that even though Saeng is sad to leave her home, she is adapting quite well. Therefore, the author ends the story with an inspiring paragraph to show change for the better.	2	2		2																					
2714	4	"The author is concluding the story with that parapraph stating when spring and @DATE2 comes again then she will take the test again. Meaning she will plant the flowers and get them to grow again. Hoping she don�t fail at doing so. For example, ""Mrs. Lambert, liked it. this sharp bitter melon that left a golden after taste on the tongue.�"	1	0		1																					
2715	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to end it on a good note and send a good message there not going to quit because they failed the first time.	1	1		1																					
2716	4	I say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy. She was still going to take it again, she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day from failing her driver�s test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower so she went to a florist to see if she can buy it. When she does purchase it she goes home and gives it to her mom and they plant it. So maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck I think.	1	2		2																					
2717	4	The author concludes the story wt this passage because its symbolic. When the Geese come back in the spring it will be like a now beginning. When the Hibiscus is budding it has a new life. When all this happens Saeng will have a new fresh start too. Leaving the story to end like this is a cliff-hanger for some. It makes you wanting more, knowing she failed her test you want to know if Saeng will pass it in the spring, @CAPS1 a fresh new start. Everything and everyone will have new starts when the beginning of the new season comes around when the hibiscus blooms it will be like she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, new connections w/her past and comfort during hard times. The Hibiscus symbolizes all this	3	2		3																					
2719	4	The author ends the story this way because by the time winter ends she will have adapted to her new society, just like the hibiscus.	1	1		1																					
2720	4	"The young girl Saeng from the story ""Winter Hibiscus� by minfong Ho, has moved from her home land of Vietnam to the United States. The young girl was hoping to get her drivers license but failed, The hibiscus she sees comforts her reminding her of Vietnam. When she purchases it her mother is concern of the price but sees how home sick her daughter is and becomes understanding. After planting the Hibiscus She watches the geese and understands that every year they change their habitat. The geese inspire Saeng along with the Hibiscus and promises herself that"" in the spring when the snow melts away the geese return and thes Hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."	2	2		2																					
2722	4	The author: minfong Ho, finishes the story like this to show the overcoming of obstacles. The story shows the many difficulties saeng faces when leaving her old home and comming to her new one. In the day described. She failes a drivers test, doesn�t eat lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old home. Also, this paragraph shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes her. The plant is not in its native home, faces many difficulties; the cold its small pot, and even its general surrounding. In every way, the plant is in the same circumstances as main character and the last paragraph is used to link them.   	3	2		3																					
2723	4	The reason why the author used this paragraph is because he was sag that the snow go away in spring time that all.	0	0		0																					
2729	4	The author concludes this story because it shows her determination. It says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home. It also says that as the buds grow so will she. But her more mentally then physically. And her taking the test again is meaning that she has faith in herself that she will mature and grow up to be a person who misses their home land but accepts the new home that they live in. That is why the author ended this way.	2	2		2																					
2730	4	She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quiter and she going to try harder. 	1	1		1																					
2731	4	Reserved need to check keenly	3	3		3																					
2732	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the cold was brufield or the  author never  wanted to be around while the cold was in sesion. At the  time it was realy cold	0	0		0																					
2738	4	I belive the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed that it doesn�t mean her lifes over. She will requperate and to the same thing next year.	1	1		1																					
2740	4	Maybe the author wrote that as the last sentence or paragraph because in the story she did something and failed at it, so she wants to do it again.	1	1		1																					
2741	4	The Author of �Winter Hibiscus� ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant �dies� in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle.	2	2		2																					
2742	4	"After reading the quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test. From the story ""winter' Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I think the author is trying to say that after the winter and fall pass she will be upto the challenge to plant again and feel good about herself. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive ""V"" was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. Reflecting back I feel Saeng felt that the geese was secretly letting her know what she was doing was right."	1	1		1																					
2746	4	The Author includes that part in his story because it�s talking about na ture and a the beuttifl thing's in natural. Ther�s the @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, tall green grass the white @CAPS3 fence and in the story there are those sanne type's of things that been in nature.	0	0		0																					
2749	4	She was upset with herself because she bought the hibicus and not the plant seeds. So she starts crying because she remembered how pretty their old one used to be. When the snow melts and the flowers start to bloom is when she is going to take the test again. The author ended the paragraph like that to show a new begining next year.	1	1		1																					
2750	4	I believe that she included this because she wanted to show important it was to her. For example when she says in the spring she will take the test again. I think that ment she will work harder to make sure she does everything right. So that she can say she follows through on things that are important to her. These are my thoughts on why she included this paragraph in the story.	1	1		1																					
2751	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because 1. Saeng failed the test. @NUM1. It takes time for a hibiscus to bud. @NUM2. It sound like a good end i not and plus she would not want to take the test in the snow.	1	1		1																					
2752	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know that how Saeng @CAPS1 about the hibiscus. I thinks the author concludes this because he his telling the reader that the hibiscus gives saeng goodluck and with this good luck She will past the test. In the story it tells us how much saeng adores the plant For example when she got to the hibiscus She reached out and toched a petal gently. It Felt smooth and cool. Thats why the author use thal paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng @CAPS1 and how it make her  feel confident.	1	1		1																					
2754	4	By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story �winter Hibiscus,� the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of seang at her struggle to live in another country & her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating statement on the test saying � I will take that test again,� the author gives us that understanding that Saeng has not given up & lets the reader know she will stand & live strong.	2	2		2																					
2755	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is becaus now she has something to work for. The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph becaus she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could wait to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are reasons why i think the author put that conclude with the paragraph.	1	2		2																					
2756	4	The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simpley set a time for her to try again. Saeng wants to make it in this world and wants to have a good life, so she tries new things	1	1		1																					
2757	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers. The reason why the author chose to write the last paragraph like that is because it finishes the story right. That ending when the goes man away and the flowers start to grow she will try to fit in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2758	4	I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because it�s  meaning fail odvestily Saeng  really like garden and it�s  something  special to her . Also when all the snow  melts  she  will  take  the test  and  hopfully get her drivers  licesies.	1	1		1																					
2760	4	I believe the author chooses to end the story wit this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represent her home. But she realizes  by the sight of the geese, flying sooth that evenyone has to leave home at some point. She has now come to terms with what is happening and she will try again for her drivers liscence soon. When the hibiscus buds again it will by symbolic to her and that is when she will be ready to try once again.	1	2		2																					
2763	4	She said that she was going to take the test agen because to show her mom that she can do it and Past it this time. instad of worring over her old home.	1	1		1																					
2764	4	I think that this snows hope because she had really missed her homeland and kind of found peace and serenity by being around them she says �That at least she could hold on to� meaning the bud I think that she was very upset because of missing home she missed having her grandmother wash her hair and put a dok mallk into it. I think that since she really had nothing else but the flowers that reminded of her homeland the text said �where was the fine toothed come the hibiscus hedge, the well. her gentle grandmother she was missing all these thing so I think that by putting her in this posistion it has brought her to a place of where she not only misses the people from her homeland but the beautiful things as well and how she always has kind of a part of home with her because of the flower.	2	2		2																					
2766	4	The author concludes the story like this because it show that she is determined to do pass the test. It is also like if the birds can fly south she can pass that test.	1	1		1																					
2767	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author does this for several reasons. The author wants to show you that Saeng still has hope and that she believes she can make it right. Also, to show Saeng will still try and adapt to her surrounding and make friends. Saeng is also, determined that she will pass the test next time she takes it. Last it is emphazing the conflict and how Saeng overcame it.	2	1		2																					
2771	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to end on a happy yet motivating note. In the story Saeng says that she failed the test and was very dissapointed with herself. The test must have of been very important to her for her to be so dissapointed. The author also probably ended with this paragraph to show that Saeng is devoted in passing this test. Saeng seems like a sentemental yet reliable person. I believe that the test is to spend a minimal amount of money and she wants to earn respect from her mom. That is why taking and passing the test seems so important to Saeng. That is why the author ended with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2772	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author concludes the story with the lines �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason that the author concludes the test with these lines is because she is re-establing the symbolism of the plant. In the text it said that the plant budds in the spring, once it has time to grow and adapt to the new enviroment. Just as the plant needed that time so did the main character Saeng. She just moved from Vietnam and failed her drivers test. Saeng is very unsure of her new culture. For example she likes bitter melon it says. �But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself much prefered it to a Big Mac.� She appears to think she is misunderstood an no one likes her, but just as the plant will adapt to this new life so will she.	3	3		3																					
2774	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng whole world is the plants a since they are gone there is no motivation.	0	0		0																					
2775	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author�s reasoning for saying this is because the presence of memories from Saeng�s homeland comforts her. So much that they she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous. �it was like walking into another world,� said Saeng, when she entered the florist shop, after failing her drivers test. It was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was only thinking about the plants, flowers. The flowers take her to a happy peace and make her feel at home. Like everything is going to be alright. This is  why the author concludes with such a sentence because us as readers should show memories of her farmland will help her pass her drivers test.  	2	3		3																					
2777	4	I really do not know why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Possibly because she started to talk.	0	0		0																					
2780	4	The author concludes  with this paragraph, to give a sense at hope and growth. The flower represents Saeng�s  homelard, and it makes her feel comforted. It connects her with her emotions and reminds her of the way are. The growth and flourishing of the hibiscus corresponds to the flourish of Saeng. When it blooms, she will have a true piece of home with her, and  will be able to take the test again. The story  is  about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change. The visual, and nearly lyrical expression of the blooming hibiscus makes the reward and result of your struggles �seem so much more beautiful	2	3		3																					
2781	4	The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The begining was very negative with Saeng failing her drive�s test and her mother yelling at her. But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will peservere wheras before she was so upset, @CAPS1 when she said, �I-I failed the test.� Then for Saeng to refound from this event, gave the reader hope and thats why the author did this.	2	1		2																					
2782	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is talking about how there will be a new start. Since Saeng failed the test and in the winter the plant will die in the spring the plant will bud again and she will retake the test. Its a new chance to start things over.	1	1		1																					
2785	4	The author conclud the story with that because as winter come every thing goes away. Like the trees lose the leaves the geese fly south and the flower die off. So this passage is saying in the spring time when every thing comes back she will start the test again. it is like to start a new life back over.	1	1		1																					
2786	4	"In the story called ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes the story with this paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, than I will take that test again."" The reason why the author had put that at the end of the story was because when things go under ground everyone wants to wait and wait until it comes back up again because when you fail everything goes down but if you wait awhile than everything will start to raise Just like flowers and everything else that you can think of. So that is why the author put that at the end of the story cause to tell people that it is ok for people to fail Just as long as you get up and try again until you reach your goal. So that is what the author was talking about and thats why Minfong Ho put that at the end of the story so that people can read and learn for what it says."	1	2		2																					
2788	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her and when it is budding she feels stronger. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say �at home.� When she says �and this hibiscus is budding,� I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a �V� so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again.	3	3		3																					
2791	4	she said it because she didn�t do what she was sopose to so she said she failed her mother was mad for a second but then stopped she said I love it and asked if she wanted something to eat so the went inside but she took the task as a test so she said next time I will do it right.	1	1		1																					
2792	4	I believe the author ended the story with the �test� because it is a big part of Saeng�s life or part of her tradition.	1	1		1																					
2793	4	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up.	1	2		2																					
2798	4	The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and strgging to survive and fit in in it�s non-natve land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported through out the story when her mother connents on the hibiscus by the late. She says, �It�s strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matter� (Ho @NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saeng�s life. Both must be strong fight through hard imes where no, one, �not even her class mates or frends, or Mrs. Lambert� (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, shes promising herself she will fight through the hard times grow strong, just as her winter hibiscus.	3	3		3																					
2800	4	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn�t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn�t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task	1	2		2																					
2801	4	The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way.	2	2		2																					
2803	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the hibiscus flower will be adaptating to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has began to grow older and much wiser of things allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now of where she is living just how the hibiscus flower adapts to it's place with ease and gets use to seasons.	2	3		3																					
2805	4	"Because the Winter hibiscus"" was in the ground how and Saeng tomped down the soil around it. overhead, a flock of canada greese flow by, their faint honks clear and -Yes- @CAPS1 to Saeng now. "	0	0		0																					
2806	4	"The author includes this paragraph in the story because it shows a impression on work ethic and adaption to a new environment can be difficult. �not even @PERSON1, looked it."" makes something to dislike apparent to a student that is new don�t give them good. work ethic and that will essue them mentally also. Therefore the girl is not comfortable and not enthused To  working on something that none woud appreciate."	1	1		1																					
2807	4	The author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. For example, She writes �she vowed silently to herself.� When you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something. Everything else that she says after that she really means it. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal.	1	1		1																					
2809	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to let us know when she�l take it again. When the season change is when she will take it again. Saeng is probably embrassed that why she wants to wait so long. Saeng took a long walk home and stoped at the flower shop. She tried getting her mind off failing the test. Saeng brought a nice flower/plant for @MONEY1. Her mother was upset at first, then realize her daughter wasn�t happy and changed her mood.	1	1		1																					
2810	4	I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.  	1	2		2																					
2812	4	Saeng  would  silently in spring she will take the that again in the good ending to this story it was as goods ended  because the story had listed   come  of  malance  ready and spring it and of the plant beautiful  time the spring the all as plant ending because spring in a near trying and for the take the test again of that time , to think it�s a goods ending because the ruler strong are  about   machines saeng and spring it  and  makes  is near paragraph . That is why its is a good ending plant to the stays.   	1	1		1																					
2813	4	The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver�s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on.	2	2		2																					
2814	4	"I believe the author concluded the story with �When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� because it shows the entire theme of the story. The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrats this when she says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example �The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair."" The hibiscus was something from home that gave her good memorys. The hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better. "	2	2		2																					
2816	4	The author concludes the story with this saying because it will be a fresh start and it will be spring and beautiful. �@CAPS1 plant  it right now� is telling me that she wants another try. She wants a fresh strart and come spring when all of her pretty flowers are bloming and geting there chance she wants her now chance to pass best.	0	0		0																					
2818	4	After reading �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. I believe Ho ended the story with that paragraph to support her idea of overcoming  obstacles. First after failing her driving test, Saeng was very upset and didn�t know if she would ever pass it. But after seeing a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her home in Vietnam which inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive. But, after seeing how the plant brought joy to Saeng, her mother forgave her. Last when saeng was digging a hole to let the hibiscus grow, it inspired Saeng to take the test again because she overcame the obstacles of brining the plant home and letting it grow. Therefore, I believe Ho end �Winter Hibiscus�, to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles.	2	2		2																					
2821	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.	1	1		1																					
2823	4	"He ended the paragraph like that because he @MONTH1 want you to read on, or it could be that he is showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when. the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ""The quote is showing the flower can fight through the winter and come back. Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to retake the test. Which shows that they both have modivation and the integrity to come back."	1	2		2																					
2824	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, �When they com back, Saeng vowed silently to hersef, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take that test again�. I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her com fort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", This implies a new beginning so the hibiscus is representing Saeng. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2826	4	I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to get used to the new country and surroundings. In the story, the author is showing home sickness. The author see a plant that is know where she come from and buy for over @NUM1 her mother couldn�t believe it. She didn�t want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again. The last sentence is showing that author is trying to adapt.	1	1		1																					
2829	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it expresses the meaning of the story. Life continues no matter what, the hibiscus will return again in the spring. The hibiscus is like a symbol to Saeng's life. The plant normally doesn't survive in winter months, but this one did. The mother says, ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are just like the plant. They are strong and their lives will continue even though they are in a  new environment The author chose to end the story with that parragraph because even  though she say the hibiscus will come back every spring the deeper meaning is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will continue to live their lives."	2	2		2																					
2831	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story. I said this idea because in the story he talks about orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vires surrounded her. It talks about how these flowers surrounded her to test her. Of her @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
2832	4	I think the Author concludes this in the story because. It is a key information for this story. Because. It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom	1	0		1																					
2833	4	Saeng thinks that she has failed because she misses her grandmother. The hiscubus plant that she buys reminds her of grandmother�s scent. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant. She needed it to feel a little bit more at home. Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in �a blink.� Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her. Saeng needs to think of the good and smile when she is reminded of her past. Saeng wants to pass the test. next time the hibiscus are budding she must not cry.	1	1		1																					
2834	4	The reason I think that the author did it is because wanted you to know what time it took place and what the weather was like then it also so tells you how long she is going to wait like till the snow melts and that is going to be while and when the geese live and return home so this is why I think she tells you what is like.	0	0		0																					
2837	4	The author concludes story with that paragraph because she wants there to be hope for the future seeing that hibiscus budding in the spring is what Saeng is waiting for. It gives her hope that she will be able to pass that test again. This is showed when she says �.. and this  hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ��@CAPS1 the winter ,Saeng hopes she will improve and when the hibiscus  buds she will know that it is time to try again .Saeng sees the spring as a new beginning. So that means it is a time to overcme her obstade.I think that obstade or test might be to not cry when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she is growing just like the hibiscus     	2	3		3																					
2838	4	The author concludes the story with that paragrap for one main reason.	0	0		0																					
2839	4	The author is showing that Saeng wants to keep on with her mother's gardening. To take over an elders traditions and what her mother started.	0	0		0																					
2842	4	 In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her � gentle grandmother� from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story �Winter Hibiscus � with the paragraph selected.	3	2		3																					
2843	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. For example, it shows a sense of hope, when she says �this hibiscus is budding"". That indicates a new beginning or starting over. I think that is the idea the author is trying to get across. Obviously it was difficult for the author to adjust to her new country. For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus wasn�t the same as the one in her homeland. Even though she's feeling hostalgic; this paragraph reassures the reader that the author is willing to give her new country another chance."	2	2		2																					
2845	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show she loved them flowers. That they met a whole lot to her. When she failed her driven test she was sad. An the flower made her feel better. now that the snow is failing she waits untill spring that when they come up and she will have faith and take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2846	4	The author concluded this sentence because he was letting everyone know that Saeng would return to the hibiscus and take care of it still, and that she has not forgotten about it.	0	0		0																					
2854	4	The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion.	1	1		1																					
2857	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.	0	0		0																					
2861	4	She will go back to where she started. Its a circle and she will be back the next year where she began.	0	0		0																					
2863	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� ecause that flower budding would make her feel confident about everything. The reason I think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland. It�s basically like she has a little peice of home in her new home. An example that represents this is, �Not like the kind we had before,� this is explaining the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this reminds her of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story the way they do,	2	1		2																					
2867	4	The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to adjust to her new home and that she will not give up. You can tell that she still misses her homeland by her reaction to seeing the hibiscus plant, but also that she is growing accustomed to her new home because of how she recognizes the geese and will make the decision if when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns.	2	1		2																					
2869	4	The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to state that the season of the flowers is over and is to be held off until the spring so that give the author a point where he/she can end the story and begin on a new one for when the flowers come back in the spring so inconclusion this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph that they chose.	1	1		1																					
2871	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of how it related to when Saeng failed her driving test. But she was determind to take it over when she feels shes. ready and the paragraph sad ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again."""	1	1		1

2876	4	The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.� Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom.	2	2		2																					
2878	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it�s saying that she can�t work in the garden in winter, but �when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,� are all signs of spring. In the spring, she will take the test again; which implys that she will work in the garden.	0	0		0																					
2879	4	The author concludes the story like this @CAPS2 the Author (Minfong Ho) is telling you what will happen in spring time. I @CAPS1 this @CAPS2 the text say's Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again. This means that in spring the hibiscus will @CAPS3.	0	0		0

2881	4	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph becauses it symbolizes Saeng�s decision to try again. Things in nature are repeatative, seasons change but eventually they appear again, geese migrate but they too return and the author used this as a comparsion to Saeng�s decision to try for her license again. Just like Saeng the winter hibiscus was out of. As normal environment but was learning to adapt and that inspired Saeng to keep an trying even if she failed because the hibiscus was trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place.	2	2		2																					
2884	4	Its the start of a new life. She has a new new school and a new plant, Its is like she has a connection to the plant, when it grow she grows stronger and more confident. That�s when she said when they come back when the hibiscus is budding she will be ready for that test.	1	1		1																					
2885	4	The author ends it with that because it shows that she won�t give up and that she will give her new country a chance. She ends it with that to say that she will be strong like the flower and that she will stay no matter what! That she will be there, in that spot to see it grow back. That's why I think she concluded with that.	1	1		1																					
2890	4	The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.	1	1		1

2896	4	"The author chose this paragraph because it fit right like a good conclusion showed for example the word again it means that you did something already and it's over but you miss so you retry what you miss, but in the paragraph it's talking about the nature and how they want to test it!(""again"")!."	0	0		0																					
2898	4	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young girl from vietnam moves to @LOCATION1 and fails the drivers test. After she decides to spend money on a winter hibiscus to remind her of her homeland, The ending paragraph, ""who troy come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. shows deep feeling towards nature. She feels as when the Geese we ready to return home and when the hibiscus is ready to bud so will she and she will take to drivers test again."	1	2		2																					
2899	4	She is talking about the flowers and win she says test I think she means how she looks  and exameans the flowers and see the snow fall all over again. It sounds like the author is some one how admayers flowers a lot or maybe just this one hibiscus and how it buddies. Maybe she is just some one how likes to see changes.	1	1		1																					
2900	4	I believe the author adds this passage to the Story to represent determination and @LOCATION1. While Saeng is not originally from @LOCATION2 she is determined and willing to try and. adapt to our @CAPS1. While the winter was cold and harsh in many ways for her, the Spring will Bring foregiveness and relief from her @CAPS2. She will try to pass the driving test again to further herself into american @CAPS1, while the blooming of the Hibiscus will bring her @CAPS4 to home.	2	2		2																					
2901	4	"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"". The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese & the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one."	2	3		3																					
2902	4	She wanted to learn, and do more things. She loved the way the plants looked at the store. Her mother got the plant, went home, and they started planting it. The daughter loved the plant very much. And she said that next year I�ll grew a plant as wonderful as the oh her mom was growing.	0	0		0																					
2903	4	I think the author concludes this paragraph in this story to describe how grown up Saeng is now since it doesn�t look like she leaves with her mom anymore. To the author probably wants to emphasize the reader @CAPS1 of Saeng, now on for she probably leave since she doesn't leave with her mom anymore. In what happen was just her past and will be memorable to Saeng.	0	0		0																					
2904	4	"The author uses that passage to end the story to show that Saeng will try to adopt. When Saeng smells the Hibiscus �The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng [she] could almost feel. The light sounds of her grandmother�s long gray hair"" This @CAPS1 that Saeng was looking for things that were familiar to her and reminded her of her homeland. The fact that Saeng paid over nineteen dollars for a plant also @CAPS1 how much she missed her homeland. ""d-d failed the test that Saeng paid.� @CAPS1 the reader that she attempted to adapt to her new home but failed. This makes her sad and causes her to miss the way things used to be. at the end of the story she said that ""I [she] will late the test again."" seeing the familiar hibiscus and geese leaver knowing that they will return gives Saeng hope. the last time in the story @CAPS1 the regard they @CAPS2 will always remember her homeland  "	3	2		3																					
2906	4	With the hibiscus around Saeng she will have more courage and also have had more time to adapt in their new home. For Saeng the hibiscus is like motivation and it also reminds her. Of her old homeland. The reason I think the author choose to end the story with the paticular comment is to show that Saeng had in the end found courage and is ready to accept her tasks in this foreign land.  	0	0		0																					
2908	4	In the story the �winter Hibiscus� by minfong Ho the writers ends with a paragraph that concludes the story. One of the reasons she concluded with the last paragraph the @CAPS1 she did is because it tells the reader that Saeng  @CAPS1 not given up on her drivers test. �� Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� This explains in more details when  she will take the test Again another years on is because it leaves the reader to think how the rest of the story will go.	1	2		2																					
2909	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, was a great way to end it becase I think that she sees how much the hibiscus can take then she can take just about anything mainly the test. Also when her mother said �You what?� �Her mother stared at her incredulously�. Sh might have also understood that if her mum could get over being mad then she would over come being upset about the test.	2	2		2																					
2910	4	The writes this this conclusion to the end of the story because he wants people to know that the season's are changing and the flowers are going to be dying. He also wants you you to know that when the season changes back the flower will try and fit again with the other flowers. that�s what the author means when he talks about taking the test again.	0	0		0																					
2913	4	The author leaves us at the end of the story saying �when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author is said that because the girl Saeng failed the test but still found something that remined her of her home. She was happy, but the plant were not exactly like the one from home. But she got used to it. The flower @MONTH1 not be the same but it�s an @CAPS1 flower and she is getting used to beining in @LOCATION1. When she goes back to take the test she will be ready and so will her plant. Her plant will full of life.	1	1		1																					
2914	4	I think the author ends the story like this becuose of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a simple of her home but also as a symble of good luck. In the text she holds the plant in a very high value, having payed @NUM1 coins for it, So I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing.	1	1		1																					
2918	4	Because she saying when the @CAPS1 grow back she will be @CAPS2 to take the test again.	3	3		3																					
2920	4	"In the story �the Winter Hibiscus"", I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the memories  of  her old country would always be with her but she soon will adapt to her new one. Also from time to time she still will visit her old country. For example �when the show melts and the geese return"", The last sentences, then I will take the test again�, This sentence means that once she is adapted to this country on goes back to her old one she still will enjoy their either way."	1	1		1																					
2921	4	The author conclude the story with this paragraph to show that saeng is going to retake the test over when all these things happen. Saeng shows that she is not going to give up, and that she is going to keep trying. The hibiscus is a lucky charm to her to keep during the test to strive her to pass the test. In addition, the author also conclude the story with this paragraph to show saeng personal thoughts, and how she feels about this test. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, is a indication that it time to give the test another try. In conclusion, the paragraph is a indication that saeng is never going to forget.	2	1		2

2924	4	In �Winter Hibiscus�, the author concludes with Saeng saying �I will take that test, again, it means that Saeng will be ready as soon as the spring arrives and her hibiscus is all in bloom. When Saeng bought the hibiscus, she was sure that as soon as the winter passes with the coming of spring, she is sure that taking the drivers test, again will be easier to overcome the fear and grieving times in a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. Saeng is also sure that the memories of her homeland will help her, too. In the end, its revealed that Saeng has become strong and has high hopes to see her success be fulfilled in her new homeland.	2	1		2																					
2925	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows he determination. In the spring it will be hard for the hibiscus to survive because its a winter hibiscus and it also has determination.	1	1		1

2929	4	The past experiences of our lives often  influence things in our life, weather we consciously know it or not. In this story Saeng  tries to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the cestain  flower that reminels her of her home, when she fails. She is trying to get over the fact that she is not �at home,� that things and people that use to be ground no longer are. But there are new things that she is becoming used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can alway�s  change. She is trying to put things that make her used further  back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year, because it is always possible to do something if you really wants to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng  really wants to pass her own mind test, so she can further adapt to change, her mother will be proud of her.	3	2		3																					
2930	4	I think that she was that way to say, hey I didn�t over come something and I�ll be back next year to take the test again like the hibiscus budding when she snow melts and the geese return @CAPS1 year.	1	1		1																					
2931	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted the readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test over again.	1	1		1																					
2933	4	The authors choice of the last paragraph in the short story, �Winter Hibiscus shows the hope for the future that seang feels. The winter and cold represent how she feels out of place and upset at not receiving her driver�s license. In the spring she will have a piece of her homeland blooming and she will be warm again. She will feel ready to take her test again �when they came back. This shows adapting to and accepting her new life away from her home and her memories. The last paragraph proves that she was strong enough to move past her hardships and move on	2	2		2																					
2935	4	"The author conclude the story with the paragraph ""when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese returned this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.

2937	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, �when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again.	1	1		1

The message of this story is no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. The author makes that the last paragraph to make the reader think and ponder upon what it means.	1	1		1																					
2942	4	�When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows. Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that�s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers. Last of all Saeng she sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flowrist shop to see if it can be purchased and Saeng gets highly upset when something goes wrong with them.	0	0		0																					
2948	4	The author finished the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason for conclusion is that it is important for Saeng  to feel at home. When the hibiscus buds it wiil remind her of home and this will comfort her, when she feels at peace and at home she will do better on the test.	1	1		1																					
2949	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one. She shows she isn�t giving up when she brings home the flower to plant. That also shows she will not forget her old home. Also when she says, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� That shows she is giving her new home another shot and isn�t giving up. Another example is when it says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance. She is not giving up on it.	2	2		2																					
2951	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes �she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs� after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of �combing her grandmother�s long grey hair, freshly washed� it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn�t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was �exquisite� and as she said the @CAPS1 word �dokor malik� meaning hibiscus she �savored the feel of the word on her tongue.� @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when �the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels.	3	2		3																					
2952	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and her situation in a new country. It shows that Saeng is using the hibiscus and its ability to adapt for inspiration. During the story, Saeng describes how she had always seen the hibiscus at home in her old country. Her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home. But she says it�s because it�s strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the United States. This is what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She might have failed her lisence test, but she used the hibiscus actions to set a goal for herself. The plant will go through a cold, and snowy winter but it will grow and blossom in the spring. Saeng would use that time to study and get ready, and she�ll be confident for the test. The paragraph that the author finishes on shows the connection Saeng made with her situation and the plant�s situation.	2	3		3																					
2953	4	�If at first you don�t succeed, try, try again.� This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng�s situation in the short story, �Winter Hibiscus.� Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.� This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter.	3	3		3																					
2954	4	The author ends the story this way because Saeng feels a sence of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother. According to the story �the familiar frogrence filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair.� you can also tell she misses her homeland but always keeps it close to her heart whereever she goes. The text states that, �it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.� She seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits. When she failed the test she bought her �@CAPS1 Malik� flower, as a sence of comfort. They both decided to plant it in their garden and while doing so, Saeng received a huge boost of confidence to retake the test.  	2	2		2																					
2958	4	"I think that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because she wanted us to see that Saeng was not giving up Saeng was originally from Vietnam but she moved to the United States. She missed being home so much because nothing was the same. �It�s not a real one,� Saeng mumbled. �I mean, not like the kind we had at-at'. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. �But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, she decided that she was going to give the drive�s test one more try. �When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""	2	2		2																					
2960	4	I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imagen what happens next once spring rolls around for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their imagenation to connect to the story. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that with that paragraph was to give hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time. It was also a way to end the story in a good note.	2	1		2																					
2961	4	The auther ended the story with that preticular paragraph because like the geese she will be back to try again. Just in case she didn�t get to finish JUST about everything she wanted to do and that the auther wanted the reader to know the determination and ambition of the character in the story. Also to show the readers that the characters characteristics couldn�t be beat by one winter and that she is going to keep going at it untill she does what she has to do.	1	1		1																					
2965	4	"The auther includes this at the end to show how much she cares about the plant and that she seils brought back her back to her childhood. An example of her loving the plant is that rich scent"" (Paragraph Minfong Ho), @CAPS1 examples �It felt smooth and cool� (paragraph Minfong Ho) An example of to childhood's plan is that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten. she come back we could reed (paragraphs Minfong Ho) For these ways think that is why the author adds that at the end."	1	1		1																					
2967	4	I think the author wrote that because maybe that how she fells like in the winter she could really show people who she is but when spring come out she like a flower that has been dead all winter  	0	0		0																					
2971	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng said she failed the test, and when spring comes back then she will take the test again. The last paragraph reads �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� She really does not tell us what test she is supposed to be taking.	1	1		1																					
2973	4	The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story.	1	1		1																					
2974	4	I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that, is that it awhave ending. also so you know that the story is that they could make more.	1	1		1																					
2976	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. Saeng is going to wait to take the test whe n she knows that she will past the test so she can get her licesned. Saeng wants her licesned so she can drive anywhere she wants to go. So she don't have to get her mom to take her everywhere she wants to go she can take her ownself anywhere she wants. But she has to wait till the snows is melted before she takes her test again.	1	1		1																					
2986	4	Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding. And what she means by this ending sentence is that when the spring time comes, then she is going to take that test again. the test will determine whether or not she has learned enough about gardening from her mother over the past time.	0	0		0																					
2987	4	The author concludes the Story with this paragraph because I guess her grandma died while the geese were flying. Or thats when the flowers start to bloom.	0	0		0																					
2990	4	The author ended the story with an unconcluded ending. What I mean is the author wrote so that he could keep readers interested so that they would want to read his other books. Also, with an ending of that sort it kind of leaves room for improving and room for a sequal.	1	1		1																					
2991	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up until she successfully passes the task he mother gives her.Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant it is much to expensive. �But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn�t cost that much!� Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has failed her mother. Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. �Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the �winter hibiscus� into it.� This shows that even though she had failed she wasn�t going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home. It was very special to her.	1	1		1																					
2993	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story the character � Saeng� is feeling homesick and has not adapted to her new country. She is on her way home from her driver�s test, which she just failed, and on the way she sports a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hishiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort in time of disappoint, connection to her past experiences and ability to overcome obsticales. Saeng has not adjusted to this change in her life and it has affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obsticates in your life but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome it. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and showing the reader that saeng was the hibiscus as her way of overcoming and when she is ready and she has ajusted she will take her driving test again.	3	2		3																					
2994	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he�s saying that once winter and spring�s over and the hibiscus is budding, then I�ll start over again and try again. The author is saying saeng can�t wait till spring so she can plant her own little garden. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2995	4	"This paragraph represents an action that Saeng is going to do over a time period of a year. She is going to build up and change in time for the retake of the test its like a rebirth in a way. The girl wants to be a whole new person for when the test comes up again. Her mom seems to be bothered by every action or choice of her daughters. The daughter suddenly relizes the action for the hibiscus and why it dies. ""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season."" She relates the flower and geese to herself. Over the year the flower goes through phases dying then rebirth. Saeng wants to get better once she goes through a phase like the flower. Its opens up to be beautiful again.  "	2	3		3																					
2996	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when she come back from taking driver's test on the way home she saw winter hibiscus that was so beautiful. Then she went to the store and buy that flowers and it cost a lot of money when she got home and her mom planting vejetable and her mom ark her what is that so she tell th truth and her know that the flower costs a lot of money she get mad with the dheredulously of her how can she do that - Saeng take a big decision that she going to that eventhough her mom mad she she love that flowers I guess because it remaind of in Vietnam. The author put this paragraph I think because that the geese return and the flowers is growth she will take the test again bease that when she buy is no flowers came out yet so when it came out she will go again just to let her know that you see the first time and waite when it growth than you can take the test again In my onpion that is a good ending and also it a good question too.	1	2		2																					
2997	4	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese."	3	2		3																					
2998	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the �snow does melt and the Geese return� it will be time t plant and work in the garden even more, because with snow on the ground you can�t plant but the geese back if the time of year to plant the seed and have are bad flock/fasten grander. The test is to she if she can have a better grade than last years, and year befor that.	0	0		0																					
3001	4	The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese.	1	1		1																					
3004	4	The author end with that paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she has failed this time, more opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times befall her now, good times are still to come. For several reasons, it was a powoful efficient way to end the story.	1	1		1																					
3006	4	She wrote that response to tell everyone   that  she  will  be ready  but the time when spring  comes.    Then   she  take it and pass.	1	1		1																					
3009	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� a young girl named Saeng moves away from home. This short story is the girl is trying to adapt to the new lifestyle and changes.	1	1		1																					
3011	4	"In the stoRy �WinteR Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authoR leaves the stoRy off with a poweRful ending. The ending was �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRself, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese RetuRn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will tRy the test again"". Basically the authoR concluded the stoRy with that because it shows she's poweRful, that she's willing to tRy and make heRself stRongeR, that she's willing to tRy again, and that she wants to help heRself. Text examples to pRoove this would be, �then I will take the hibiscus test again,"" ""Almost Reluctantly, she Realized that many of the things that she had thought of as stRange befoRe had become..."", and ""TheRe was a fRail, wiRy beauty to heR that touched Saeng deeply."" All those statements help backup why the authoR might leave such poweRful paRagRaph foR last."	1	2		2																					
3016	4	In the story �winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. She puts in examples from the story that could help find these reasons. One reason is that we know she wont give up. In the story she says �Then I will take the test again.� It tells us that she will keep trying and is determined to do so. Another reason is that she�s trying to tell us that there is a future for the hibiscus. How is when she says ��and this hibiscus is budding,� that the hibiscus has a chance to change and get use to its surroundings, just like the girl in the story will be doing. Last reason is that it tells us that she is and will be doing her best. When she says �she realized that many of the things that she had thought were strange�, almost familiar to her now,� @CAPS1 trying to get use to her surroundings and now realizes she can. In the story there are many reasons to suspect shy she ended the story with that paragraph. She gives examples in the story that makes many people get many	3	2		3																					
3018	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she misses her home and that affected her driving test. At her home country it was warm and she had all her family memories. In the new country it is cold and snowy, something she isn�t used to. It states she will take the test again when all them things happen because it will feel like her home country and she will be more focused on the test and not what she misses.	1	2		2																					
3021	4	I think the author conclades the story with this paragraph because it sounds hopeful. She wasn�t adapting to her new home very well and that made her feel hopeless.Saeng failed her driving test which only made things worse for her. To make things better, she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home. She found the plant to be very comforting and it helped her get passed the tough times. In the last paaragraph, Saeng is looking forward to the spring so she can retake the test and hopefully pass it this time. I think the paragraph provides a feeling of hopefulness which is way the author concluded the story the way they did.	2	2		2																					
3022	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and there is still hope. It is also to teach the reader to have hope and patience and the knowledge that things take time. Saeng failed the test of not giving into her sorrows and misery of missing her country. She says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This shows that she is adjusting. So by ending it with this and comparing to the geese, its showing that she is getting stronger. She will take the test again because she wont give up.	2	2		2																					
3027	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because she wants to come back an an do smell test again when the snow melts and the geese return.	0	0		0																					
3028	4	The @ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl named Saeng She is a teenager her family just moved to the United States from Vietnam, Saeng failed her driving test and on the walk home discovers this beautiful plant named Hibiscus she falls in love with the Hibiscus. Saeng's mother has a garden she is always planting things a using plarts a veggies from her garden for dinner. The author conclude a paragraph that says where the Hibiscus plants are budding in the spring Saeng with take the test again. I think Saeng says this because she wants to see the beautiful plants When she passes the test and she thinks seeing th Hibiscus will help her passthe driving test.	1	2		2																					
3029	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test. The hibiscus will have started sprouting and the will give her the strength to take the test again and hopeful pass it all because of the winter hibiscus reminded her of home.	2	1		2																					
3031	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that saeng won�t give up. It is possible to adapt and try to love whats around you. Saeng struggled to get out �I-I failed the test� and couldn�t say �at home� this shows her insecurity and lonleiness for the new world around her and by saying she will try again in the spring gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an expirence today that old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now they have some simalarities and because she will try again in the spring means she has decided to go to give a new place a chance.	2	2		2																					
3033	4	I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It basically sumarizises the story and sums it up into few words that would want you to wonder what happened next, and if there is a sequel. This is a very good story that I personally can relate to in many ways.	1	1		1																					
3038	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paraghragh because when she told her mom she failed her test she was crying, But I think it was deeper than that. I think she missed home so much that she couldn't concentrate. She had to cry about something because she didn't want to let her mom know that she misses home.	1	1		1																					
3040	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing that the hibiscus inspires her and gives comfort that no person could try and do. For example, after Saeng failed her drivers test, she was disappointed. On her way home she saw a hibiscus and went to a florist shop to try and buy it. Saeng took a peddle from the plant and held it tightly while she closed her eyes. The plant reminded her of her real home in vietnam which she loved. The hibuscus became a form of comfort for Saeng since she had just failed her drivers test, even though the plant was not the same as the one at home. By the author ending the story with Saeng saying she will wait until the hibiscus starts budding to take the test again, it shows that the hibiscus helps her to overcome obstacles in life and it helps her to get through hardships she faces.	2	1		2																					
3043	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because is symbolizes the hope that things will get better. The author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year. So can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will. This is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note. The girl spends the entire day wishing that she were back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends. But this paragraph is the girl vowing a promise to her self that she will withstand the winter until spring and it will get better when she can take the test again. The entire story builds up to this turning point when Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter. Saeng realizes that it is going to take time for her to adapt to this new and strange country and the new lifestyle that she must adopt	3	3		3																					
3045	4	What the author is talking about is that the snow was melting and the spring is coming. I guess what they mean is that flowers, trees and grass are going back beautiful. Also he was letting us know that spring is here and that is not winter nomore. Thats why she start to plant plants in the winter. So in the spring that can grow out to be nice and beautiful for the spring. Thats what i think the author meant. Also thats the reason why he put that in the paragraph. He should of add more to the paragraph like how the plants and stuff was growing so beautiful. He shouldn't add more details to let us know, what was talking about in this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3051	4	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng was a very determined person. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng was a strong character because throughout the story she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time. But when she failed, the author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up hope and that she was going to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3053	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because he is making a point about immigration. The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to @CAPS1 they were told to forget where they were from . The word test in the story means getting used to @LOCATION1 and forgetting her homeland. Saeng  says thoes words because she failed the test and bought something that reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion the Author is describing how immigrants were treated and told to forget who they were because their in @LOCATION1 now."	0	1		1																					
3054	4	In the story �Winter @CAPS1� the author was trying to saying that Saeng was from somewhere then where he is now. In the text It say�s �It was like walking into another world so he is there thinking like no boby know him except for him and him only.	0	0		0																					
3057	4	In the end of the story they say that she will take the test over again, in the spring when the geese come back from the winter fly. What they are saying is that she will make a fresh start in the spring when the geese come back, so she would just be starting all over again fresh new start to a new year and a new time to study for the big test and time to regroup from the last test that she took and failed the test she will just get a new start and a new chance to do something over again. Her mom was in disbelief when she found out that she failed the test, her mom said to her that it will be ok and you can take it over again, in a new season,	1	2		2																					
3059	4	The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to end on a good note and show hope for the future. First, throughout the story Saeng felt lonely and depressed because she missed her home in Vietnam. With all this depression Saeng saw the winter hibiscus that reminded her of her childhood memories. She felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life. The flower represented the light and hope for the future. Next, it shows perserverance factor in the story Saeng fails her drivers test and came home feeling unacomplished. When she says she will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms it shows perserverance and never giving up. Lastly, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and show a positive outlook on life. No matter where you come from with love and perserverance you can overcome any obstacle. Whether it be your school, tests or home with a little hardwork and faith you can achieve.	3	3		3																					
3061	4	MY detail on Saeng vowed silentlY to herself because she had difficuiltY makeing new friends. She like to plant stuff around her because she feels like Plants are her friends, Saeng took the shovel and finished the planting for her mom that make Saeng feel so good. about herself.	0	0		0																					
3062	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus �decided to end the story with this paragraph because its like a new beginning for saeng. In saeng moves and fails the test .The winter hibiscus comforts her from the memories of where she used to live. It gives her hope and in the winter it wouldn�t be as nice as it would be in the spring. Spring is also time for new beginnings because in the winter everything dies and comes back to life in spring .saeng feels she would take the test as a new beginning. From my personal experience I always do spring cleaning because I want to begin fresh. Spring is also filled with fresh air and gives me inspiration to do good. This could be why saeng wants to take the test in the spring time. Therefore the author of �Winter Hibiscus �decided to end the story with that paragraph because they wanted to show how saeng wanted a new beginning.  	3	2		3																					
3064	4	The author, Minfong  Ho, concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The  �budding hibiscus� symbolizes comfort for her. When moving to @LOCATION1 she couldn�t take all her friends a possessions with her, but she could bring memories. The flower reminds her of home, which is comforting after she failed her drivers test. In addition, the �geese returning� symbolizes a new beginning. After being away for so long, the geese returning ushers  in springs a time to start all over after a dreasy  winter. Finally �;,.then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 that one should never give up. Even though ve was hard for her to adapt to a new  country, she made friends a tried @CAPS2 foods, like a Big @CAPS3. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the story with the paragraph to show comfort, new beginnings  a never give up.	3	3		3																					
3071	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is waiting for a better time. It shows that she is has perserverance and will not give up on passing this test. She realizes that life comes and goes very quickly. And thAt she needs to appreciate it	1	1		1																					
3074	4	The author minFong @CAPS1 concludes the story with this paragraph to envoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessions anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try. Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that �never giving up is important� is presented and carried out hopefully through the character�s vow. This principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with. In conclusion, hope is envoked within the reader because of the ending paragraph which contributes to the over all theme of the entire story; it is important to never give up and always have hope especially when life gets hard.	2	2		2																					
3075	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sounds better and it makes the story sound a bit more better when the author put that paragraph in the start. If the author did not put that ending at the end of the story the story probably wouldnt be that intresting and be that good of a story if the author didn�t put that ending paragraph at the end of the story. Also the author wants to make the reader understand the story end end or the start all at the same time. For example if there were no good ending at the end of this story no body would want to read at all not a bit so it was a good thing for the author to put a good end stable ending paragraph at the end of the story. I think ic it was a very good paragraph for the end of the story. It just really seemed to mach the story and I could also really understand it a lot better because of the ending paragraph. It was just the perfect ending for this story.	0	0		0																					
3077	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to say in the spring when the plant starts over Saeng will start over to. The story shows that this is the meaning because Saeng was having a really hard winter and was having a hard time adjusting to all of the new things, but in the spring she can start over just like the hibiscus will.	1	1		1																					
3080	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphisise the theme that changes in life are hard to adjust to. Saeng has moved to @LOCATION1 and longs for home. The flowers in the greenhouse reminds her of where she grew up and her grandmother. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying. She tells her mom that she did not pass the test but in the last paragraph she vowed to herself that by spring she will. The author is giving us insight to Saeng's character. We now know that eventhough it is difficult for Saeng to let go of what she knows and love, she will have the strength to make it in a new world.?"	2	2		2																					
3081	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show us that her days with nature is not yet over, for when it comes back around, she will continue to do what she been was doing, whicvh was growing her plants, taking care of them, tuning them out to being a goodnight dinner, and to continue that until she�s no longer to do anymore.	0	0		0																					
3083	4	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a new country. In this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so. Saeng took a test and failed and in the winter, flowers fail but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms Saeng will ""bloom"" and try the test again. Moving can be a hardship especially when it is to place very unfimiliar. People find ways to make themselves promises & to remind them of their old home."	2	2		2																					
3084	4	The author concludes the stoRy with this paragraph because this spRing she had made a mistake like buying the plants that were oveR @MONEY1 (dollaRs) and her motheR who disappointed with heR. So she figuRes That when The spRing comes again she could get another oppoRtuniy to do her best and to get it right This time. Also so she will not be a disappointment to heR motheR.	1	1		1																					
3086	4	I believe that the author concluded the story �Winter @CAPS1� with the paragraph that she did in order to imply that Saeng will not give up. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was very sad about failing the test, but will take the test again infers that Saeng is a determined person. It is my belief that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the feeling that Saeng was determined despite hardships.	2	1		2																					
3088	4	Mingfong Ho closes the story with that paragraph because it shows how far Saeng has come and her determination to persevere. The narrator says, �She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance �(Ho @NUM1). This is when Saeng is recovering from crying and even though she misses her homeland, she wants to adapt and succeed where she is now. The narrator also said, �she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again� (Ho @NUM1). Being away from her homeland makes Saeng very ??? (not legible)	2	2		2																					
3089	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they feel that the plant will bring them luck or something. Saeng feels that the plant gives her some type of comforte. 	1	1		1																					
3090	4	I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because in the story, the author says �through the quiet repitition of season upon season� which means that seasons will come a seasons will go but she�ll always be there, ready to �take the test�	1	1		1																					
3093	4	The author conclude the story with her saying in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. to say the she will not gust out like that.	1	1		1																					
3094	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 It mean so many things about her in just one little sentence. For example ""take that test again"" she willing to do it all over again @CAPS1 she love it and want to do it. Also when she said ""in spring; when the snows melts and the gesse return and this hibicous is' budding"" from that when you come back and don't forget about all the things she just list. That why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. "	1	1		1																					
3095	4	This story about believed in yourself, and never giving up it was a story about perseverance. Saeng really believed she could pass her driver's test, and although she was disappointed with result, she found a way to cope with her loss. The hibiscus that flower means a lot to her because she can connect it to her homeland and, and it is a thing of beauty. something she needed at such an ugly time for her. It's always hard o adapt to a new country in a short period of time. I know what it's like when one small thing goes wrong. You can snap and it will feel a lot worse than it actually is. You feel helpless and alone just like the hibiscus growing next to the highway in the photo. Saeng vowed to take her driver�s test again when her hibiscus would bloom in the spring I think the hibiscus really symbolizes Saeng as a person.	2	3		3																					
3096	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons, Saeng was dissapointed for failing her driving test. She found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus his not started to bud, she should not take the drivers test. She feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus. This implies nature comforts her. The author ended it like this because it shows Saeng is not disappointed about failing is anymore. She knows she will have another chance next year when the geese returns and the hibiscus starts to bud. With the comfort of nature, she feels she can pass the test next year.  	2	2		2																					
3097	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph or quote to get the readers something to think about at the end of the reading. For example, It lets the reader now that the person will continue to grow plant when the winter is done.	0	0		0																					
3099	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up. She also concludes with this to tell people that they should never give up and that the should keep on trying. Even if they have to take a break to study or rethinks the plan.	1	1		1																					
3100	4	When they came back ,saeng voed silenty to herseif in the spring when the snow melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then i will take that test again .in the story the author put the  paragraph in his story to show what the  girl was doing to improve on her grades.	0	0		0																					
3103	4	She say cloning the spring I will take the test again because she know if she failed the test againg her mother will be disappointed of her because she not trying hard enough or maybe them too him never be closer again. The mother think jst because she keep failing the test because of her connection to her past expeirences or effection for her new country. and ability to overcome obstacles ar finally I think she is comforted by memories or her homland..	1	1		1																					
3106	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed. Since she has failed the test the first time she wants to overcome her failure and succede in it so the author wants her to look determined in the end.	1	1		1																					
3108	4	The plant was important to Saeng because it was from her home land. Saeng said that she would take her drivers test again when her plant bloomed. The plant wos a reamder of her home I and and what she come from. The plant to Saeng was a form of confidance. Saeng went through handtimes and the plant wos close to her because it wos from her home land.	2	1		2																					
3109	4	I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder. I think this because if you put into context the word �test�, it could mean many things. For example it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of her situation. Also it could mean the test to adjust to her new home when the spring comes. That is why I think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph.	1	2		2																					
3110	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho,is about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing �when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test @NUM1). The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on her way home had seen an assortment of flowers that were indigenous to her homeland. �Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost @NUM2) The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged. Her mother states �It�s flowers aren�t as pretty but it�s strong enough. That�s what @NUM3). Saeng , after hearing this, decides that she could be strong, too, and would try to do her best in school. She would adapt just like the winter hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
3112	4	I believe that the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows the ending of one thing and the beginning of another.After she is upset and thinks about home she realizes that something new is happening and she needs to accept it.So therefore  in the spring she is going to start new like the flower blossom.	1	1		1																					
3115	4	The author ends this story with this paragraph because she is explaining her thoughts and why she is taking that test. She is explaining that next year she will find out if it feels like home to her.	0	0		0																					
3117	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because this paragraph represent saeng�s determination and the situation she has now. She just come to the new country and she haven�t adjusted herself to this new country yet. She was disappointed like �mashaft of the war afternoon starlight.� �war� showed saeng was ery upset. After she met the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland she missed it. She felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home. Last she burst into tears again. She missed her homelad very much �snows"" symbolized the difficult situation she had now. But she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. �spring� symbolized the hope to the new life saeng thought things would get better in the spring. She would succeed in the spring. She had the determination to succeed, so the author uses that paragraph at conclusion. It symbolizes hope."	3	2		3																					
3118	4	The author included this because she felt that since Saeng failed the test that maybe she should be given a second chance because she tried so hard before. When Saeng says �Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.� It made her mom upset because she used alot of money for one plant just so she could feel at home again since she had one when she was at her old home. Eventually her mom say, �It�s a beautiful plant� to make her feel better because she feels bad for how she acted towards her daughter. After all the things Saeng had to go through is the reason the author added the the last passage into the story.	1	1		1																					
3122	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she saying when everything gets back to normal that�s when she is going to take the test again. Second, because there would be nothing else to say if it is not back to the way she wanted it to be. For instance, if you were building an house and a blizzared came, you would stop, you said that you would not continue until there was nice weather again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.	1	1		1																					
3123	4	The author of winter Hibiscus , Minfong Ho ended the story in this way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying. �Its flowers aren�t as pretty but it�s strong enough to make it through the winter. That�s what matters. �Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their lives again in @LOCATION1, that @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as pretty, but it will survive, which is what matters. Her words soothe her daughters worries about starting ore. Also, the budding hibiscus could be considered asymbol of rebirth, since it is dying and growing with the seasons.The family is dying in out a @CAPS1 family & being @CAPS2 was an @CAPS3 family. However even though they �died� as a @CAPS1 family, that does not meqan that they have lost their heritage which is why the author end talking about a flower that is both @CAPS1 & @CAPS3 just like Saeng.	3	3		3																					
3124	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will perservere through the winter and try to adapt to her new lifestyle. Moving to a new country / culture is extremely tough, and Saeng is bad, but she doesn�t  give up on creating a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,� is one of determination and hope. The entire story Saeng was struggling with adapting to her non of  and memory of her homeland give has a sense of security. The sentence wraps up her emotion and shows how strong she is @CAPS1  could easily give up on their driving test, but she won�t. It is a happy ending for somewhat of a sad story. Furthering the sentence shows Saeng�s dwoton  the her plant. This hibiscus will survive and so will Saeng when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so will Saeng. She will try as hard she can to fit in and enjoy her new life. That plant will help her through it by reminding her of vietnam us will as giving her a companion throughout the winter. The  author would not have chosen a better  conclusion for this story. The conclusion orggos  to a new hope to perservere  and sucede. As a result, the reader is test with a sense of pleasure and a good feeling torwards the story. This conclusion show how Saeng is adapting to changes info and hope to enjoy her  new life in @LOCATION1.	3	3		3																					
3126	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a statement that Saeng vowed silently to herself. Saeng says she will take the test again referring to the drivers test. Seeing the geese flying in a �V� and seeing the hibiscus gave Saeng a sense of remembrance to her homeland. Saeng misses he homeland. The author wanted it to seem to the @CAPS1 as if Saeng is starting to feel at home again. The hibiscus is just a symbol to Saeng telling her that It will be @CAPS2.K, and that it�s okay for her to miss Vietnam but also that it�s okay to have a new life, So Saeng, in the spring, will go take her drivers test again with a new attitude and will pass the test.	2	2		2																					
3128	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph to tell you when Saeng was going to take the test again also ,to reunite with the plant again. This is a conclusion paragraph that gives insight on what will happen in the future that�s also why the author added this paragraph in.	0	0		0																					
3131	4	to show how absent she feels without them by her. You see this when the @ORGANIZATION1 says �when they come back�. also when she says �the geese return & this hibiscus is budding�. Shows how she feel without them and how she will feel when they return and how she will carry on where they left off last time as shown when she says �, Then I will take that test again�.	1	1		1																					
3132	4	I think it  was  a  good  enough  by Minfong Ho.Through out the story you feel somewhat happy,and somewhat sad,but always calm.You  feel happy when they are talking about all the  plants and when   her mother accepts the plants when she bought. At first, when you think  the mom is  going to yell at   her for buying that,after she failed her test.You feel bad for her but still calm mood and show the girl want give up,but just take her time.	1	2		2																					
3134	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself and to her mother too. Saeng decided to tell her mother what she had done, �she failed the test� probably her mom get upset with her but then she talk to her again. Saeng  mather�s ask her about the plant that she have with her. Saeng said that she buy the plant by @MONEY1. She was sad because she failed the test and when she buy the plant it probalbly makes her feel better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it bring some kind of hope to her, and she probably will pass the test. When she said �then I will take that test again� @CAPS1 makes her to decide to take it agan it could be the plant.	2	1		2																					
3135	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author want to show the readers that Saeng will want to pass her driver licens test. The reason that so the reader show how detirmen Saeng do after the winter The example is that in the story Saeng fail her driver licens and was sad about. The next example is that when she find this flow she know she do it again. This show that the flower help her feel better show that she will do it again. The first example show that she was sad that she fail the test. At the conclusion the author put this statement in the story to show reader tat Saeng will pass the diver licenc test later on.	1	2		2																					
3136	4	"In the story Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with Saeng saying �when they come back in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author chose to end the story this way to give it a positive ending. The rest of the story is and sad because saeng misses her home in Vietnam. ""Its � it�s not a real one. I mean, it�s not like the kind we had at � at � she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Not like the ones we had before."" The end sends the message that even though things are different than before, she won�t give up trying to make a good life in the United States and not let this change affect her "	2	2		2																					
3139	4	"The author concludes the story with ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silent ly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" because the girl is willing to try again and to not give up no matter what. The girl is upset because she doesnt have the real flower her mom had. ""It�s-it's not a real one,"" Saeng mumbled �i mean, not like the kind we had at- at."" She was upset and afraid that her mother was going to be angry with her that she started to shake. �I know,"" her mother said quietly. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. The author is just showing that the girl is going to try again next time."	1	2		2																					
3140	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph because he wants to get across to the reader that that saeng will not give up. Saeng and her family moved from Vietnam, and it has been hard for her to adjust to changes. Saeng really misses her homeland and the flowers that she sees @CAPS1 life. She explains how the winter hibiscus is not the same as the one in Vietnam so she plants this @CAPS1 type of flower and decides to wait till the spring to take the driving test. This shows that saeng wants to plant her difficulties in @LOCATION2 and think of them again in the spring when the weather and atmosphere is nice. She is not siving up but she does not want to take the difficulties till a later time. That is why the author concluded with this paragraph. 	3	2		3																					
3142	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph she did because it shows how Saeng is adapting with the change she is going through in @LOCATION1.the winter hibiscus helped her @CAPS1 with Failing her driving test, so Saeng figures it will give her luck when she takes it again. Also the hibiscus will survive, and while she works towards her goal it will develop more. Once the flower blooms, it will symbolize strength, helping Saeng over come this obstacle. Her mother said the flower was not as pretty but will survive. She means @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as great as Vietnam, but Saeng will stay strong.	2	2		2																					
3144	4	@PERSON1 go to the top and then over the hill.	0	0		0																					
3147	4	This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the atire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flower and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that save her the courage she needed to retake her driver�s test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, �when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...� At first the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story.	0	0		0																					
3148	4	The author concludes the story this way because in the winter time she wai�t be able to see the hibiscus .she is used to  going outside in the garden and seeing her beautiful plant In conclusion the author concludes the story that way, because in the winter time she wai�t see  her plant.  	0	0		0																					
3149	4	In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again.	2	1		2																					
3150	4	The author concludes the story with that like, to leave the reader guessing. The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve. The author was trying to show how she can change, and grow just like her plant.	2	2		2																					
3152	4	In winter hibiscus the teenager girl Saeng fails her driver�s test, and then runs into a winter hibiscus and comes in touch with her memories. The author concludes the story with re-trying the test when the geese return and hibiscus buds to show comfort & familiarity. When the speaker says �almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� This example shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature and that was what was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for  the reader because it took her for winter to discover this, and winter is when its too late,  the geese have left and the flower has closed, so when spring comes they�ll be open to new opportunities and so will she with the familarity around her. 	3	2		3																					
3154	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagein what rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example when the author said �then I will take that test again.� Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story. For example when the author said �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. Those were reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3155	4	The author concludes the story like this because when the snow is melting and the plant is buding and the geese come back then she will take the test again. This is a way for her to realy think when she is going to do this again. When they come back, so will she, to take the test over again.	1	1		1																					
3156	4	In the story Saeng vowed silently to herself, �When the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. For some reason I think that is affine idea Saeng vowed.	0	0		0																					
3157	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� probably chose to end the story that way because then it�s ending with a sense of hope. Also, it is showing how Saeng is adapting to her surroundings much like the winter hibiscus. In the second last paragraph, Saeng hears the hanks of the geese and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her through the course of the time Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because the time would allow her to grow and adapt even more. The hibiscus will be budding then, a sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adopting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could look to the plant for inspiration. This feeling of hope in Saeng and her future is left in the last paragraph, which is why the story ends there.	2	3		3																					
3162	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the story ends with that phrase to show that Saeng has goals. First, she wants to adapt to the new this new land. This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life. This also says she has precision, she will continue to try to get her license because she says, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She says that she will try again. Also, it exploits that she will get the courage to keep on trying and not give up."	2	2		2																					
3163	4	Saeng was waiting for spring then she could take the test again. I think at se was wereing about it doing spring because she whent to wacth the geese fly in a u shape and she whent to see the plant grow but the snow don�t melt yet. She started takeing to herself about it but she could whant to take at test doing spring. At if she can passed it again because she doesn�t like to take the test over and over again. When every body gets to the diffent thing after thee test is over.	1	1		1																					
3165	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is not giving up and she will take test agin and the stelent will grow agin in the @DATE1.	1	1		1																					
3166	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng is saying she is learning to adapt to this country. Earlier in the story she says that she failed the test, because she did not impress her mom. Saeng and her mom are used to ife in Vietnam, they trying to adapt. Saeng thought that the hibiscus she got Is just like the one she had at home. At the end she realizes if she just has faith everything will be @CAPS1 and it will be just like home. She says in the spring because by then her hibiscus will be fully growned and she will take the test again to see if the hibiscus is like the one her mother thought she would get. Saeng is learning to adapt to her new country of the United States.	2	2		2																					
3168	4	The girl is determend to win. She wen�t and took a test for a flower and she did not pass and she went back sad and emoshond she told her grandmother that these flowers are not like the ones at-at she cold not say at home because it took too much pain and her grandmother said they are not like the real wones.	1	1		1																					
3169	4	In this story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho , the author concludes the story with, �When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� In the beginning of the story that she was less confident and she failed the test.  But this one flower gave her hope and so next time she takes the test she�ll be better prepared. 	1	1		1																					
3175	4	I think that the author concludes with this paragraph bacuse she is determin to conpleat and pass the test. First reson way is that she faild this year and whants to pass next year. Next she is comparing the hibiscus to her passing and sulding on the test. That is way the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3176	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is going to try keep her next plant. The reason why she says she is going to take the test again because she sold the plant to somebody. Saeng has seed the plant before as a child and that's why she was so attached to it. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will try and keep her next plant. 	1	1		1																					
3178	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by: Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng is try to adjust to @LOCATION1 coming from Vietnam. She is sad and misses her home, especially after failing her drivers test. She walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home. She buys it and takes it home in a pot. She says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant. Her mother then comes and shares the moment with her. Saeng feels better now. In the end sentence the author includes �saeng vowed silently to her herself, in the spring when the snows melt� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�(Ho, ??)  the flower has given her the conbidence to socceed and she wants to take the test again. This shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain.	2	2		2																					
3180	4	I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it�s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she�ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus �comes back to life��. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she�ll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. So practically she�s stating once everything �come back to life� then she�ll feel like she will pass it next time. Now she can be prepared.	2	3		3																					
3185	4	The author concludes the story with he paragraph because they both go togather the away there both about things going and leaving the season changing. like they don�t won�t to let go but they knew there be back soon. Thats why the author combided the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3186	4	The author is expressing hope for the future in her concluding paragraph although just failing her drivers test and adjusting to a new atmoshere Saeng finds comfort in a Hibiscus. �it felt smooth an cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel.� This expresses that the rememberence of �an old friend� was able to lift her spirits after a previous dissappoinment it was obvious Saeng was uncomfortable in her environment, which her mother noticed when she arrived at home. �she paused as she noticed the tear stains on her a daughter�s cheecks and her puffy eyes.� Her daughter was not adjusting to her new atmosphere and even though she had spent a lot of money on a single flower she understood. With all the negative attitude through out the story, once Saeng saw the geese and planted her �winter� hibiscus, she realized what was strange to her before had now become familiar. Saeng finally realizes with a memory of home, her goals can be accomplished and life can be stable somewhere other than home. She illustrates that from failurecomes success.	2	3		3																					
3188	4	She is  saying that ryt now, is not the right time to table the tst, she is saying that she is going to wait to care back until spring, when the flowrs we blooming to take the test, @CAPS1 she is so acentric abought the exotic flowers, She can�t stand to do it now, when the time isn�t right. So she is saying that she is going to wait until the time is right to take the test.	0	0		0																					
3190	4	These are many reason why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3193	4	"The reason why the author concludes this paragraph is to show saeng that she will be waiting for them to grow back and she will try again for her test. Hibiscus means a lot to her, and will keep trying because she doesnt want her mother disappointed in her again. Example of wher saeng felt shame ""her mother stared at her incredulously. But how could you?"" saeng wants to not down herself or her mother. ""saeng vowed silently to herself"" saying a promise that she will pass and respect nature as well as elders"	1	1		1																					
3194	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� by minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is buddling , then I will take the test again,� @CAPS1 author concludes the story in this way because it is somewhat of a cliffhanger. In the story, @CAPS2 is upset about failing her driving test and she has just moved from Vietnam to the united states and so she is a little homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up ??? reminding being alike the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng hasn�t given up and that she is going  to try and pass the drivers license test again. But what you don�t know is the end result of whether she passes or not and so it is a cliffhaofer. That is why the author ended the story in this way.	2	2		2																					
3197	4	The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. �She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become� almost familiar now� that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions.	3	2		3																					
3198	4	I think that the author concludes the story she fails the driving test, so they added she was going to take it over. And maybe the plant is or would be good luck to her after the snow melts and the geese return it would be a fresh Start. Also it would be nice after she descovered the plant.	1	1		1																					
3200	4	He concludes that when it is spring he will take the test again. That will give her another chance to pass it. This will give her another chance to do what is right.	1	1		1																					
3201	4	She going to take the test agan @CAPS1 she feels like She needs to and She @CAPS2  when the snow melts and geese came back that means She wants to take the in the Spring. 	1	1		1																					
3202	4	"In �Winter Hibiscus� the author @CAPS1 sentence is �When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"".. I think the rememberence of home will help her take the test. She use to the geese and plant to remind her of home and by having these surroundings makes her comfortable"	1	1		1

She concudes it because the story is about then and their garden and it eventually turns cold leaving them nothing to do untill Spring. Itsuggest they have strong feelings For what they do as it says ""in In spring when the snow nelts and the gese return and this hibiscus budding"" hears she wants to take the tst to overcome and prove She can take care of her Garden."	0	0		0																					
3207	4	At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work. Instead  she rather garden then do school work.	0	0		0																					
3208	4	The author  concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus gave her some hope. Also , because her mother was understanding  about  her  failing the test. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph .	1	1		1																					
3209	4	The author concludes the story with optimism and hope for the future. She finishes her story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. By concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test. The hibiscus the helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before, through the quit repition of season upon season, almost femiliar to her now.�  In the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season.	3	2		3																					
3210	4	In the story,  @ORGANIZATION1, by  Minfong   Ho, a  girl  named  Saeng  tries  to  adjust  to  a  new country, but it is nearly impossible. She is stressed about failing the driver�s test, country, but it is and she realizes that  nothing is  the same. Except for  one thing  that  she  quickly  recognized. A  plant called the �Winter Hibiscus.�It made her think of her old life in Vietnam. It helped her  set  through  hard  times  and she didn�t want to give up on anythings.This is exactly why Minfong Ho ends the  last paragraph  by stating  that Saeng  will retry  the driving test when the hibiscus is budding.The  flower gives her a thought of home   in  Vietnam, making her try and try again.Also,the author  ends the  story  like   this  to  state a  theme. This particular  theme  is,  �No matter  how hard something  might  be, you can get through it. You  just  have  to  find  a way that benefits you most.�	2	2		2																					
3213	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I think the ending paragraph is there to show that Saeng has not given up. She says, �When they come back�then I will take that test again.� She is talking about the hibiscus and the geese. The things that remind her of home. When the reminders of home come and give her strength, she will have the power to take the test. This shows that even though she has failed she will not give up and she will try again. I think that is the purpose of the paragraph. To show Saeng hasn't given up.  	2	2		2																					
3217	4	The author concludes this story by saying this statement because the author want you to feel like the character in the book is determined. The ator is trying to put across a statement saying  get through then try again. The character is not giving up, and she will get through the test eve though its hard.	1	1		1																					
3220	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show determination and hope. The geese and the  hibiscus symbolize saeng�s determination, because they always come back no matter what. Saeng will be back to take the test , just like the geese will also be back. The hibiscus also symbolize her because it has faced adversity also. It has been taken to new paces and had new homes, much like saeng , and has a harsh winter coming in the near future.  However , it  always  finds a way to come back and bloom in the spring, which is what saeng hopes to do by taking the driver�s test. The author included the last paragraph to show symbolism between saeng  ,the  geese , and the hibiscus.That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.    	3	3		3																					
3221	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he basicly trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might mean through seasons. She @MONTH1 think that she would have better on her test in the spring only for the simply fact that everything blooms in the spring.	1	1		1																					
3223	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in th spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph is that what happens to his life that he will take the test again. But in the story it talks about. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it So I think that they take care of there garden and try to make it live in the winter. So thats what I think about the last paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	1	1		1																					
3224	4	"The author concludes the story with this because that one paragraph basically sums the whole story up. ""When the snow melts and the geese return"" basically goes back to the beginning of the story when saeng started planting. This is why the author gave the story ends conclusion."	0	0		0																					
3226	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" at the end of the story the author writes ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again."" The reason why the author said that Is because she Is trying to tell the readers to get right back up and do it again, If you fell once there Is no harm and trying again. When its spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promise to take the drive's test. After failing a driver test Saeng buys a flower at a florIst that remInded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and put it in the garden. Told her mother that she fail, Saeng's mother was very understand and told her maybe next time In conclusion the author �write the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life.  "	1	2		2																					
3227	4	The author concludes the story that way so she can keep everyone wondering. I belive she ended that way to let us know that she will be back and when she comes back she will be ready for everything including that test. She left us wondering because when she does come back she is going to want use to Read about what happened when she came back and what happened when she @CAPS1 the test. She only made that vowe to herself nobody else because if she did she would have let them down if she failed. That is why she concludes the story that way.	2	3		3																					
3228	4	The author ends the story with this because she is saying she will be around next year to take the test again. She is saying how she wants to be around when the plants grow. She mostly wants to see the hibiscus grow. Because she appreciates and likes nature so much she wants to be around again to see them grow.	0	0		0																					
3230	4	"When they  come back, Saeng vowed to silently herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and  this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concluded this story in such a way that it makes the reader ask questions much live in the �@CAPS1�s @ORGANIZATION1� when there was a modernist way to interprentle means of a sty by makeing the reader ask questions instead of that beig a moral to the story. For example in the �@CAPS1�s @ORGANIZATION1"" the main character @PERSON1 run away and all are could get as a slaming door. Much live in this story there is a twist in that what test is the main character talking about? Is she goig to try to move ww friends? is this live a resolution she is making to herself? also this leaves the reader wanting more of the story so that they @MONTH1 go back and even read it again."	1	1		1																					
3231	4	The �Winter Hibiscus� is a realativly sad, but hopeful story that uses lots of symbols. The author concluded the story with a confident ending that makes the reader feel satisfied. The two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring. �Winter Hibiscus� ends with a hopeful tone thanks to the confident vow Saeng silently makes. She had a rough day, and the author wanted to make sure she had something to look as a goal. It also reveals how strong of a person Saeng is. The author uses this conclusion paragraph to leave the reader with a hopeful and confident tone. The second reason the author concluded with that conclusion paragraph was to relate some of the objects she sees to the spring. The geese represent the new place she is living in, and the hibiscus represents her old home. This paragraph links these two symbols together, so the reader can relate them to the spring. The way the author concluded the story was brillantly done. It represents a hopeful tone, and symbols that relate to spring. It ends confidently, and leaves the reader satisfied.  	2	3		3																					
3232	4	I think author concludes the with this paragraph because she wants to not give up. For example, he wants to show  us never give up at anything even if you fail. Therefore, that�s why he ends like that.	1	1		1																					
3233	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted to get her point across. also because she wanted to create an under standing of the complexitier of the passage. The author wanted the reader to feel her message as if they were there to witness it.	0	0		0																					
3236	4	The author of �winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with �when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.�Saeng, because it creates the mood that Saeng is accepting the changes. Just like nature adapts to climate and location change, saeng seems to appreciate her situation and is deciding her situation and is deciding to make it a positive instead of a negative. The author is showing that if your having trouble, try again; through the main character, Saeng.	2	2		2																					
3238	4	Minfong Ho concluded �Winter Hibiscus� with the lines �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� to show that there is always hope for better things to come. Saeng had become sad because she remembered her home in Vietnam. She longed for her natural home and familiarity. Her missed memories agonizingly hurt Saeng because she was now for away and in a different world. However, the author started to reveal hints that @ORGANIZATION1 would accept @LOCATION2 and find come childhood memories there too. �Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and �yes- familiar to Saeng now.� Already, Saeng was growing familiar with her surrounding area in @LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would keep her @CAPS1 culture, tradition, and memories alive, as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in @LOCATION2. As one kept her @CAPS1 and �@CAPS3 culture alive through memories, she would continue a successful life and pass her test. That is why Minfong Ho ended �Winter Hibiscus� with the particular paragraph.	3	2		3																					
3240	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready. The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.	2	2		2																					
3241	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes the change in Saeng as well as other things. The snow always melts when the seasons change. The geese always come back when the seasons change. The hibiscus will bud when the seasons change. Saeng will try again when the seasons change. But she�ll be a different person also. Knowing that everything will change but stay the same on the inside, Saeng decides she will too. She has more of an appreciation for @CAPS1 now after seeing the hibiscus and remembering her past.	1	2		2																					
3243	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring it�s warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.	0	0		0																					
3244	4	The author concude the story with that paragraph because its what she solemely promoted herself.	0	0		0																					
3253	4	I think he means thas seasons change and that winter will come again. I think that is the test. 	0	0		0																					
3257	4	I think the author concludes the story with the phase �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� I there saying that they will be ready for them the next time they come back.	0	0		0																					
3264	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she�s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here. She�s said  and does lots of fun things.	0	0		0																					
3265	4	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese that flew down south in a beautiful @CAPS1 formation, fly down every season. So she tells herself, @CAPS2, she will take the test again when the geese return and the hibiscus plant is budding. For example, she thinks to herself, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� @CAPS2, looking up at the geese she is almost reminded of an experience she went through somewhat similar.	1	1		1																					
3267	4	She can�t wait till the flowers start to come back when the snow melts so it isn�t very cold out so they grow and she is going to take her test that she has failed when the geese and flowers come back.	1	1		1																					
3268	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng, like the geese and the hibiscus, will return again and have hope. Saeng is a little depressed in the story because she is in a new country, and just failed her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back painful emotional memories for her, but at the same time, s very comforting. Later in the story, she plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother. As her mother goes inside, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead. �Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Like the geese.� Saeng knew the geese would return in the spring, just like she would to her driving test. The hibiscus would be in bloom again too to provide her with hope. This is what the final paragraph in the story �winter hibiscus� means.	3	2		3																					
3269	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng�s everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng�s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace.	1	2		2																					
3270	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she�ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that �many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.� And when she�s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  	3	3		3																					
3273	4	This paragraph is a good way to end the story because it relates to the test. The narrator says she will try again in the spring. 	1	1		1																					
3274	4	I believe that the author  concludes the story with this paragraph because it's what the story is all about it just exploins what happened in the end as if what happeed through the story was the growth and living of a flower.	0	0		0																					
3276	4	The author concludes the story by showing the girl�s connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese, the �Winter hibiscus� is her connection to her homeland. She said she�ll retake her driving test when her plant buds and is brave, so she will do the same. The geese flying south show her journey as a person because she will take the test when the geese come back from their journey, as she comes back from hers.	2	2		2																					
3283	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver�s test. �She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. �This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she�ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2.	2	2		2																					
3285	4	"In the story Winter Hibiscus written by @CAPS1 Ho. The narrarator goes to a greenhouse that has many flowers but one in perticular catches her eye. A ''winter'' Hibiscus plant. This plant reminds her of her homeland and everything that used to take place there this plant also reminds her of  her grandmother's long silkly gray hair and how she used to watch her dry it in the sun and then she would help her knot it up into a ton with a bud of this plant in it. The author ends the story with this because it counters her statement when she say ""I-I failed the test."" and the end of this passage  says  ""..., then I will take the test again""."	1	2		2																					
3286	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the girl Saeng @CAPS1 the drivers test ""I-I failed the test"" said Saeng. She had bought a hibiscus because the flower remined her of some of the memories from home and the hibiscus she had at herhouse. at the end she says that she will retake the test when the geese come back, the snow has melted and the hibiscus is budding. She does this I think because she needs time to just think things through to just remember back home and to make a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is just like Saeng. They both did something wrong or @CAPS1 something Saeng failed the test and the hibiscus was constrited to a pot. But they both are going to change the bad thing.."	1	2		2																					
3289	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended her story with words regarding to the story @CAPS1 failed her driving test. Saeng cried when noticing her past through flower. As well as bought dok malik seeds show that the story ended the way it did, because next season	1	1		1																					
3290	4	 The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up.	1	1		1																					
3294	4	This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, �She lifted her head.� This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, �when the snow melts and the geese return,� this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, �and this hibiscus budding� she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it�s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring.	2	3		3																					
3295	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of reasons.	0	0		0																					
3297	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because he wants the emphasize that the girl is not completly dissatisified with leaving her home. He ended with that because he wanted to she that their is hope for her to learn to love her new home.	1	1		1																					
3299	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. The next time it blooms the girl will be ready for the test and will take it again and will pass. The authour  wants to show that the girl will not give up and will try again to make sure she passes. The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test.	1	2		2																					
3301	4	"The author ends the story like that to show the theme working hard, Some other examples of working hard are the �winter hibiscus."" Another example is her vow to pass the test, so that is why the author ends the story that way."	1	1		1																					
3303	4	Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these tequniques a story @MONTH1 seem bland average or unattractive. Author Minfong Ho canverys the fact that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of simply stating the fact that she will retake the test, he has her make a promise on the geese that she will. The Author ended the story like this show how strongly she felt about the test.	0	0		0																					
3304	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it connects the hibiscus back to the trials and triumphs of saeng . Just how saeng can�t give up .and must go back to retake the test, the winter hibiscus must make it through the hard, rough winter and come back strong . The hibiscus are a symbol of hope and saeng thinks of them as her hope. Throughout the story, the hibiscus are comforting to saeng because they remind her of home. The author includes this because many people can relate to this and find hope in things.  For saeng, knowing that each year the hibiscus will come back in those conditions, reassures her that she�ll be okay there as well.	2	2		2																					
3306	4	I think the author concludes this story wit this ending paragraph because the story is all about how  she feels comforted in the plants and she wants to wait until the weather breaks and the geese to come back to take her test. I think she wants to wait that way she will be more comfortable with her surroundings and she can clear her mind and do her best on the test.	1	1		1																					
3307	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back� and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."	1	1		1																					
3311	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng relates the hibiscus overcoming of problems to her own overcoming of problems. Saeng is comparing the hibiscus to herself. If the hibiscus can adapt to its surroundings, then so can she. And if the hibiscus makes it through the winter, then she too can make it; and she will re-take the test that she failed before. Also, before this she says that things that were once strange to her now seemed familiar, like the geese. She then see�s them overhead flying in a V. They are also adapting to their surroundings by flying to a warmer place, and Saeng too can adapt.	2	2		2																					
3312	4	The author Concludes the story with that sentence, because She is excited for spring to come back So she can plant more things and watch them bloom, and come alive.	0	0		0																					
3313	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because it shows Saeng will not give up. Saeng failed her drivers test and as she was walking home she found a hibiscus. It reminder her of her old home. Saeng goes to the green house or flowershop and buys one. When she returns she plants the hibiscus. The hibiscus is keeping her from giving up. When it starts budding, @PERSON1 will take the test again.	2	1		2																					
3315	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because It makes people want to read the next story to see How she close on a the test. In the story she failed the test now that she changed she wants to retake the test because she knows she can do @PERSON1 now than before.	1	1		1																					
3318	4	The reason why they include the story with the paragraph is because they talk about the same thing. Then they probably included the story with the paragraph might have been to show the good relationship between the mother and daughter and how they can do things together. Then in the story they talk about going to Canada together.	0	0		0																					
3322	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because he is showing that she will not give up and she will do it when she is ready to. The reason I say this is because she is doing the test when she wants to, when she feels comfortable. Those are the reasons I belive that the author ended the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3327	4	I think the author ended the story like that because she enjoys to see the geese and she loves the spring and wants to take the test and pass. Sh is studying for it in the mean time.	1	1		1																					
3328	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do.	1	1		1																					
3330	4	He concludes the story like thot because the test was the main thing thot he was talking about.	0	0		0																					
3332	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown. She has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too. nature�s fight for survival is like Saeng�s struggle in a new place. She discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time. Then after that time it will feel just like home. The adaption principle is shown throughout this story demonstrate by nature or a child�s life it�s there. Therefore the author would agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng.	3	2		3																					
3338	4	In the story the author concludes that after shes done her test and there's nothing that to see she'll grow more.	0	0		0																					
3341	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus is a reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong and she compares herself to the geese saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter the hibiscus doesn�t bloom and Saeng fails her driver�s test. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the Hibiscus thrives and the geese return it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well.   	2	2		2																					
3343	4	The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample �But it�s strong enough to make it through winter�, says her mother. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself �Then i will take the test again.�     	2	2		2																					
3346	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years.	1	1		1																					
3347	4	I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Now tell that wasn�t beautiful.	0	0		0																					
3349	4	He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants.	1	2		2																					
3350	4	In the story winter Hibiscus they end the story with that paragaph, because it repents that she is geting use to the new contrury. She is also telling you that you need to a paped to newsra winds. That�s why I think they ened with that pargraph	1	1		1																					
3352	4	The author concludes with that because she kind of relates herself to the flowers. She has grown to her environment like a flower. Also she had failed her test, so just like when a flower dies and then comes back, she is going to come back and try the test again.	2	1		2																					
3353	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she failed the test so over the winter they don�t get hibiscus but over the spring when they get again the hibiscus she will try to take the taste again so she can pass it	1	1		1																					
3356	4	The last paragraph in, ��Winter Hibiscus,�� was add because the author want to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test. She feels disapointed because her mom is disapointed in her and knows she can pass it. While she stares at the Hibiscus then the geese flying in the air, she thinks that she does have a chance in passing the test. Now that she is determined to take the test, she is going to take it at the same time in the next year and she believes she is going to pass it.    	2	1		2																					
3357	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that�s how the girl feel. She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did.	1	1		1																					
3358	4	It means that she want to do it all over again. It the girl comfort zone - So that is what she does when she upset. That is what the story and the phase mean.	0	0		0																					
3359	4	"The author concluded ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to tell the reader never give up and to keep trying. It also tells us that family is always there because you can't do it on your own. ""It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng- noi"", she finally said"	1	1		1																					
3363	4	Saeng is trying to say that when the time comes again that she will take the test. The author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test. The auther also does this to show that you should never quit like if the flower can survive winter then she will be able to survive that test. Also the author is saying that when the seasons change, things change. She was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence. Also she cherished the plant because she wants to see it budding because her and her mother spent quality time dve to this plant she had.	2	1		2																					
3371	4	The Author concludes the story with Saeng saying a vow silently to herself to show the reader that she will grow like the hibiscus plant and take the test again, this time determined to pass it. The plant gives Saeng hope because it reminds her of the homeland that she loved so much. When the hibiscus starts budding and gaining beautiful flowers, Saeng will �bud� too and gain her license.	1	1		1																					
3374	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She could want the people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start up again so will Saeng. Ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and geese restarts their lives Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but instead re-take the test. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves you thinking so then the sequel will be about the start of Saeng�s new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 love having people wonder about whats coming next. The people will go home and wonder what will the author do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer.	2	2		2																					
3376	4	The author concluded the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to portray to her reader that even though Saeng was experiencing a hardship leaving her old home behind, she could still find a good life with new beginning here. In the final paragraph the winter shows represent hard times in the past, while the spring represents a more optimistic future, and a new beginning. Although Saeng was grieving at the lass of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story she once knew hibiscus cran her did home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home. Also, the story says.� Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This quote leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can appreciate happly live in this new home. The final paragraph says,�.. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.� When things familiar to her and things their remind her of her old home come back, Saeng will have the strength to try to accomplish good things for this new life in a new home again.	3	3		3																					
3383	4	The author concludes the story with this because its winter now + the flowers are gone, but during that time when she was planting she grew more mature. like it says in the text things she used to think were strange are now becoming firmiliar + shes getting the hang of things. Because shes learning more about it + will be ready for the test next spring. 	1	2		2																					
3385	4	The ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story. It is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader. In the end of the story Winter Hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement. The conclusion encourages you to keep trying, because it states that next year when the flower blooms Saeng will re-take the test. This shows encouragement because has the drive to try again and to pass. The author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is strong and also seems to recap the stories meaning because all along Saeng keeps getting disapointed about the flower, her mother, and homeland encourage her to move on and try again. The ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was truly trying to convey	2	1		2																					
3387	4	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph about geese to show that Saeng is going to try to overcome her obstacles. She was @CAPS1 disappointed in failing the test so she took comfort in memories of her homeland. She bought a hibiscus that she saw in her homeland a lot, and that flower @CAPS2 comfort and affection. But it also @CAPS2 her ability to come over obstacles, and while she was planting her hibiscus, and saw the geese flying above, she knew she had to try again.	2	1		2																					
3389	4	The author concludes the paragraph when Saeng realizes she can miss her old home, but she needs to adapt to the new place that she is in. Saeng misses the old memories of her homeland �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.� But, she begins to realize that not everything has changed, same things are still familiar. �overhead, a flock of canada geese flew by, the faint honrs clears and �yes- familiar to Saeng now.� When Saeng realizes that not everything has changed she gained the strength to continue her new life in her new country.	2	2		2																					
3390	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it was a good way to end the story off. At the end of this they was talkin about how saeng would come back when the snow melt and then she will take the test again.	0	0		0																					
3391	4	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding; then I will take that test again. The author concludes this story Winter Hibiscus with this paragraph because in the story it's about Saeng and she fails her drivers test, and notice a familiar plant which causes her to go to a florist shop. As Saeng learns about this familian plant it encourages her to retake that drivers test, to where as though the snow is gone and the sun is shining.	1	1		1																					
10535	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say in the spring when the snow goes away and the hibiscus start growing she will test the plant again       	0	0		0																					
10536	4	""The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng still has hope to succeed and adapt in this new country. She previously had a lot of home sickness, missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her child hood. The height of her homesickness is seen when Saeng comes back to her house and is explaining to her mother the nature of the hibiscus. �She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� Saeng is uncomfortable living in @LOCATION1 and wishes to go back to Vietnam. Butt by the end, Saeng�s attitude changes from despair to hope. Even though she has failed her driver�s test. Saeng is determined and hopeful to do at least something in this new country by saying ""...then I will take the test again.� Saeng has changed a good deal within this story and that change in attitude is seen with the exerpt on geese in the last paragraph."	3	2		3																					
3395	4	"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to illustrate the oevrall message of the story. That paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles. Saeng is coming from another country and is facing challenges not only in the garden, but in her life as well. She had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, by saying ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� she truly shows her determination and how shes not afraid to overcome obstacles that will face her. "	2	2		2																					
3396	4	The author of this story concluding this story this way because instead opsorbing all the pain she can look in to the future. Aso by looking in to the future she can forget about the past and try better in the future.	1	1		1																					
3401	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus when Saeng says that she will take the test again in the spring, so she can walk home and see the flower that she found. Also in the story it mentions that in her past childhood she had seen the same flower in her country, but the next time she takes the driving test she would like to pass. It shows that she was disapointed because in the story it say that she paid over nineteen dollars for the test. Her mother was astionished, and yelled at her for a second. Saeng began crying and her mother calmed to show sympathy for her. Now she has the determination to take the test again. 	1	1		1																					
3402	4	"Minfong Ho, the author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" ended her story with @ORGANIZATION1 thinking about the spring because she wanted to make @ORGANIZATION1's future more hopeful. The character @ORGANIZATION1 seemed depressed and always reminiscient of her past in Vietnam. When she sees the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers she ""brokedown and wept"", and she remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells the Jasmine. To make maTters worse for Saeng she failed her driving test, which is something that most teens find as a big disappointment. By this point in the story I felt sorry for @ORGANIZATION1 and I wonderd if things would get better for her because she was away from everything she knew and loved with just some memories and a winter hibiscus unlike the kind she had back at her name in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, @ORGANIZATION1 suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.�    "	2	3		3																					
3403	4	The concluding paragraph to the story �Winter Hibiscus� gives a sense of hope for the future. The girl, Saeng, has just failed her test and is feeling depressed. Through a series of event�s, her depression leaves her and she feels hope.�Then I will take that test again.� This final sentence shows Saeng�s determination. She was upset about leaving her home and she was upset about failing her test, but thanks to a flower, she got her confidence back. Whenever someone is upset it is easy to give up. Until the final paragraph, the tone in the story is depressing. When the author put in the conclusion, it was like a light at the end of a dark tunnel. The author is saying that even when things are hard and seem impossible, something will be the to lift your spirits. There is always a posative in negatave situation, you just have to look for it. 	2	2		2																					
3404	4	In guessing that it means that when winter or spring or whatever its harder to grow that garden. Also mabe its a challenge of some sort to make the garden grow by that time of year. So I would assume thats what its talking about with it.	1	1		1																					
3406	4	To me I would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons. To explain it could mean new begining or starting over. For example, when the geese fly away and came back, that means that the @CAPS1 are changeing. So with that being said, the @CAPS1 changing or starting over could represent his chance to take test can start over, and he will get another chance.  	2	1		2																					
3408	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows you can over come something if you have the will power. Saeng failed the first test. She bought a plant that reminds her of home. She planted the plant despite the cold, hard ground. She realized the once strange things were now part of her everyday life. She decided to retake the test. Saeng realized that even though you @MONTH1 fail once you have to keep trying if it is what you believe in. She also realized that she will never forget her home but she still can move on. Finally Saeng realized that good things can over come bad. After she failed the test she bought the flower. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it summerizes the story perfectly.	2	2		2																					
3410	4	The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng.	2	2		2																					
3411	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how Saeng was Not going to give up. Throughout the story she had been feeling down. From when she failed the test and she misses Vietnam. So many things throughout where she and her mother lives reminds her of Vietnam. �She closed her eyes and breathed. in, deeply Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long gray hair....� This made her very imotional, to see how many things reminded her of Vietnam. The author ended like this to show how the experience of all this affected her.	1	1		1																					
3413	4	The author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement. �When the geese come back � in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.� This statement shows renewal and persistance. I think she added this because after realizing the plant can come back time and time again, even after the harsh weather, she knew she could do it too. She vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew  herself and get back on track. It conveys persistance also. The plant doesn�t die each season. It�s hardy and comes back. If the girl can be persistant and come back next year to retake the test, she will be considered persistant. I think the girl wants to be just like flower. She sees it as being indomitable, renewing and beautiful. No matter where the plant is being grown, it will always keep those traits.	2	2		2																					
3414	4	The reason for the author concluding the following is because she wants it to be known to the readers that saeng is not going to just give up because she fails it the first time. That she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make a effort. It states that saeng will retake the test again in the spring when the snow has done melted and geese returns and this hibiscus is budding. Not only was the hibiscus an important part to the story, it was a very important part to her life it help her move on a see how things change cause over time it will chage and develop and adapt to the changes around it. Yes it was a disappointment to her mother but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home. It might comforted her in a way. There was many different things probably going on where she was she missed the test it wasn�t home. She has to adjust and adapt to the situation that she is in. 	2	3		3																					
3416	4	Next year around the winter time when she she have to plant things again she is going to be ready and this time she gone do it much better.	1	1		1																					
3417	4	The author included this because she was showing that it was winter and the flower was goin to bloom and the geese were flying here because it is cold. Also the author said that because the story title is called the �Winter Hibiscus� which obviously blooms in the winter so that is why I think the author said what she did.	0	0		0																					
3418	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with a sentence stating that when Saeng�s Hibiscus� first bud appears in the spring she will be back to take drivers test. The author might have decided to conclude the story like that because what if the plant died, would she go back and take the test? The author was probably just wanting the reader to think hard about it. In conclusion, the author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� might have concluded his story to make it somewhat suspenseful.	1	1		1																					
3419	4	The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, �Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world� (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her �(Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus other things will make her ready for the test also. The story says, �It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center � just as she had known it would feel� (Ho).The feel of the hibiscus @MONTH1 remind Saeng of distsnt memories, like helping her grandmother with her hair. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test she will not fail.	2	3		3																					
3427	4	The author concludes her story with the quote, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� because the author  is showing that nature and the plant are valuable to her. Saeng (who says the quote) believes that the hibiscus will help her pass the test. Earlier on in the story it shows that when she gets in trouble, she rubs the plant leaves in her hands to help her overcome the problem. The author is making the idea clear and portraying the idea that the plant helps Saeng with obstacles.	1	2		2																					
3429	4	The author includes this in the paragraph to simply be sarcastic for you to know that it is almost impossible for Saeng to take the test afresh. I say this because she was being very sarcastic meaning she�s not going to take the test. For example, if someone were to tell me take a test and I said whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then I�ll take the test. That would be very sarcastic meaning that it wont happen and I�m not taking the test, instead of just saying No. The author included that just to let you know that the chances of her taking the test is very low.   	0	0		0																					
3430	4	The author includes this paragraph inorder to show an end to the story and to  show that Saeng has not given up. Ho wanted to show how the plant and the geese represented the continueation of Saeng�s life in the United States. The geese will come back and the Hibiscus will bud and flower, and Saeng will retake and  hopefoly pass her diving test. This paragraph is not just a colosing but a new beginging of life for geasse, a Winter Hibiscus, and Saeng.	1	2		2																					
3431	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show @CAPS1 strength and encouragement. When she�s willing and able she will take the test again with more confidence. Saeng says this to herself to help her get through until she can drive. She�s saying by next spring she�ll take her test. By next spring she�ll be able to drive. By next spring she�ll be used to her new home. This paragraph tells that it takes time to do things you don�t always get it right away so keep trying.	2	2		2																					
3432	4	In my opinion the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was feeling down about not passing her driving test but when she saw those flowers she realize when she came to @CAPS1 she  forget all about her home town. So she decied to get back in touch with a nature side and hold off taking her test intill the spring instead of rushing things.	1	1		1																					
3433	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to that she still has hope of finding home and being happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. So when the plant budds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy, that is when she will take the driving test. Also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting acustomed to the new home and lifestyle, �A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks deer and�yes�familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.� Through these examples I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show Saeng assimilation into her new lifestyle, and her acception of her situation.	3	2		3																					
3435	4	"At the end of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story through stating, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author ends the story in such a way in order to reveal the hope that lies in Saeng's future. After failing her drivers's test, Saeng returns home with disappointment and sadness. This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck will change. The reader is left with a hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is @CAPS1. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United states instead of her home. Her success in fitting in with her new life is shown when through the quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before. had become... almost familiar"". Truly Saeng is a determined character."	2	3		3																					
3436	4	The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next @DATE1. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3437	4	The author is letting us /reader know that the give plans to do the same thing again next year when the show is  all gone, when the geese come back and when etcs  warm enough for the hibiscus flower to bud/bloom again! the author @MONTH1 also be concluding the sentence to show that this is the life the little give chose and she will keep up with new gardening till the next spring!	0	0		0																					
3438	4	Saeng concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows what she has just been through and feels she could go through it again. If she fails the driving test again, then she use the plants to overcome her problems. She @MONTH1 actually pass the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and believes now that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood.	1	1		1																					
3439	4	She shows that she loves her grandmother and she loves what they do like gardening and stuff like that. Her mother cares about her but she is really striction  her.	0	0		0																					
3440	4	The author concluded the story in such a way that the reader�s eyes are opened. It shows the reader that dispite what @MONTH1 happen, how bad things seem, and how hopeless you feel, there�s always a way to make it better. Saeng failed her test, was in a new land, and had lost her grandmother, but still planned to try again. like the waves on the shore, they will always try to wash away the sand by coming back again. just like these waves, Saeng is willing to try again, as should we all.	1	1		1																					
3441	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that season is over and a new season is starting.	0	0		0																					
3442	4	"The author concludes the story with  ""when they comes back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese reture and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. This quote meaning that once the flower buds she will take the test over again because saeng will have the courage & the will to do it knowing she will pass it. The flower represents something to her that gives her motivation and determination. Everyone has something that modilates them in life to keep them going & saeng has her plant. The author kind of gives you direction & idea where the story going to go also when the flower buds."	2	1		2																					
3446	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver�s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (��and this hibiscus is budding��), the author depicts Saeng�s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver�s test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng�s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng�s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (��when the snow melts and the geese return��). This shows Saeng�s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes.	3	3		3																					
3448	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they com back, saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 then she will become more familiar. For example, the author says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become , through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her now.� That tells me that she feels that over same time , she will become more familiar with driving and then she will take the test again. Then she @MONTH1 pass it	1	1		1																					
3452	4	Ii think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause the author is saying Its gonna be a @CAPS1 year or some change is gonna happen and he feels That could of did better than what they did and is gonna take that test again.	1	1		1																					
3456	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, �It�s flowers aren�t pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. �It shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repition of season upon season�� It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that she�s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be strong and follow the flow of life.	2	1		2																					
3465	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because when the snow melts and the geese return, she going to have higher confidence in taking and passing the test. After she failed the test later on in the story the geeses had flew away. So when the geese return the geese will remind her of what had just now happened. When the snow melts and spring comes the hibiscus flower will bloom once again.	1	1		1																					
3466	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� in the spring come back the new hopes ,comfort belive, As  she said in the story �in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again.� She hear when the hibiscus comes back brings new hopes to the life to take that test for. Here the hibiscus mean  hope. Second of all when she said �the geese return and this hibiscus is budding � she  means that is comfort for her it strong than hope and more if her mom helps her blue in her  self because is not easy to do it without her mom comfort. Lastly she said�Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and yes familiar to saeng  now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of a strange before had became, through the quiet repetitions of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� She mean that the season is coming and the hibiscus  grow she will regain the blive  and the strength that she need to have to take the test the hibiscus means a lot to her means vew  hopes ,comfort, and belive.	2	3		3																					
3467	4	"Coming back from failing her driving test, Saeng is comforted by finding the hibiscus flower. It brings back cherished @CAPS1 about Saeng's homeland, because it is very similar to flowers that grew by her old home. The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. In Saeng's mind , if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she."	2	2		2																					
3469	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotion connection to the memories and flashbacks that the Hibiscus brings back to her. At one point in the story, she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back aware of memories. Later on in the story, she takes the plant to her mother. At first @PERSON1 is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughter�s actions and feelings. Saeng is upset that she didn�t pass her test and her mother understands that. I think the author ends the story this way because wants the reader to see that because the hibiscuses is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, she will have a reason and motivation to continue and reach her goal of passing.	2	2		2																					
3471	4	The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well.	0	0		0
