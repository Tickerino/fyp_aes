4	2	In the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you. Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make.     Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION1, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our @CAPS1 as the first ten admendments to the @CAPS1. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the @CAPS1 and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the @LOCATION1. By violating the @CAPS1 openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the @CAPS1. The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the @CAPS1 as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the @CAPS1, the @LOCATION1 is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society.     The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society. Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the @CAPS8 public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society. Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that they were when the censorship began.     Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel '@CAPS9 @NUM1' by @PERSON1, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed. The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out @CAPS10 @CAPS11 or the @CAPS12. By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all intrest in higher learning. That is why censorsip can quickly lead to the collapse of a society.     Although censorship @MONTH1 seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is. Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1. So let us hope that all though we @MONTH1 play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to no where	0			5																					
9	2	Does censorship really helf or setback our libraries? Does it try to mask @CAPS7 really might be happening in this world or does it try to make you feel all happy about this horrendous place that you live in? To one person a book could be very offensive and to their neighbor it could have a whole new, opposite meaning. Its all in perspective.     Personally, i think that taking out some of the 'offensive' book in libraries could be a diaster. In one book that we read this year in my @CAPS1 class was '@CAPS2 @NUM1'. This book was all about a distopia where people burnt books who didn't send the right message to society. People were numb to feelings and that could be the outcome of censorship in the libraries around the @LOCATION1. Libraries are a place that sparks imangination for all ages and if you censor things out then how is that suppose to happen?     Looking at books in the past that were defied as 'offensive' and taken off of the shelves at libraries and banned to read in @CAPS1 class at school, were mostly about womens rights and @CAPS3 @CAPS4. Some of then just had bad words in them and others about dystopias. If you took out all af those books that pertained to these topics how many books would you ave left? And for that matter, my best friend is an @CAPS3 @CAPS6 girl and we both have equal rights now and we both have jobs so @CAPS7 is the big deal with living in the past? Theres is also the fact that it is innevitable to get away from cursing everywhere you go. All along the streets, in schools and sometimes even in church. So if you are around it in real life then why can't you read about it?     Now when people who are all for the cenorship in libraries say something to the affect of ' @CAPS7 about the children, i dont want them reading a book that i think is offensive,' i say then cenor them. Its your own choice on how you raise your kids but other parents think that you should have an imagination instead of the same old, same old. Its good to have a varity of things to read that doesn't limit the brain.      All in all, i think people who would want to censor books are crazy and it could potentually be taken way out of hand and then a distpoia society would form. Children should not be dissillusioned on @CAPS7 the world is and could be. Think about that next time that you think a book could arise tension between people and think are you taking away rights of other	2			2.5																					
14	2	If i had the right to remove books, music, magazines or other things that were offensive from a library i wouldn't do it. I wouldn't do it because everybody as a right to read, lisen and see whatever they want. If people really didn't want to see offensive books or anything else why would they be seeing it in the first place. Some parents think that they shouldn't have offensive books beacuse it would affect their children.Their would be a change in kids education.     Everybody has the right to read whatever they want. Their are different kinds of people that like to read different kinds of things. If books would have to be remove from the library then everybody would start taking all the books out. One way or another evrybody ends up reading all those offensive books at a certain point of their lifes anyways.     The parents that are so worried about what their kids would see at a library should inform themselves of what their kids are reading and prohibid them from doing it. In my opinion I think that if parents took the time to explains their kids the good and bad things about life it wouldn't be that offensive for their children.     Another reason of why i wouldn't remove books from a library is because it would affect the education of many kids. Removing books means taking away history from them. There are many painters in our history that painted naked womans many people find that offensive. I think they should never take that history from them beacuse they are just learning things about their history.     Books, music, magazines, ect should not be remove from libraries. Because those things are important for everybody whether you read or not. Removing this items would just be a total chaos. They should leave the libraries just the way they are. Everybody has the right to read, lisen and see whatever they want.	6			0																					
19	2	There are some certain materials i think is affensive to childrens is book,music,movies an even magazines.Books have a lot of materials unsafe for children because they can get a hold to @CAPS1 books and other unsafe materials.Another thing is music, and even music videos has a lot of profanity in them.Movies such as @CAPS1 movies some children @MONTH1 watch them and reflect wat they have watched on tv.The next thing is magazines,has material such as appropreate pictures in them tats why they should take the books,music,movies and magazines off the shelf.	3			1.2																					
24	2	The common phrase 'knowledge is power' accurately paints the situation at hand. Through censorship in libraries, which are meant to allow free access to all media-related materials, we take away the opportunity for people to empower themselves through knowledge. The reasons for not censoring media in libraries are numerous and include, but are not limited to, unconstitutionality of censorship, the lack of proper definition for 'offensive', and the contradiction censorship poses to the core of what a library is.      The first, and most blatant, reason for not allowing the censorship of materials in libraries is the unconstitutionality of the matter. Freedom of speech and freedom of press are both protected by the constitution upon which our country was founded. Censorship of said materials will effectively undermine both of these rights. Authors, illustrators, journalists and the slew of other individuals who compose the materials available in libraries are exercising their right to free speech through their works. They are constitutionally protected in the things they say. Notice that @CAPS1 have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended. The freedom of press is the means by which they share their ideas and concepts with the world. They are utilizing their free speech by means of press. Censoring library materials would be limiting the means by which artists can share their ideas with citizens of the @LOCATION1. This would be a clear failure to uphold the rights of the citizens. For this reason, we cannot censor libraries.      The constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well. There is no adequate legal definition of 'offend'. People could be offended by something as serious as a personal attack on their beliefs and personal entity or something as light as a personal distaste for certain mindsets and ideas. So, because all men are equal, we would have to respect the 'offense' taken by all people and to all degrees. This leaves every single work of art, whether it be a book, movie, magazine or any other form provided by libraries, open to the fickle definition of offensive and vulnerable to the personal feelings of every individual. If said offense taken by individuals to works is able to mark a work as 'offensive' and thus make it open to removal from libraries, we are effectively allowing citizens to undermine the rights of other citizens. This is something that cannot be allowed in our libraries.      The final core issue is the essence of censorship versus the essence of a library. Censorship is meant to create a politically correct and non-offensive environment through the limitation of exposure to materials. Libraries, however, are meant to allow public access to works that stretch and challenge knowledge, beliefs, notions and all ideas held by people through the works of others. Censorship cannot be implemented without a clash with the essence of a library's purpose. If censorship were to be enacted, a library could not provide new information if someone else did not like what was being taught. A library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretching occurred. Pre-conceived notions could not be defeated with the presence of factual knowledge if someone did not like the truth. In all of these ways, and many more, a library's core ideals and purpose could not be upheld with the induction of a system of censorship.      All in all, we can see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system libraries abide by. The constitutional rights of citizens would be infringed upon, the fickle nature of humans and the lack of definition for 'offensive' would allow people to undermine the rights of others, and the essence of what a library really is would be ravaged. We cannot, as @CAPS1 with rights, employ a system of censorship	5			0
