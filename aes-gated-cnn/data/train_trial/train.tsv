1	2	Newspaper staff and/or whom it @MONTH1 concern,      Reading material found in a library is very useful and informative to the world, there is no limit to what could be found on paper. Whether it be offensive or not, having limits to books will only create tension, effect the economy, and will lead to illegal activity, ironically enough, in which offensive books will be written and sold, completely undercover.      In today's world, it would be nearly impossible to pick up a book and factually state that it is not offensive. Almost everyone has some little issue with something in the world today, and because of that, original and unoffensive material are hard to come by. With the stripping of offensive material from libraries, authors will be devastated, not just emotionally, but will be out of a job and will have less income. Because of how virtually impossible it is to write a book that is not offensive, authors will become very frustrated, and most are very passionate about what they do. Also, because almost all reading material is offensive in some way, there will be little to no reading material on the selves of the world or nation's libraries. @CAPS1 could potentially lead to violent protests that quickly tear down even the most successful of nations. However, physical devastation would not be the only toll paid for the stripping of offensive reading material from libraries      Books cost money; to make books costs money, to buy books costs money. Paper companies would take a major nose-dive in the market, having almost no clientel. When a major divistion such as the paper industry falls, it will bring others down as @CAPS2, and due to the nation's market complexity, almost all major companies rely on paper. @CAPS1 would ruin the economy. Some might say, '@CAPS1 means that the people of @LOCATION1 will be much more green!' @CAPS2, the past few centuries when economics and the environment are put on a scale, economics takes the cake by a mile. Obviously, @CAPS1 will do much more harm than good. The people of the world always have a priority. Also, the majority of the people don't enjoy having something taken that they have grown so fond to.      People, in general, want what they can't have. An obvious example would be illegal drugs; the drug market is extremely successful, but it's illegal. If people were to have these currently illegal drugs for their use, being completely legal, chances are that the success of drug marketing will plummet. The opposite situation for books: We have them now, but when they are taken, we will want them even more. People who read tend to be very passionate about literature and very intellegent. All it takes is one group to gain numbers, and have a very talented speaker persuede others to follow in a potentially violent revolt to be given back permission to write and publish alleged 'offensive' books. All other material found in libraries, such as music and movies, being taken away will have the same effects, give or take a few similarities or differences.      Avoiding such problems is easy, keep the books and all other material in a library on the shelves. It will only be problematic to take it all away, especially for being offensive, when there are very few books that the general population will find not offensive. If keeping the material in libraries means individuals will become offended for very different reasons, let it be organized chaos. @CAPS1 is how people work, and keeping the material on the selves is how the people are pleased or motivated	4			0																					
2	2	Books, music, movies, magazines, we've all had the pleasure of seeing/reading/watching our favorites, but many are considered unsatisfactory in their content to younger children. Parents, now than ever, are concerned about how their children are raised, and are always looking to clear inappropriate things away from their lives. Things with heavy violence, gore, language and even scenes of sexual content, all of these are wanted by all parents to be censored from their childs' eyes. There are many reasons why parents worldwide wish to hide these things from the eyes of the young, such as; personal influence, emotional growth and even the chance of a child becoming disobedient to the parent. These are all valid reasons why some things should be removed from the public eye.     Again, we've all read or heard things that affect us personally, maybe you read on how you can make your life happier, or maybe you heard an inspirational song that conviced you to follow your dreams. Well, this is also true for everyday books, movies, magazines or music. If someone is introduced to something telling of a life with hatred or someone living in a violent way, it can influence a young reader to wish to live the same style of life if it sounds even a little remotely fun. True, children are encouraged to have fun, but to a certain, but safe extent.     These are even known to affect someone's emotions. Maybe a great song that made you happy, or a movie that made you laugh. But it is true the opposite way as well. Songs that are dark and have a gloomy feeling to them can make a person feel depressed, or a scary movie @MONTH1 leave a person with a new fear or a nightmare in their sleep the same night. It has even been known that some children are left traumatized for life just because they weren't ready for what they saw in certain violent and gorey scenes. These are all things that parents want to keep away from their children in order to keep them safe. People are very easily moved by any form of information, song and story alike. It is our responsibility to keep the good influences around and keep the bad ones away.     Children are easily affected in behavior, maybe they just saw a movie of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and thought he was so cool and they wanted to be just like him. If a child is exposed to a movie of great violence or bad influence, the child @MONTH1 then start following what happened in it and begin not listening to their parents. It is only right to keep these bad influences away until they are able to handle things so violent or misfortunate.     So yes, certain materials should be taken away from the public eye, for the safety of the community and for its' children. Books, movies, music, magazines - We've all seen/read/listened to them, but what have they influenced on you? Have you become a better person for doing so? Or a worse one? Or maybe you weren't affected at all? We need to be careful about what is available to us and to the rest of the world. Keeping the bad things away from our children and from anyone who can be influenced in a negative way is a top priority for any one person, group or business.	2			2.5																					
3	2	Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 are many books, music, and magazines that are saturated with offensive words or obscene themes.  However, just because a book or song contains an foul word does not mean that the book needs to be sheltered from the public's eyes.  @CAPS2 are many reasons we should not censor public media.  We cannot ignore wrongdoings happening in our world; plus, in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech; and, finally, if media was censored, people @MONTH1 start to think every little word has an offensive connotation.     If a bystander observes a person being abused in a hallway or alley, the bystander just cannot pretend like the incident never happened.  If the world never reported accidents, @CAPS2 would be too much crime and terror.  Sometimes, a book or movie is like a cry for help or a way to raise awareness about some wrongdoing in the world today.  Most of the time, I only hear about an event through movies or books, and I want to know the honest story, not a fairytale version of it.  After all, if the language in some slavery books was not as vivid as it is, some people @MONTH1 not oppose slavery as strongly as they do.    Here in @LOCATION1, we have the freedom of speech.  We are allowed to give our opinions on any topic, and describe it in any way.  We should be permitted to say anything we want, even though in our hearts, we should know what is right and wrong.  People should at least be trusted enough to use their own conscience.     Also, another reason why books and other media should not be censored is because people @MONTH1 judge almost every little word offensive then.  Then we @MONTH1 have 'no books left on the shelf' according to Katherine Paterson.  Once people are allowed to censure books or other media, they would look for words with negative connotations.  If a word was close to being offensive in one person's perspective, it would be left out.  Then, many words would be gone.     Sure some types of media, especially songs and movies, just spill out nasty themes and foul language.  However, I have the choice to watch a movie or listen to a song.  I can always change the radio station if I do not like what I am hearing.  People however, just cannot remove the words of another right from their mouth, no matter how bad it is.  We just cannot pretend that we all live in a perfect world where everyone is polite and caring.  If we hear about something wrong in our world today, we need to act.  However, we might not act if we do not know the full extent of its terror.                                                            Sincerely,                                                              @PERSON2	2			2.5																					
6	2	In the quote that @PERSON1 wrote she talks about how books can be taken down from a shelf if it is too provokative.  This is a very interesting quote.  She talks about how things should be taken of the shelf to prevent the children from seeing it.  In everyday life there are things that are said in movies, music, and magazines that kids should never watch, hear or read.      Some movies can be way too provokative.  Directors try and cover them up, but we know what they are trying to get across.  Some scenes can get out of control and there is no stopping it.  People wish they could close their eyes and it would all be over.  When parents get movies they try and keep those scenes hidden from their children.  The parents do not want to get their child having bad ideas of what the movies are saying.  To many children take the movies to the extreme and try and act like the actors or actresses, and the children end up getting hurt from these actions.     Music is especially one to do this.  There are not a lot of  songs in the world that do not involve language, drugs, or sexual content in it.  Many parents do not want them to be exeposed to that way to soon.  If people listen to this they might want to try it and end up going down a wrong path from these words that are said.  Mothers do not want to go get their child out of jail from doing something that was just like the song they like to listen to.  That is not a mothers dream to go and do that.     There are too many magazines that try and expose women.  They use this to try and see more magazines.  This is wrong to do.  A little while back a magazine took pictures of a girl and tried to expose her, this is just wrong.  Parents do not want their children to look at this and get the wrong idea.  When girls look at a model in a magazine they try and be just like the model.  They girls end up being underweight, sick, and maybe do drugs.  Parents if they see this should take the magazine away from them if it is not what they approve.          Some parents let their kids get away with too much.  They should censor what their children do.  Some kids will try and get around them so there is not helping them.  Everyones point of view is different.  People @MONTH1 think that this scene is to provocative and another person @MONTH1 look at that and say there is nothing wrong.  It just depends on how society feels about the whole situation.  If we were to take a movie or music down because of what they say then there would be no contents on the shelf	2			2.5																					
7	2	Libraries are a great resource for information all around the world.  They contain many different styles and genres of books.  Some might not be appropriate for young children to read.  There are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves.  I believe that no book should be denied of this right.  Most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times.     Most libraries have children sections.  Offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section.  So, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway.  Children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but I doubt they would want to read a book about them.     Next, if a child goes up to the check out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child.  Going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library.  If an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not.     Finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like.  They worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off.  If librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves.  The quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly.  People should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not.  Children being able to do this? Depends on the parent.      There is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing.  Yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen.  Just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children doesn't mean a revolt has to happen.  Those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read.  Some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read.	2			2.5																					
8	2	I think that everyone has different views on different things so I dont think that they should be because if they would be that would be against the first amendment where it says everyone have the freedom of religion and speech.  If you disagree with the book or whatever it @MONTH1 be you can just ignore it and keep walking and never have to pay any attention to it.  People these days are taking things way to far with their opinions.     People need to mind their own business and stop thinking the world revolves around them.  There several billion people in the @LOCATION1 and every person looks at thing slightly different and this should be taken into consideration when the get mad just because there is a book or movie on the shelf of the library.  For example I like movies with comedy and sometimes a scary movie but girls @MONTH1 not like scary movies and @MONTH1 like movies with droma or somthing in that line.  Just because we like different things doesn't mean we should have to put just a so certain kind of books or movies on the shelf.       Yes, there are movies that I dont like because they stand for things that are against my religion but I dont stand around and say no one should watch these movies because just because I dont beleive in them doesn't mean I should judge other people for it.  I know some people feel that everyone one should look at things the same way as they do and everyone should should agree and get along but that is not how it is and no matter how much you want people to agree and get along it will never happen.  I think people need to mind their own business and let people read, listen to, and watch whatever they want to and it should not affend anyone.     I know people like to think that they know everything there is to know just because they have their own ways and thoughts.  People like this you can argue with and you will never win the arguement and you can never get them to understand how you look at it. They just think think my way is the right way and the only way.       This is the way I feel about people getting mad when there is a book or movie on the shelf that they dont not agree with.  I just think that evryone should try to undersatnd what you are saying and listen to you instead of ignoring you.  I feel this way but I am not a person that is tuck in their ways where you cant change their mind.	1			3.75																					
11	2	I belive that beople have the right to know and learn about stuff even if it is found offensive, the reasone why i say this is because if one person finds it offensive doesn't mean that another person might think it is. If people think that a film from back in the late @NUM1's about the @ORGANIZATION1 that is used for educational perposes is racist, then they need to just grow up and to go back to school for this stuff. Just because some people think that a book with vulger language is offencive then they need to know that more than half of the worlds book have profanitey in them and just because it does, doesn't mean that they need to be removed form the shelfs in the library.     I have had my own incounters with books that i thought were offencive, there was a book that i was reading in my fresh year of high school and there were people in it that were part of the @PERSON2 and they were having meetings and one guy said that he hated negros and they he had picked one for tonigh and were going to lynch them with the nuse they had made the night before and that really hurt me because I have some one in my famliy that is black and to think about someone doing that to him, that would just break my heart and I would probaly go out and find the people that did it and kill them.       In the quote that was writen by Katherine Paterson, she talked about how if she has the right to remove a book then we do to and if we do so then there will be no more books left for us on the shelf is a great way to say that almost everybook we have has something volger in them and if we were to take them all away then there would be none left. If there was the posibility of all the books being taken away from us then there would be a huge uprising and everything would be going down hill form there, because there are people that can't go a day with out reading a part of there book and some people have devoted three hours to reading ounce a day.     What im trying to say is that there is no way to get rid of our books today that have volger langage or something offencive in them because if we tryed to do that then we would be taking every book away in the world and then no one would be learning anything	1			3.75																					
12	2	No, I dont think you should be able to take the magazines off the shelf because it is pointless,to some people @MONTH1 find everything offensive and others @MONTH1 not find it offensive like me personally stuff people find offinsive I find it kind of humorous.       And I understand how some people are more likely to be offended because of say their sexuality or ethnicity. But other than that there should be no censorship it makes the place that is doing it seem like they are very strict and because of those strict policys it makes some people wanna go there less to get what they want and who knows the thing you @MONTH1 want @MONTH1 be censored.  And I understand that when you have a kid you dont want them to fo the wrong things in life and try and keep them away from the bad stuff as long as possible.  But as your child grows older he will be introduced to older/adult type material and you should cut them a break and not punish them very bad when something like that happens.  From my humble opinion some parents are very strict about censorship and I completely understand the parents point of view.     Eventually people will have to let their children find out about certain things, so you might as well allow them to see it at possibly the age of @NUM1 or so that seems like a suitable age for early privelages.  When it comes to taking items off a shelf some peole have worse judgement than other people and that can effect everyone from their bad judgement.	3			1.2																					
13	2	In libraries there are a bunch of books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. to let the general public check out. This topic about censorship in libraries is a diffitcult one because everyone has different views on things in life. Certain materials in libraries should not be remove from the shevles if they are found offensive by someone.           Being in a library there are lots of choices to see and check out. In a library, someone comes arcoss a book or a movie that seems offensive to them. That someone should just look at the other way because a library is for the general public. It seems to be harse about this, but it is not up to that person if the material in the library should or should not be in that library. The materials that are offensive to people could be in a special place in the library to comitdate everyone.      Libraries have the right to censor any type of material that seems or is offensive to the community. This is right if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries. If the whole community disagree with a library about a certain material then the community have a say in it.      Yes, there are books out in libraries that are offensive to a group of people, but that does not mean take that material out of the library. Our country, @LOCATION1, say that everyone has the right to free speech. @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 has banned books thats are offensive to @CAPS1, but other countries around the @LOCATION2 might have those books in their libraries.      There is a thick line if a certain type of material in a library is offensive or not. Someone should not have the right if a  book seems offensive to that person, but if the whole community says that the book is offensive then yes.      The libraries and the community have choices to not have a offensive book on the self. If it is offensive to everyone then it should be off the shelf. Censorship is a diffitcult topic to agured on	4			0																					
16	2	Censorship in Libraries     I think that censorship in a library is fine some people @MONTH1 feel that children don't need to see certain things. Which that @MONTH1 be true there are a lot of things that even adult shouldn't even see themselves. If there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things.      People should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library	0			5																					
17	2	It dose not really mater to me, we all have the wright to are one likes and dislikes. Someone @MONTH1 not think that movies with blood in thim should alowed, but other @MONTH1 thimk that movie with adalt content should not not be alowed. If you dont like something and someone eles dose why should you get what you want and not what someone eles want. So if we tacke one movie, book, magazine, type of song or music off the market why dont we just all of thim off the market. Then there will be no arument about what is soutibal to watch and what is not. So if you dont like somthing or have littal kids and dont want thim to watch something or read somthing or look at somthing then just bont bay thim and if you do make sore it were they cant reach or fine or get to	2			2.5																					
18	2	Libraries in @LOCATION1     I am going to write a persuasive essay about what I think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive thing in the book. I dont think that just because it is offensive someone it should be taken off the shelf, because some people have different views over the book or magazine. So I am going to tell what I think over this subject.          I think if someone dose'nt like whats in the book they should just not read it or something, because some people might find it interesting. People just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others. For example the author of the book or magazine some how relates to them, and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also. Thats why I think people should not argue about taking books off the shelf and start thinking of others. Thats what I think about people trying to take the books off the shelf.     So whoever is reading this please take this in consideriation and relize that some people like different books than others. So don't start taking books off the shelf just because a few people find them offensive. So thats all I have to say about people that are trying to get them taken off the shelf because there offensive to them	4			0																					
21	2	What if someone told you that you couldn't wear a yellow shirt because it was offensive? What if they said you couldn't look a certain way because you might offend somebody? Not just one person or group of people have the right to decide what is suitable and what is not. There are so many different religions and traditions throughout the @LOCATION2 it would be completely rediculous to set one standard for all people. If @CAPS1 aren't restricted when it comes to apperal, groceries, or automobiles, why should there be limits in the libraries? Libraries should not be censored because not only would censorship limit the resoursfulness of the libraries and smother the knowledge intake across the @LOCATION2, but it would also pose a threat to our future.      When one takes a trip to the library, one would expect to find a book, magazine, and/or movie on just about anything. It would be extremely frustrating to find that a library, which is supposed to contain content on nearly every subject, does not have what your looking for. Say a book on the asassination of @PERSON1 is what you fancy, so you ask the librarian where you could find it. You would be dissapointed if she says they don't carry assassination books because they are too vulgar for young children. This could become very troubling and would limit the library's resources.           Not only would censorship in libraries limit the content but it would also limit learning in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 are people supposed to stay informed if they are being sheilded from knowledge? Many people that do not have computers depend on the library. If they cannot get what they need at the library where would they go? The libraries would lose business and funding if they did not supply library-goers with the content which they desire. People would take their business elsewhere. Protests @MONTH1 break out and rebelious citizens @MONTH1 protest the censorship, causing an uproar in society.           The people would not be the only thing out of hand. The censorship would surely get out of hand, aswell. @CAPS1 are already being censored through news stations, radio, and tv shows. Libraries are a place where infinant knowledge is realistic and that is comforting for many @CAPS1. In libraries people choose what they learn: they aren't forced teachers or parents. The censorship @MONTH1 start out as a small intervention, but it could turn our nation upside down. Next thing we know, our desisions could be influenced by the books that only 'they' decide are suitable. What kind of society would we have then? Individuality would be lost and opinions would be forgotten.      Clearly, censorship in libraries is dangerous and unpredictable. If libraries were cencored, not only would  knowledge in the @LOCATION2 desinegrate, but libraries would lose their respect and threaten the future of @LOCATION1. No one tells me what to wear or say, so why should anyone tell me what to read? We are all entitled to our own opinions and beliefs. Our @CAPS4 @CAPS5 earned us our freedoms, we can not let censorship take them away	0			5																					
22	2	Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     @CAPS1 I was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple.  For children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing.  Their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does grab every child now and then.  With a stubborn persistance, a child would probably go to the ends of the earth to understand what confidential information they overheard their parents talking about.  But @CAPS1 does harmless curiosity mean the destruction of a child's innocence?  By viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development.  However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book,  that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 find the contents inappropriate.     Authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust.  A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice.  Thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work.  Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society.  Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended.     Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race.  Even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of man's imagination.  Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is.  Just as remembering the @CAPS2 has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @MONTH1 save authors from repeating such dishonorable content.  In other words, if censorship removes the 'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that 'mistake'.  By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature.  @CAPS1 books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature.  All literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret.     Finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature?  A book on @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be inappropriate in the eyes of a @CAPS4, but that book @MONTH1 be sacred to a @CAPS5.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message.  A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person.  If one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests.  The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group.     Censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privelage of the reader to decide what is appropriate.  Authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them.  Every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes.  And these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself.  Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent.                                   -@ORGANIZATION2	0			5																					
23	2	Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society.  Our lives have been taken over by politcal correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own.  Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media.  But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned.  Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our @CAPS2 as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech.  Censorship actively and violently violates that right.  Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away.  Our own words forced down our throats, never allowed to come out.  Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves.  Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech?  We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say.  We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them.  Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form.  Arguements come, but these arguements allow people to see other ideas that they hadn't thought of and look at issues from new perspectives.  We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions.  And from there we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with iddeas and knowledge, and allowing our society to advance.  But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone.  But there will always be someone who is unhappy.  It's the inevitable truth.     Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world.  In a way this makes sense.  We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life.  We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors.  However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come.  Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them.  For example, let's look at the issue of rape.  Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens.  It is a nasty part of reality.  Rape can be censored from books, televsion, and other forms of media.  We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist.  But that doesn't accomplish anything.  That doesn't get rid of rape.  It still exists.  And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop?  How will a rape ever be able to be prevented?  How will someone know what to expect or what to do?  By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape.  Knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped.  Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't get rid of it.  Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't.  It hurts the people, cutting off their access to knowledge.     We as people need knowledge.  We live off of knowledge.  And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media.  Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually.  It @MONTH1 not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp.  Is this fair?  Is this right?  Is this helping us?  How does cutting out knowledge ever help?  It brings us backwards in time, makes us fear.  It is human nature to fear the unknown.  The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear.  Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society.  This is wrong and immoral.  It is unfair, if nothing else.  We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists.  No good comes from hiding it.     Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways.  And as time goes on it can only get worse.  Censorship is based off of offensiveness.  If something could be offensive, it is disposed of.  However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone.  Therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship.  This means all media of any kind should be destroyed.  No one should say anything.  The world would be forced to be silent.  All knowledge would be taken away.  Chaos would ensue.  The people's freedom would be completely taken away.  The freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes.  This is our future if we allow the censorship to continue.  We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship.  Yes, people's feelings will be hurt, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge purely to spare feelings.  These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away.     Censorship is taking away our freedoms and @CAPS2, slowly stealing them away from us.  It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never be able to stop the very things that are being censored.  Censorship is affecting society, ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away.  All knowledge will be trashed and no one will be able to voice their opinions.  A very dark future waits for us if censorship continues.  Only by helping people to understand censorship and the wrong it does to society can we gain back our freedom of speech; the freedom we are supposedly guaranteed, but censorship is desperately trying to take away.	3			1.2
