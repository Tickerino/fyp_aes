5	2	A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world. The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves.     Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discrimate against certain ethnicity's need to be removed immediately from libraries. @CAPS2, there are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they @MONTH1 offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves!     Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries.  By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music.     Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2, that is a nieve comment as @CAPS1 as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved.     In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as @CAPS1. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society	1			3.75																					
10	2	Without books we all would not know what we know now.Its just like saying without a heart your body will still function. Books today are basically telling you real life things that happen or can happen if you do anything. Personally books are made for a reason, whether some people like it or not. Books help you get a better understanding of many things someone else @MONTH1 not know,and or understand.The same thing goes for musis, movies, and magazines.      I clearly understand where some parents, guardians, and caregivers come from, but they have to realize that everything they think is wrong for our society today really is helping the next person. Also someone else is thinking different then they are. Books are another way of learning as well, they all are not bad for the younger or whosoever it @MONTH1 be. They also help you get a better meaning of alot of things. I am not only going to say that books are most peoples main problem, but there are some movies, music,and magazines. But some tell you what age it is suitable for. For movies they tell you things like '@NUM1, @CAPS1' and other things like that. Also for music all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they have them with or without anything bad on it. Magazines they have many different varieties of things for all ages and you pick the ones you want for you or your child.     Everything is not all bad, it is what you feel is right for your child or whosoever it @MONTH1 be. You can not blame others for what they feel needs to be heard or said to some. You have to look outside the box and know that there are people who really need to hear, see, and or do. Just to better themselves as a individual. People are so quick to judge the next but really don't try to understand that everyone needs help and that just because your life or whatever @MONTH1 seem to be heading in the right direction at that time doesn't mean someone elses can't change.Those things are there for a reason if you dont like it then try a better way to get away from it.     Without those things in our life I really can see this world falling apart. We barely understand what some of the books, music, movies, and magazines are talking about so just try to  picture all that being taken away. Its not a pretty site, accept the things that we have now and use them to the best of your ability. They all are there for a reason.	2			2.5																					
15	2	I dont think that music, magazines, books, or movies should be removed from the shelf because if some people dont like it some other people might find it intertaining than what other people do. I think that if people dont want there children to see it then dont let them.     I believe that children should have the right to know about some things but not all. I mean everyone has the right to know about what is going on or what happened years and years ago. I mean it is all put out there to be seen not hidden from eople because people want others to know what has happened even if they take  it the wrong way.     I would rather my children know about everything so they know what is wrong and what is right. There is some stuff out there in books, magazines, and ect. that shoouldnt be seen or heard of but people listen and read it all the time no matter what it is. Schools teach children about almost anything does that mean schools should be shut down? No!     Some people homeschool their kids for that reason ,but do they think about when they go out in public what people say or do? I dont think so, there is really no reason that if people take it offensive about something they read or listen to.     There is no reason for people to take it off the shelf if they dont like it because other people will and they will buy it just to listen or to read something. People need to realize that there is stuff everywhere that people dont want their children hearing but they hear it anyway. It is just hoe our economy is these days.	1			3.75																					
20	2	Should we remove offensive items or materials from a public library? My belief is no because many people in today's society are pretty offensive themselves and the books are meant to show the life of fiction or fact and when you do censor something the other person will try his or her best to try and find an uncensored version of the same material.      Art books are another thing that should not be censored because the artist is not trying to be perverse or offensive he or she is just trying to show his vision of art in the form he or she feels people would find artistic.  Censorship is important in some ways but you also have to have an opened mind because someone who finds something offensive might not feel that way later on in their life.      So my belief is don't censor something because it might offend some, because there are many who probably don't take offense to it be it books,music,videos,video games,writing,or movies.      We are all going to have a democracy over if something should or shouldn't be appropriate.     So what are your thoughts censor a book because of it's content or leave it and let the people decide?      My thoughts would be censorship is moral but you also have to think it would be immoral to take a book away from a reader that might find this book interesting.      So please don't censor books from our public library, we need books that have facts or fiction in them but also have a great story in it's words.          My other thought would be what i would do is let the reader decide censor it or keep it the way it was intended.	1			3.75																					
25	2	@CAPS1 happened to using books and films as simple entertainment? Why are we now cautious of @CAPS1 our children pick off the shelf? Society today has changed the way we once viewed our sources of entertainment. Books are now viewed with skepticism and once harmless movies and magazines are full of material no one should be reading or watching. Music used to be a beautiful form of art, but now when you turn on your radio, @CAPS1 do you hear? Mindless spewing of words linked together with curses and other garbage. Should libraries use caution when renting something to someone who shouldn't be using that material for harmless entertainment.     There once was a young girl, fourteen or fifteen, who loved to read and listen to music. She was bright but shy, and used books as her friends. Each day she walked to the library for a new story to dive in. One day she came across a book on the top shelf of the fiction section. The book looked used, for its spine was badly split and several of the pages were nearly detached. She reached for the book, intrigued, and flipped through the pages. Her innocent and naive mind caught a hold of a world she didn't know. After reading the book, she was filled with guilt. It wasn't a good book, but a book that was laced with a harmful message. This young girl, once pure and simple, now knew things no one at that age should know. So, why wasn't there a warning of some sort?     The difference between writing something offensive and being offensive is that the writer usually doesn't intend to be hurtful or rude. The author most likely intended for the peice of literature to be enjoyed with a clear and playful attitude. However the comparison between writing something offensive and being offensive is far different. When you read something in a book or magazine that disturbs you, put it down, or throw it away. No one is forcing you to read the material. Yet, the real question is; @CAPS1 about our children? How do we keep them safe from offensive literature? And @CAPS1 about music? Or movies?     Remember the old black and white films? How, no matter @CAPS1 the plot or storyline is, the two leading roles somehow fall in love in the end? The ending title fills the screen just before the two actors share a kiss and then the screen goes black. Mind, there are still movies with happy endings and a positive message. @CAPS1 about the other films? Some of the biggest blockbusters are those which have either violence, some form or racism, and/or sexual content. Personally going to the movies to see a new action movie that looks thrilling and entertaining should be fun, but where does the fun stop? After the guy in the first scene has just been brutally murdered? Or after the two lovers share a special bond that should be kept private? And @CAPS1 happens when this movie is released and checked out from the library by a young boy who just wants a fun sleepover with his friends? How do we keep these sorts of material away from them?     Libraries should use major caution when priting labels to place on their books, movies, magazines, etc. Librarians should make sure that the book a child hands to them is safe to read for that age level. Also, they should check the ratings on movies or make them not available to certain age group. Parents should also use caution when letting your child go to the movies with friends. Make sure they see something fun, but with a positive message.     Should libraries take certain material off their shelves? I don't think so. However, be careful @CAPS1 you read or watch, for it might not please you. Use the internet as a source to find reviews on books and magazines, so see how well it was rated and then decide whether it is an intriguing read or an amazing film. Have fun, but be careful	3			1.2
