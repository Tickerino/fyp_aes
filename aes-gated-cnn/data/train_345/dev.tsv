11	3	The setting of the authors � shortcut� effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well.� Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills.� The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views.� I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill.� The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said, � success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts.� I believe that @PERSON2 agrees.	3	2		3																					
16	3	In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the author Joe Kurmaskie uses the features of the setting to affect the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by these features because of he sees the same setting (the dessert) for several miles, he has no water and, the road has a lot of hills. The cyclist could been affected by seeing the dessert and no scenary changes for a wahile. When you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything. So this cause him to be very drossy and bored. Also the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains were cold water. Having no water out in the dessert could make you dehydrate and faint.	1	2		2																					
18	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. Since he is riding in the California desert, he always feels very hot and is always in constant thirst. In addition to this the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate. He finds nothing but old abondored buildings. He doesn't find anyone. No people or cars, or any sign of modern civilization. This causes him to feel a little unnerved as if something happened to him nobody would know about it. This is especially prevelent when he become dehydrated. In those ways, the cyclist is very much affected by the setting.	2	2		2																					
26	3	The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old men�s help, and doesn�t seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next �town� he hits doesn�t have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasn�t further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief.	3	3		3																					
34	3	Understanding, realitic, mode-all are reason�s how setting affects the setting. If a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good. When you have a setting it�s more understable of what they are trying today. And if you have a good setting it makes it more realitic So when you read it you wont be thrown off, the mode of the story sets it all off, because usually books have there ups and downs. That�s why they chase the mode.  	0	0		0																					
37	3	The features in the story great effect the cyclist. One feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat. At first, the story says that the pine trees cooled the cyclist, but eventually the forest turned into a desert, and the heat poured down on him, make it hard to cycle. Another feature that effected the cyclist was the lack of water. As he moved away from his beginning point, the cyclist was drinking lots of water. But when he needed to refill, the water was brown and hot, so the cyclist didn�t take any. The lack of water plus the heat formed one giant obstacle that potentialy could have killed him, but through great determination the cyclist got through this troubling time.	2	2		2																					
44	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist.The features of the setting, or nature, affect the cyclist because they are wearing her out. The cyclist is going to the city of of yosemite but some guys gave her a short cut. Through this shortcut are hills and heat and lack of water. @CAPS1 describes this by saying, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.� @CAPS1 is excited that there is a building that @CAPS1 might get some water from. Also, @CAPS1 wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and @CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. Therefore, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
46	3	In the story of �rough road ahead :do not exceed posted limit� the setting affected the cyclist. In the middle of the desert during the summer the cyclist was low on water. The old men gave him the wrong directions, so mainly it is the old guys thought he dies. The cyclist survives but the heat and the season he was riding he�ll probably bring another water botlle nextime	1	1		1																					
48	3	"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. �This sight was troubling� when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. �At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1�s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.� He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.    "	3	3		3																					
49	3	Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In �Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit� the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how �The sun was beginning to beat down� expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their �shortcut.� Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with �one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest male.� @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a �battery-acid� flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he �had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.� His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn�t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel.	3	3		3																					
52	3	The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist �traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.� He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank �water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure.	3	2		3																					
61	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
64	3	The cyclist is mostly affected by his lack of water. In the beginning of his ride the cyclist is confident and is striving to reach the joys of @LOCATION1. He longs for, �the cool pines and rushing rivers�� (@NUM1). Later on when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain, he starts feeling exhaustion as he depletes his water supply. A bit of relief later comes upon him after a long climb over a hill until he sees a shut down juice factory almost seeming like it was put there to tease him. His destination fills him with relief and pride, knowing that he would survive the strenuous journey.	2	2		2																					
70	3	"The setting affects the  author alot. First he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out. This makes the cyclist very tired. There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one  to help him if he were to have a heat stroke."	1	1		1																					
76	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.	1	1		1																					
78	3	The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author. The affect was bad rather that good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoltering temperatures. Another feature that had a great impeidence on the author�s well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbed across at the snack. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when author tried to get water. There was also Brackish water in the that tasted suspiciously like Battery acid.	1	1		1																					
81	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over, �short rolling hills,� and arround a,�ridiculously large snake,� and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut. So yes the author is affected by the setting	1	1		1																					
87	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, �Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.�	2	2		2																					
88	3	The setting in the features of the cyclist is that if it is too hot or too cold, it could affect how the cyclist is riding . If it�s to hot the cyclist would get exhausted a lot faster . And if it�s to cold then the cyclist would @MONTH1 be get sick . Also if it�s  too windy then he would go a lot slower if he is going in the wind�s direction.	1	1		1																					
92	3	The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
93	3	In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclist�s surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in �the high deserts of California in June,� the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings.	2	2		2																					
103	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
106	3	There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, �several rusty bumps,� is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn�t riding on smooth ground he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also he had a huge lack of water he was water depleted he couldn�t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. �Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,''  this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehidrated, and very tired.	3	2		3																					
110	3	"The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. The text says, �The sun was beginning to beat down�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The hot sun was making the cyclist sweat. He was losing water. This was making him dehadrayted faster. The text says. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to ride up were wearing him out. He was getting tierd faster. The text says. �I stubled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The modern bathroom had good, cold water. This allowed the cylist to drink from it. The water replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain some of his strength. Then the cyclist could carry on."	2	2		2																					
116	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him.	1	1		1																					
117	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man�s journey he was confident in his abilities. �I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.�  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June� without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey. "	3	3		3																					
127	3	"In the stories, don�t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      "	3	3		3																					
135	3	The setting easily can affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in which the cyclist was in the seemed to be abandoned which doesn�t give a well thinking to this person . If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won�t be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly infront of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist. The conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him.	3	3		3																					
137	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting. The features are just not right and and they could be changed around a little bit and still have about the same meaning of the essay. So I think they should change it around.	1	2		2																					
138	3	The features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist. He is going on this bike ride through the deserts of �california in June. This obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very fast. At one point he says, �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed.� @CAPS1, the setting of having all these ghost towns was troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beggining to rum out of water.  The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� When your petalling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you. If he was in a different setting this felling of despair would not be      in the story. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
139	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Ti�s better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing what�s going to happen next.	1	1		1																					
143	3	The features of the setting greatly  effected the cyclist.  He was  riding along   on a  route he had little confidence would end up anywhere. That being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework. The temperature was very hot, where was little shade, the   sun was beating down on him. The route was very discouraging .all the cyclist wanted wanted   was water and the route kept touenting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that approved to be an old bottling factory for Welch�s  grape  juice. The cyclist would appear  to be closing in on something to drink, but be left with nothing.	3	2		3																					
144	3	During the cyclist bike ride the unbearable conditions changed his attitude when he firsts starts the reader can sense frustration because of the old timers and there directions. Then as he realizes that he might have enough water his attitude changes. The cyclist goes from frustrated to loving the secenery, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,� as the conditions changed to even more unbearable heat. He decided to just give up. Until he got courage and �slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� When he saw Gary and Wilber�s fish camp, he realized he was safe.	2	2		2																					
146	3	�Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from California June, but not none the less. Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12. And worse a billboard of �a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,� this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding contributed to his hoplessness.	2	3		3																					
147	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by one, the conditions of the road were awful. Two, the cyclist said there was a huge snake blocking his path as well as the occasional tumble weed. The biggest affect on the cyclist was the lack of water with unbearable heat and he was tired. Those are the affects the features of the setting had on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
148	3	"If I had a choice to ride a bike in California or vermont, it would be a no-brairer to bike in vermont. The temperature in vermont would be much cooler than in California. In the story the cyclist comlains about the ""wide rings of dried sweat"" and the possibility of heatstroke. It is proven that when temperatures rise, you tend to lose more water from your body. Had the cyclist gone to a cooler site at a different time of year he wouldn't have struggled with dehydration on his bike ride. "	1	1		1																					
158	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster. The road might be up the hill so he @MONTH1 go slow. There could be a possibility that the road might have bump rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through. So the affect of the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made.	1	1		1																					
164	3	Many different things affected on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a �ghost town� there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, directions he was given, and lack of water. When the cyclist come across the bait shop he know he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and water.	2	2		2																					
165	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says � The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was don�t ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh�. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back.. Blocked the major of the parement in front of me""."	3	2		3																					
168	3	"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of no  where that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those @NUM1 also said, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (@PERSON1). I dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work."	2	2		2																					
170	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist. 	1	2		2																					
173	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist in various different ways. First of all he listened to the old man so he was on the wrong path. So he travels and it�s a hot June day in California deserts. The odds are against him from the start �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June��(Kurmaskie @NUM1) From the ganle you can tell that hes tired and almost out of water. It puts a lot of strain on the cyclist but he manages.	2	2		2																					
174	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...� This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip.  "	2	2		2																					
181	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. It affected him because it was saying @NUM1 miles and then were in the first town, thinking that the cyclist was getting excited and he was kind of all most done he thought he was going at a fast past. When the cyclist got to the first town he said that it looked dead. And then after he kept moving he kind of knew that he wasnt getting anywhere. Then after thinking he noticed that he had listened to some old folks that had never even been off their porch. So after the cyclist had hit the first town he had known right then and there that ho should never listen to old folkes ever again. Because that first town had looked like nobody has been in it for years.	2	2		2																					
183	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, the road could be bumpy, and the town could be deserted. For example, ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty. And if he is not and with no water he probably could  barely make it up the hills. And with no town for water he would be thirsty.""First ""town"" This place might have been a thriving little spot at one point but anthor warning it fit the outsides of ghost town"" No waters"	2	2		2																					
186	3	The cyclist lost hope because he was in the California desserts in June. The cyclist started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump that pumped out battery-acid tasting water. When he said the sign �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, was very cautious. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist was in the California desert and that made him think he was going to die out there.	2	2		2																					
187	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his trying biking trip through California. In the essay, he describes the weather with �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� While this @MONTH1 not directly characterice the weather, the reader can confin a clear image of the sweltering heat of a desert in the summer. When the author comes across the �ghost town� followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read �Rough Road Ahead,� his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.�"	3	3		3																					
188	3	The setting affects of the cyclist was that the exhaustion was getting to him. What made it worse he was out in the heat sweating which also cause dihidration.	1	1		1																					
193	3	"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The rolling hills were the cyclist�s most challenging problem because they were long and cripppling. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatsroke. However, the cyclist kept a possitive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and wilbells fish camp.� In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort. But with determination,you can accomplish anything!  "	3	3		3																					
194	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit.� The cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does. The narration states, � a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit � sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie). Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist making him tired due to lack of water and sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die.	2	1		2																					
203	3	The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to �short, rolling hills�. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but �tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.� He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless. 	2	3		3																					
208	3	In this I will tell you how the cyclist was being effected. One way is the heat caused him to drink more then her ran out of water. The next was is the misleading old guys that gave him ba directions. Another way was being the long distance and bad terrain slowing him down. The last reason is the snake that slowed him down.	1	2		2																					
209	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. He was riding his bike across a place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food. It was a dangerous journey for him but he made it.	1	1		1																					
211	3	The features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing. It might make you want to go faster and left out your inner speed demon. That�s all I can really tell you. Because personally I don�t think the setting of where you ride your bike doesn�t even matter. Possibly for a bicyclist it can, but to me I don�t even think so.	1	1		1																					
214	3	The features of the setting that the author cyclist through definitely effect not only his mood, but his the physical condition. To start, it is mentioned that he is in �the high deserts California in June,� @CAPS1 it is implied that the weather is hot causing the author to sweat as he bikes along. Next there is a change in terrain an he soon approaches �rolling hills� which are more difficult to bike on. Finally the author sees a sign that reads �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit but he still has to manage getting past the rough road. After passing this road he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated before. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the author�s change in mood.  	3	3		3																					
216	3	The setting affects the biker in many ways. For one, he is riding through the high deserts of California during the month of June. It is naturally hot in the summer, but in the desert, it is twice as hot. This means he will dehydrate quicker, and will need more water. The only water the biker can find is from an old pump, but he couldn�t drink it since it was so hot; nasty tasting. �When I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acid� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was deserted, so nobody could help him. Also, the terrain was bad. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. �the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,� (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous. The biker is being affected in many ways, both mentally and physically.	3	3		3																					
217	3	  The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist was faced with a desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die��. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst. Over all, the setting caused the cyclist major problems, physically, and mentally.	3	3		3																					
225	3	"In the piece, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many  ways. The cyclist felt black humor, despair and then relief due to the features of the setting. The cyclist felt black humor, due to the features. This was because it was very ironic were he was. It was a hot desert and he needed something to drink. He passes a closed juice factory. This spasked his black humor The cyclist felt despair due to the features. This was because as far as he  could see, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind. ""This gave him the feeling there was no chance he could survive. This made him despair. The cyclist felt relief later on due to the features. He eventually got to a bait shop. When he was this live and so he felt relief Of this is, ""Then as easily as  ?  ?  ?   hobbles, thirst and fear were all behind me. In this piece the features were determined how the cyclist felt."	3	2		3																					
228	3	The setting in this story is important because if you don�t have a setting then this will not make sence, setting is something everyone can do. It can be anywhere or anything. The setting helps puts the whole story back together. The setting in this story is @LOCATION1 spending time with his family. Setting is a very important part in a morvie/video.	0	0		0																					
229	3	the way I would set my affected cyclist is by him riding throught. Something u would never thing he can set thought then over coming his intention.	0	0		0																					
239	3	The setting was affecting the character, because as the day got hotter he got thirtier. Also because when he got to the sign about rough roads ahead. He started to get worried and kinda paranoid, so that�s how the setting affected him.	1	1		1																					
242	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn�t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
245	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who haven�t seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldn�t have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldn�t have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his �dehydrated state.� I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldn�t focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldn�t get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite.	3	2		3																					
255	3	The setting of the cyclist was harsh, the weather was too intense to be cycling your heart out all day  .	2	2		2																					
256	3	The feature of setting affect the cyclists because if you are a guy and you ride a bike then you might have to where about falling of your bike, or out of water. I you keep at a fast past and don�t have any water then you can get dehydrated. In the essay it tells how he had ran out of water and he thout he was going to die he had gotten dehydrated but lukly he had find some were to get something to drink	1	1		1																					
263	3	This story was a great motivation for older man that can still be healthy and feel like an teenager again. It showed how much effort he put to his goal and how he survive. Forty miles he peddled for forty miles to drink same water the cyclist was and interesting story not ginaupup	1	1		1																					
269	3	The harsh setting in �DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit �by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to �Yosemite.�	3	2		3																					
270	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hottnes of the deserts of California because the cyclist was sweating, and drinking his water bottles. Also when the cyclist saw the building, he thought he could rest and maybe get a ride to where he was going but, the building was abandoned years earlier so the cyclist couldn�t stop. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
273	3	The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, affect the cyclist because the cyclist is in a desert with no water and trying to find a town there is further than he thinks. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This shows the cyclist did not have much confidens in this desolates area of the jerny.  	1	1		1																					
278	3	Almost all of the cyclist�s surroundings are old and barren. Hot @CAPS1 like weather. The road is hard to ride on. �Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills.� So his ride was a very rough and tiresome one.	1	1		1																					
281	3	When cycling or doing any outdoor sport, the setting matters greatly. If its cold you need a jacket. Hot you need water. Depending on how secure it could be life or death. It could be realy hilly and you might get tired, and if you have no water you could die. Also it depends if its in a city burbed, small town, desert, highway all these factors play a huge roll in cycling	3	2		3																					
290	3	As the cyclist begins his journey, he is confident & exited to have been offered new directions from some �old wise men� which promise a shortcut. This water supply is mediocre & attitude willed against the flat and hilly terrain, untill he realizes the directions are way off  target. The cyclist was making his way to Yosemite when he came to the first �town� but it wasn't a town but more of a ghost dwelling. As he continued hoping the shortcut offered by the old �codgens� would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the hot desert wt a depleting water supply & dwindling spirit. He was disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men and through his his pain & dispair, encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt skrewed over, yet through his will & determination, by rationing water & mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physicall, emotional & mental trials and lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old � codgers� on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be out datted.	3	3		3																					
306	3	After the cyclist spoke to the �old timers who hadn�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,� his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and �tested like battery acid�. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and �ridiculously large snake� and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn�t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded.	3	3		3																					
307	3	"The features of the setting affets the cyclist in afew ways. For example, the features of the �Rough Road� didnt allow him to arive as fast so was drive @NUM1 on a @NUM2 speed limit. Second the fact that he was drivuing through a desert a large snake made its way on the Road, causing the man to have to ""ease past, trying to keep my balance in my dehidrated state.� @CAPS1 again because he was driving through the desert,hegot so hot & started to get dehydrated of lack of water. Lastly the features that there werent any buildings far miles so he was left lost and didnt have anywhere to stop & ask for directions. These few features defenitly affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
312	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when he arrived to the first town the water had tasted like battery acid which made the rider concerve water another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature. The ride would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster.	1	1		1																					
313	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn�t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
316	3	There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One feature is the climate. When you are cycling and it is really hot you can dehydrate very fast. If it is really cold it is harder to breath and catch your breath. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep than you will get very tired quickly and when it is rocky you have a posablity to fall off the bike and hurt yourself. Last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist. Also if the road is so isolated and you get hurt who would find you. This is another deadly situation. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
318	3	The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didn�t have enough space to carry a lot of water and rod to make portrons to drink. Also listening to old guys who didn�t know much didn�t help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel	0	0		0																					
319	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope and nearly lead him to his death.	1	1		1																					
331	3	In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water. He also had to manuver around a snake. It made him tired and dehydratied. His muscles got sore from the rough terrain. He got dehydratied from the sun.	1	1		1																					
332	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because it�s almost like the background and theme of the cyclist The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. He�s showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much he�s indespair at the time. When he says �It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� In this quote he is saying that he @MONTH1 be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows he�s not in a good shape and he knows he�s in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do.	2	3		3																					
334	3	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist. He starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men. The cyclist is very excited about the thought of a short cut and is drinking his water effectliy. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him. He take pressure in thinking about the cool stress of @CAPS1 and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictious stream had an effect on the cyclist. Soon the sun starts to beat on him even more. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage. When he come over the bend he cave to his troubles road and thirst	1	2		2																					
336	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist because if you are going down hil and then hit a rough road you not going to do so good. Like for example he had been going on flat land then it changed to hills lastly into rough road. These conditions could seriously hurt someone.	1	1		1																					
348	3	The way the features of the setting effect  the cyclist in what was, going through hot neighborhoods and very road that made her dehydrated and effected her journey including the long cycling which he had to go up.	1	1		1																					
349	3	In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit�(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end.	2	2		2																					
352	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, �sometimes life can feel so cruel�, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, �somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey"	3	3		3																					
353	3	The features of california and the fact that the cyclist was neave Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous to the cyclist california has a very hot climate, and is neove  a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater man if the had been cyclist in @LOCATION1. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to � short, rolling hills,� which would have made it harder to pedal, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mention how the sun was beating down on him, and that would alos serve as a factor thout helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problem the cyclist faced nowever, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through. Also, in the story you @MONTH1 notices that in the different stages of his struggle, the authours tone ananger from confidient , to unsure, to desser	3	3		3																					
355	3	The cyclist in the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to @CAPS1 national park. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The fist town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with dipleted water, @CAPS2 sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory. He had made it to a bait store for water at last. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again.	2	3		3																					
361	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder. The weather was very hot making him very thirsty and due to the towns being abandoned, he could not stock up on water. The terrain that he had to cross had many hills and the road was not in good condition. With the heat, lack of water, ghost towns, and tough terrains, made his journey a very hard achievement to overcome. With all these obstacles in his way, he was able to achieve his goal of getting water.	2	2		2																					
366	3	The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. The were hills that made his ride difficult. It says, �over one long cripping hill, a bulding came into view.� This shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling. Another thing in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty and becomes he to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ''by the looks of a had beth a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant.� These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
367	3	The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says �have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office� gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite.	2	2		2																					
377	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by their were rolling hills that went up and down and it to alot of streanth and also he barely had water because, it was so hot he kept drinking and ran out of water early. In the story it say when he was riding that � He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down.� This quote shows it was starting to get hot. Also, in the story he says � I checked my water supply.� @CAPS1 means he�s starting to realize his waters running short. So in all the setting is hot abandoned and theirs no water source, so  the cyclist is being affected by all of this	2	2		2																					
378	3	SETTING WAS A IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE STORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT THERE IS A LACK OF WATER. AND ME WAS IN A BIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS. BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR FEET TO MOVE WHICH TAKES OUT ENERGY, AND USES WATER FROM YOUR BODY.	1	1		1																					
379	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was biking up hills in extreme heat. He also had a short water supplyl while head in the wrong direction.	2	2		2																					
381	3	The feachers of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. When she biked around a bend, �my troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me.�	1	1		1																					
385	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, �Do not Exceed posted speed Limit.� By changing him physically. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, �It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting."	3	2		3																					
388	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states �with strong legs and a smile on my face.� As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind�, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean� As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state.	3	3		3																					
389	3	In this story, �No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, by be Joe Kurmaskie I believe the setting greatly affect the cyclist. I believe this because when it�s long downhill cool roads is fine but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he can�t keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around so the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story. Another example	2	2		2																					
390	3	A cyclist is a bike rider. They can be in groups of diffrent people or they can be a solo cyclist. Some cyclist go for a few miles riding there bikes some can go for more like @NUM1 miles, some go over hills, go trow water they do alot with what they do. They have alot of time on there hards to ride a bike that far.	1	1		1																					
395	3	"No water, and no direction effects the cyclist. Water effect cyclist because he said in the essay �I could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie). also no direction is another big one. It is important because without direction he is going to rideing for a long time. In conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story"	2	1		2																					
399	3	In the essay �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first �town� he is not too worried about it and moves on. �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.� @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked �and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.� @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didn�t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the author�s moods.	3	3		3																					
403	3	"In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face� (@NUM1). This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� (@NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely reliefed to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever greatful. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water"	3	3		3																					
406	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road. Lostly, seeing the old welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right infront of you but not business has to make them fell like he/she will never make it. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
407	3	The features in the setting dramaticaly affect the cyclist. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in callada he woudn�t of dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned. An ironic twist �as he calls it. And the last one is hte bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions.	1	2		2																					
408	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel�. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. � From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part.	2	2		2																					
414	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tiered, scared, thirsty and cause him to worry. The setting was a hot California day in June and the cyclist was riding through the heat and over the hills and difficult terrain. The cyclist describes the land when he says, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� He also says, �Over one long, crippling hill.� As the cyclist gets further and further, he has more doubt. Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, �Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, �Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.� The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence	3	3		3																					
427	3	"The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the ""heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. So in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could."	2	3		3																					
429	3	Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.	2	2		2																					
436	3	Setting can affect a cyclsit in many ways. Just as I read in the story, being in a desert dehidrated him. It was hot, the road was bumpy and the dangers of poisnous snakes. The cycclist could have died in many ways such as: heatstroke, falling of his bike, dehidration, and a bite form snake. Say ??? in the mountains of ???.There are many problems that face you there.	1	1		1																					
438	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that they would drink up all of there water because it was hot and they would get ??  thirsty from all of that ???	1	1		1																					
441	3	As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclist�s attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, �with strong legs and a smile on my face�. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men�s travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn�t help but laugh. �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. �At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map.	3	3		3																					
442	3	The cyclist was riding on a rough bumby dangerous road. He had to be on the look out for animals that might try and nort or even kill him. Since he had no water he was de hydrating. Also the road was hot very well taken care of it took more energy to get through it.	1	1		1																					
444	3	The cyclist is out in the desert there for was tired & also running out of water so hes getting dehydrated. 	1	1		1																					
457	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, on page @NUM1, Kurmaskie said � I got down on my hands working the hande of the rusted water pump with all my strength� that shows desperation due to the lack of water.	1	1		1																					
459	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in the high deserts of California where it is very hot so, you need alot of water. Then he needs more water and finds a water pump but cant use the water because it was �some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" Then the terrain in changes when he says �Flat road was replaced "	1	2		2																					
462	3	In the beginning the cyclist was ready to go and happy. By the time he got half way there he was �losing hope�. It was very hot and he was simple alone. By the end, he was relieved because not only did he find water, he found an easier way to get to Yosemite. The first old group of men didn�t help, but the second man did.	1	1		1																					
467	3	In the passage �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� the setting must definetly affects the cyclist. When the cyclist comes for the first abandured �town� he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid �when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� The makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water it is just undrinkable. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist in on his last legs he must work even harder to get water a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,� this quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist most perservere. Also quote �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridicuosly large snake ��tumble weeds and snakes give the feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is what the cyclist is this point. The setting of this story directly correalates with how the cyclist is feeling.	3	3		3																					
468	3	The hot day in June riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experence has made him stronger.	2	3		3																					
471	3	It think  it means  to be all you can be.	0	0		0																					
472	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3. 	2	2		2																					
479	3	In this essay features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite makes it worse. Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn�t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn�t have water he couldn�t funcation as well as if he was hydrated.	2	2		2																					
484	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map. He almost died because he listened to the old men and didn�t look at his map. If the cyclist was in a car mabey he would have better luck because he would be going  faster than the @NUM1 bike.	3	3		3																					
487	3	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically. 	2	2		2																					
488	3	The cyclist in �Rough road Ahead� was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 it�s usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isn�t an easy trick.	1	2		2																					
489	3	The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says �the bulding abandoned years earlier.� If I was him I would of turned around and went back so I would take the chance of not dieing out in the middle of an abandoned area.	1	1		1																					
496	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn�t even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. �The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.� (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.	2	2		2																					
503	3	It affected him by dehydrating him and wearing him down to the point where he was about to give up. But he never gave up. As the end sartisfaction came out of it all.	1	1		1																					
534	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can�t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can�t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn�t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink.	2	3		3																					
536	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily .On top of that he had to pedal a bicicle. So he was thirsty and tired prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
537	3	Setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition. If the road condition is bad then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night. If it is night, they must be careful due to cars not being able to see them. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous to cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water.	1	1		1																					
548	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him. You know he was hot where it said �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.�	1	1		1																					
552	3	The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn�t get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few �tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge,� By the lols of it had been a Welch�s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory.� He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a �Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.� There is only the problems it is abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth. This was to help tabe his mind off being thirst.	3	2		3																					
561	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the hills made it hard for him to ride his bike up and he was afraid of the grass becase it was tall and scary looking.	1	1		1																					
562	3	In the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed limit� a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The rode he is rideing on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there but	2	2		2																					
563	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says ��and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke�� @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote ��ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine.� Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool. 	2	2		2																					
566	3	Heat, hills and ghost towns � all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, the heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke. He starts dinking more often, and nearly runs out of water. Next is the hills. They can take massive amounts of energy to climb. Which adds to his dehydration. Finally the ghost towns. They make his journey seem hopeless. Which could cause him to lose the will to carry on.	2	2		2																					
568	3	In the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the author tells a story about when he took advice from �old folks� and became lost. The setting greatly affected him and his journey, for example �tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake�� and a �crippling hill� these quotes explain that the setting was quite scary.	1	1		1																					
572	3	The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn�t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.	1	1		1																					
573	3	In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows features of the setting played that affects the cyclist in many different ways. A setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking (drinking) water, and worrying that he is going to run out. Kurmaskie writes, � I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in @NUM1). This is what the cyclist gets affected by throuout the whole story as he releizes he could die of heatstroke if he dosent watch how much water hes drinking. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration.	2	2		2																					
574	3	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place things change No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist. Never travel advice home old-timers who haven�th confines of use porches.Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit.	1	1		1																					
576	3	The setting of �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� affect the cyclist so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a desert, in mid- June, with the heat �beginning to beat down� on him. This feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water, but when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself. The cyclist began to realize that he �could trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� @CAPS1, the long distance and changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling, affected him. The distance on which to cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park, consisted of hours and miles of riding. Over vast changes of terrain. The �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills�, which affected the cyclist speed and energy to finish his trip.	3	2		3																					
581	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance the desert is not a hummid making is lack of water a bigger deal than normal. Also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal. In conclusion I temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.	2	2		2																					
590	3	The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn�t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff	1	1		1																					
607	3	When the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence. He biked to the first town but it was like a �ghost town.� A town is a town. soon after that, he did not see anything. No cars, buildings, or anything. He was getting sad and dehydrated. The old men swore there was a town coming up so he put his trust and confidence in him once again. He saw a building  coming up, but it was just an old wore down factory. He thought he was let down. He was sure he was going to die, right there right now. He than saw a siga for a fish comp! He was overjoyed! The place was real to! He thought of them as his savior! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously.	1	2		2																					
613	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. �A rediculously large snake� this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.� I could drop from heat stroke� another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.� There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.� The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.� This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
615	3	"Many things in the setting of the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affected the cyclist throughout his journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a deserts without a good supply of water. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the length of his journey. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
620	3	First, by accepting the old mens� advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would, easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a �ghost town�, lifeless and most importantly, waterless. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like �battery acid�. Next he rides past a �Rough Road Ahead� sign; not the most encouraging thing on his journey. To add to the despair, he has to manever his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp. �To him, this simple bait shop was like  beacon of hope from food himself.	2	3		3																					
621	3	In this story, the cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite, California. In the begining, the cyclist was sure of himself he decided to ask some old men that looked like they haven't been off their porch since Carter was in office for directions. The old men ended up leading him into the middle of the desert. In the desert, the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water. There was no sign of civilization what so ever. These hot conditions made the cyclist very hot, tired, and very thirsty. But that didn't stop him, he kept going and eventually he came apon a little town where he could drink cool water and take a well needed rest. 	2	3		3																					
622	3	Through most the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way. For instance, he makes it to this town a guy swore was there, but it turned out to be abandoned. So he let out a sad, hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, so he hung his head and that blues tune �summer time� rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst. So he stuck some pepples in his mouth to take his mind off it. Then he thought about how lucky he�d be if he checked, @CAPS1 negative to me.	2	2		2																					
624	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, for example, the heat was unberable beating down on him during this long ride. The fact that he had no where around him to fill up his water bottle. So he was deing of thirst and he didn�t know where he was going or how far he had to go. The setting was crushal in this story.	1	1		1																					
626	3	The setting affects the cyclist. He starts to see things that will affect his mind. Passing there is rolling around him he starts to feel abandoned and misled because there are no signs is going to right way.	1	1		1																					
628	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the author goes through many seneries. All of the places that the author goes to make him even more determined because he wants to find water and he just wants to get to Yosemite. The determination pushes him to keep going further and further. And then the determination finally pays off after he goes around a turn because he then see�s a place where he can get something to drink and a place to cool down.	2	1		2																					
636	3	The cyclist and his journey in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit were impacted by the setting. The �deserts of California in June� caused him to be weary very easily. The terrain change from the flat road to hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT Exceed 55 mph. He could only go @NUM1. Finally, the large snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist. All of these features affected the cyclist in some way.	3	2		3																					
642	3	"The setting that were affecting the cyclist was the lack of water he had because it says �the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" and the text also says "" I�ld read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate� he wouldn�t be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasn�t thirsty."	1	1		1																					
648	3	The rider in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider �rode into the morning...with a smile� because of the bright sun, and the �cool pines� and rushing rivers�...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the �ramshackle shed...� And the �...sight of this was troubling...� to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the �crippling hills� that maybe this wasn�t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the �modern bathroom� that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through.	2	2		2																					
651	3	"The essay on ""Rough Road Ahead"" is about the dangers of speed and assault. It�s just letting you know to follow instructions and read signs. You should always keep close @NUM1/= out for signs and things.  "	1	1		1																					
652	3	Setting that affected the cyclist was water tempeter, rolling hills and condition of the roads. Water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started pumping the water it was hot but he took it he tried to let it cool down but it didn�t. Rolling hills was another a tender to the cyclist hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up his can strain the leg and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition, it was smooth at frist then it became rough and rocky. Those was some affects the cyclist had to over come	2	2		2																					
653	3	Setting  depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didn�t. The cyclist  got a bad idea or aditude when he saw the towns he was upset and mad he didn�t want to die and yet he though. He was going two. He said he wouldn�t trust old men anymore. They didn�t know where were talking about .How and why did he trust even in the first place.	2	2		2																					
658	3	The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he�s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a �ghost town� where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn�t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It�s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn�t find water yet. It doesn�t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosen�t find water.	2	3		3																					
666	3	The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. It is an extremely hot now in California while the narrator in aiding his ride. This causes him to become delighted much faster while he is on a �Short hit� leading to no where. �Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from ?? a gorgeous day in June� This gust shows how that calm day really was and the fact the cyclist is sweating so much shows how much the weather is affecting him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling towards up and down no often, it secured his journey. It cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water.The deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply.	2	3		3																					
667	3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal. Before you bike thinkof what conditions are ahead of you	3	2		3

671	3	This essay is an american tale that express how hard it is to do someing. But do it thought determination. The cycle are faced with many change not onnly physically but also menataly. There was no one in sight not a building  or anything. As this rider come to think that the sabstatal beating he took from the ride he is tirde and no sight of baidi say he might not be able to do it.	1	1		1																					
676	3	The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men who�s information was not accurate. Then he cycled along the desert which was very hot. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way. He almost had a heat stroke a few times. He was probably angry that he took these men�s advice and got himself into this. Then when he found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So it�s really confusing because he probably felt relived and mad at the same time. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn�t, the old man would have gave him some more messed up direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke.	3	2		3																					
678	3	"In the short story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story. In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike. Being unware of where he is on his journey the setting begins to really affect him. For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that ""The sight was troubling."" As he continues to California in June the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. For example he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" The quote shows because he is biking so long is looking water and there is not a town is sight he becomes weak and although he is at terminated to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in. "	3	3		3																					
680	3	The feature of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The features in the story changed the speaker�s mood throughout his journey. For example, in the beginning he came across a deserted town so he was cautious. Next, he came across a fork in the road which was troubling to him. Then he passed a snake and had the obstacles of the hills which made him become determined. Finally, his determination changed to relief where he reached Gary and Wilber�s fish camp. In conclusion, the setting in the story greatly affects the cyclist by changing his moods and attitude towards his journey.	2	2		2																					
683	3	Features of the setting such as the hot sun, no water, and �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp,� greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high desserts of California in June, the temperature was really high and the hot sun left �wide rings of dried sweat� on his shirt and made the cyclist realize that he could drop from a heatstroke. Also, the fact that the only water around felt �somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees� and �had the flavor of battery acid� prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a �dehydrated state.� @CAPS1, �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp� affected the cyclist by solving his problem of dehydration, since there was cold water availible for him upon arrival.	2	2		2																					
684	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all, if the cyclist didn�t listen to the old man, he would have never gone through this trouble. Also being that he didn�t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own.	1	2		2																					
685	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist .The setting makes him feel thirsty, dry, hot, and lost. In the story the setting plays a big party in the cyclist's will to ride to the next town. First the cyclist asks directions from a guy that never left his house in decades this creates, doubt. Also in the story it says �Tumbleweeds cross my path� this makes the cyclists feel lost. Finally it say the �water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This makes the cyclist thirsty and tired. The features definatly have an effect on the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
686	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways. He was biking in the middle of the summer in a very hot state of California. This affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated. The roads are very hilly so, he has to use alot more energy to get up the hills. That�s why I think the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed.�   	2	1		2																					
687	3	The cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his ride. First, he was in the �high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 usually brings a picture to my mind of a very dry, hot place. The cyclist had trouble finding water he needed, and thought he might die of heatstroke in the conditions. Also, there were hills. The cyclist said he had to ride over �one long, crippling hill.� From my experiences as a cyclist, hills are the worst part, especially if you�re thirsty. The climate in this story was very hot and dry, and the terrain was full of hills, so altogether, that would make one bad bike ride.	2	2		2																					
705	3	the setting affects the cyclist very strongly in the story because mentally and physically he wasn�t ready for where he was going. For example the text states �No a better, piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never. Accept traver advice from a collection of old timers who wasn�t left the cosines of theer poiches since calter was in office.� So a youg guy took maid advice from older guys about how to get to a pack backin thier day it probably was a shortcut.   	1	1		1																					
707	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.	2	3		3																					
709	3	From the setting that affected the cyclist are possible conditions such as the weather and surrounding enviorment like hills and streams or even tyes of animals and if they are poisenous or not. The setting has and can change the desision a cyclist makes.	1	1		1																					
710	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the hot sun makes the cyclist dehydrated and since there is no water sources around the cyclist is not getting any water. The rough terrain makes the cyclist tired.	1	1		1																					
713	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can�t go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he�s relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn�t really know where he was going because there wasn�t a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first �town� as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and he�s only 12 he knows that he�s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
723	3	The setting effects the rider because if it�s hot you get thirsty and you have no water.This kind of question is hard to answer	1	1		1																					
729	3	Cycling is a very good sport people who do cycling are in shape. Also they have strong calve muscles. I think its also dangerous as well.	1	1		1																					
733	3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness.	3	3		3																					
742	3	In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite. If the setting wouldn't have been so bad, the long ride wouldnt have been as hard on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a California desert, when he did find a well he said, � followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. � @CAPS1 thing about the setting is, if it wouldnt have been so hot, he wouldnt have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said �  I  could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. � In conclusion, the setting played a major role in the story.	2	1		2																					
746	3	The riders condition was rough, from flat land to rolling hills. This would be hard for some one who is dehydrating. There was a snake in his path so he went around it. This would be dangerous he could blackout from lack of water and then get bit by the snake.	1	1		1																					
749	3	"The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and their is no where to go. An example from the test is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. Thats what affected the cyclist the heart the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most all no directions."	2	1		2																					
752	3	I think that the setting made him find more courage inside him self to save his water and go to the next town with out any water.	1	1		1																					
754	3	"As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that be lovers, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confidentin the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted.Though at first he laughs it off, he laster realizes just how much trouble he in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates. All there features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point.      "	3	3		3																					
755	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because every thing that was happing years ago are happen now in todays world meaning wars. Rights & etc todays feature is the same. Every thing is repeating it�s self.	0	0		0																					
756	3	When riding a bike it @MONTH1 not seem to hard. For a cyclist every thing becomes more serious. The determination to win and be the best even if it kills you. In this essay he under estimates the dder cyclist. When really they are the people with more knowledge. Some of the things that @MONTH1 be hard for cyclist are the rough roads. Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke. As road get worse chances get higher tumble weeds and snakes in the way, he was determined to win. After all was said and he faced the horror that nature brought him he knew he was wrong wrong for them and the intelligants.	2	3		3																					
768	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California.� This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse at minute from heat exaustion. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
772	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states �This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town.� This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
779	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of he setting affect how the author feels. In the beginning of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is, �a reservoir camp ground outside at Lodi, California� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, �This sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, �Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me� (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The area the author goes through has an effect"	2	3		3																					
788	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. First since he was in a desert, the heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his journey to the parts. Also, the bumpy roads and rolling hills slowed the bike down to 12 mph since it was to extreme for him to handle at high speeds. When he sees the fist building because he fist is relived but soon after he loses all his hope because it is desserted. Even the old men that living in the area have an affect on the cyclist because they give him out-dated directions that almost @CAPS1 him. Because of this, he will probably rest first an old man�s short tentS again. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
792	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s essay �Rough Road Ahead,� the speaker is biking through some rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention long distances. He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the Welch�s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen� (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey.	2	2		2																					
796	3	The setting was a hot desert in California that a biker got stuck in going to Yosemite National Park. These settings were hard on the cyclist. For example, he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed. He was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off. All of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though. He learn that just because they are old and looks wise they have information probably older than the artifacts at a museum. Besides he has a trust map: He got a lot from this trip.	2	2		2																					
809	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he first didn�t know where he was going and took directions from people that he wasn�t really sure about. It was hot he was running out of water he had no idea where he was there were snakes. His water was running out. there were no sings he kept thinking that he would never take directions from an old guys and that he would stick to the future.	1	1		1																					
810	3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town he�s tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he�s tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He�s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is greatful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story the cyclists needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relived.	2	3		3																					
820	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuiou	3	2		3																					
821	3	"The setting acts as a catylist in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is always challenging the character untill the very end. In the story it says �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says �The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.� This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him it also shows how is risle he is, and how satiricle life can be. The ultimate @CAPS1 in this story is when he stumbels across the welches grape juice factory and there was a piture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.� No matter where the cycalist goes he is alway trying to overcome the elements."	2	3		3																					
823	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because it�s hot, and than theres no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� (@NUM1.). This exert from the test supports my previous statement about how it�s hot because the speaker tells us how he�s sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage. �There was no one insight not a building, car, or any structure of any kind� (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance.	2	2		2																					
829	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined.	1	1		1																					
830	3	In the story, the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1�s Fish camp, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclist�s attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not.	3	3		3																					
837	3	Many of the settings features affect the cyclist. One of the features of the dessert like, which is the setting, is the dry air and hot temperatures. This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, �I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.� @CAPS1 feature of the setting was the desolet towns that didn�t contain any water. This lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to sucking on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulates. @CAPS1 features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch�s Grape factory. This  factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state. The narrator called the factory.�Ironic  twist.�	3	3		3																					
838	3	The effects from the setting that has an effected on me is that while riding on the bike in hot weather with only a little bit of water to drink because I would have giving up have nothing to drink. The water had to be hot.In the text it sayed �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�, I don�t think I could have lasted long, if I was dehydrated. From the look of it I would have drop dead of heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
842	3	When the cycleist mentions how hot and dry and open the terrain is, it makes me feel like he is in the desert. I also know that it�s hot because he is swreating and dehydrated.	1	1		1																					
847	3	The features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony. As the cyclist continues down his path he pasts through a ghost town, then twenty mile up the road he sees a ramshackle shed & some rusty water pumps. He attempts to get water out because he was runing out but all he could get was muck, then what he described as �water feeling two-hundred degrees, it had the flavor of battery acid. Further down the road was a sign that said rough road ahead, adhere to the posted speed limit of 55, he was going 12 mph. Even worse he found an abandoned juice factory on the way, at that point he was out of water.	2	2		2																					
848	3	Do not Exceed posted speed limit, never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confinses of their porches sin Carter was in the office twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork as sorrs. I got down on my hands and kness, working the handle of the rasted water pump with all my strength. The water bottles contained only a few totalt and sips. He could or been sad person. And he could just be a bum.	2	1		2																					
852	3	After reading �Do not Exceed Posted Limit� I have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who tell him a bad shortcut. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. �that mood� was replaced by short, moving hills.� The cyclist could not er nuertecy tried everything, not showing how long he have to continue going up and down. There at one point he says, �@CAPS1 can feel so cruel.� There, he is upset because a road sign come up through acid tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also. When you take a short cut in life, there are always consciences as you decide to drop out of high school is go on how with your journal, where is always the posibility of is not working, and where you cry with no diploma ?? and he gets a job	3	3		3																					
853	3	In the short story, Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting effects the cyclist in the story. For example, the dry hot air begins to  slowly dehidrate him, causing the cyclist to lose all sense of reason, the heat also played tricks on his mind. Also, the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them. This, also with the heat factor, caused him to use up his much needed water supply. The setting in this story deeply effects the cyclist. 	2	2		2																					
854	3	Features from the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in he was in had a major affect. He was in cali. which is a big dessert. In the middle of some it is very hot. Bike riding on roads in the dessert with no trees or shade of any sort is quet harsh. And to be riding around where there is not much civilazation as to where you can�t get water is a major issue.	1	1		1																					
855	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there is poisonous snake out thre. Your the only person ridin dow those hills all by your self. The guy had said that the next town was @NUM1 miles from where he was at. The lack of water that there were not any streams or rivers around there just in a desert with nothing.	1	1		1																					
857	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, your in the desert cycling for many hours very hot and only have limited water. This affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park. Anothe example, is that you are going up and down rolling hills and you legs get very tired so they don�t want to move any more. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you and your sweating so much and @MONTH1 be seeing thing but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
858	3	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become deyhdrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water.	1	1		1																					
861	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him hot and thristy most of his way. As he rode he started to get tired slowly and he got work and more thirsty. He drank his water at first with out thinking to much or it, but as he went on he slowly found himselfs trying to conseve it. By the time he got to the second wild town the will he was so thirsty and tired thathe thought it might of been a ""death"" So he wiped the sweat from his eyes."" to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when the are hot,tired, and about to kill for some water. This is what the cyclist was like after his long jouney to Yosemite National Park with the directions given by old men."	2	1		2																					
862	3	The features of the setting include �There are no one in sights, not a building, car, or structure of any kind which describes the trail the cyclist was taking. These features of the setting describe how the cyclist is affected because it elaborates on his doubting whetther he will survive or not.	1	1		1																					
865	3	The features setting in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn�t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and how much he could ride.	1	1		1																					
868	3	To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would about @NUM1� outside and sunny. You can�t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move in the snow. You can�t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could getin a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you be able to ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride.	1	1		1																					
876	3	The features of the setting put an affect on the cyclist. The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds, and a ridiculously large snake. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play.	2	2		2																					
882	3	In the story it explained the beauty of the night, also about the outdoors and how it is effecting his trip. The features of the setting effects the cyclist, because the setting was mild, sounded warm and calm. Also it showed how it contains to us. The setting was similar to the cyclist. That�s how the features of the setting effects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
883	3	The cyclist was in California in June, the sun was beating down on him this made the ride difficult with short water supply The man came upon several towns that were abandond which made his water supply less. The terrain was long and straight then turned into tall hills which had to be difficult to ride.	1	2		2																					
886	3	The cyclist had a couple of affects in his journy. One of them was he hills the it was a problem because it used most of his energy and slowed him down. The other one was water, the lack of water. If the had enerf water he would have gotten a boost that would have kept him going.	2	1		2																					
898	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed� by @PERSON1 the settings of the story effects the rider in manyways. The first and most obvious is the temperature, it is hot, therefore the rider is hot and becoming dehydrated making him thirsty. A second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him. Since nothing is around him there is no where for him to get water adding to the affect of dehydration making him more thiristy. The rider says �One ran shacle shed, sevral rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn�t hold the lamestmal egreeted me. ''This statement from the author support the factt that nothing is around. Onemore feature of the setting that affected the rider was the hills. The hills made the rider tired requiring more pedalind and wearing him out, the setting features had agreat afect on the rider from heat and dehydration to hills and energy. onething that the setting didnt have was a positive affected on the rider.	2	2		2																					
899	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist. It was a hot June day and the water supplies he had was running out. He got the wrong directions homThese old men so he would had to ride  his bike longer than he had to and he would need water from pedaling all that way for nothing. Since he was going in the wrong direction there were no buildings for him to get water, there were no people so he couldn�t communicate and there would be no one to call for help incase he was over heated from the heat.	2	2		2																					
909	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,� That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.� This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
913	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist for these reasons. It says �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling.� That showshow how the features affected the cyclist because he says the sight was troubling. It  troubled him because he wanted water and he seen the rusty pumps that reminded him of water but he new their was no water or it was nasty	1	1		1																					
915	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist, on his way to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the rough deserts of California. As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, as is the sand. There is no water anywhere and dangerous, highly venomous creatures are abundant. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grope juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere. Until, finally, he reaches a modern area and drinks from the sink in the bathroom.	2	2		2																					
917	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places starting off with this man took advice from many older men, which don�t even know the area anymore. So riding through this man seems lost, he is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas. He starts out good, then comes to a �Rough Road� and he even says �sometimes life can feel so cruel�. Then he come to this large snake in the middle of the road scary enogth he has to slow ride past this thing taking up most of the road. Coming over these thing was very strong and hard of this young man.	2	3		3																					
922	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he�s in the middle of nowhere with no water. The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.� This quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car. 	2	1		2																					
925	3	�Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from �old timers� the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that�s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn�t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn�t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn�t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. 	3	3		3																					
930	3	Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, ��The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him.	2	2		2																					
932	3	The feature's of the setting affect the cyclist because the condition's he is in without any water. the cyclist would be fine if he would have had more water for his trip. He ran out of water not to for into  his journey thanks to the heat of the setting he was in. the cyclist makes this statement. I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June�. The cyclist is saying that since it is so  hot where he is he has to take regular drinks of water so he stays highdrated throughout is trip. It is also saying that in the mountians with less air and how hot it is he is not doing as well as he thought he would on the trip.	1	2		2																					
936	3	The features  of the setting affect the cyclist in that it made him use up his water supply and tested his determination. � Sometimes life can be so cruel� implies that he was having a horrible time coping with the setting he was in. To himself he thought be was gonna die at any moment.	1	1		1																					
939	3	At First the narrator in Do not Exceed  Posted Speed limit was energetic enthusiastic  about their journey to Yosemite national Park .After getting some helpful advice about a few short cuts the cyclist sets out for adventure .First thing they encounter is ghost town .The gentlemen they a taken advice from had assured them it was booming prosperous town .This set the first wave of doubt through the cyclist mind .Then lack of water began .They were travelling through the high desserts of California in June and slowly running out of water .Flat road was soon replaced by short , rolling hills which only increased the cyclist state deliriousness .After a few more dissapointments the cyclist decides there is no hope and they are going to die .The reader is partly drawn in believing that this is the end for the cyclist .All of the disappointments set the stage for the end of the cyclist and you can�t stop reading because you have to find out what happens.If it weren�t for the hopelessness of the setting you wouldn�t care.	3	2		3																					
940	3	When the cyclist is going on his trip, he is riding through as desert. All he sees the entire journey is a flat rode and dirt. He is riding on the road; hopelssly hoping for some form of lif. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. �The author is trying to be positive but it�s hard, because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert. Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn�t be that worried, there�s water and shade. He has none of that in the desert. This whole journey was all mental. He always kept in his mind that everything would be ok. That is what helped him survive. This is an ispiring story, to anyone who needs a push to stey optionistic.	2	2		2																					
947	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. For example, the story said,""I gathered up a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth"" This quote explains that the setting was very and had pebbles. The setting benefiting him by taking the thrist off his mind. If their wasn't any pebbles by the cyclist he @MONTH1 not have made it. In cocnlusion in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the cyclist was benefited by the features of the setting."	1	1		1																					
952	3	"In the short story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays an extremely important role. The story takes place in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling around 12 mph. the heat made his dehydration situation much worse.  �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� The cyclist was losing hope, yet he was still determined to find water. This setting was very important to the story, for if it had taken place at @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, it would not have made sence. The setting contributes to the story by raising the intensity of the situation."	2	2		2																					
954	3	The features of this story tend to affect the cyclist very much. Because he took a shortcut he had an even longer journey than before. He was in the middle of no where with barley any water left and on top of all that he�s exhausted from all the hills on the terrien. So because he took a shortcut it ending up costing him in the long run.	1	1		1																					
959	3	All the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strerigth. It seems like he might have collapsed it he hadn't thought he was going to @CAPS1, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him.	2	2		2																					
962	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, his body heat raised a good bit. They don�t come out and say it, but they do say, �The sun was beginning to beat down.� We all know that it your out side when it�s hot, you get hot too. It also probably added to his dehydryeon. As a long distance running, I know what the sun will do to you during a hot day. That is how the setting affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
965	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening. His water supply got drank quickly and he couldn�t find a town near. He was in the desert-like California, and the sun was beating down on him. When he did one town, it was more of a �ghost town�, and had rusted pumps that had battery-oil tasting liquid. Every person he asked told him is near, but from dehydration, it took him longer. the roads got windy and small hills occurred. There was a large snack in the middle of the road, as the tumble weed blew by. the finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down.   	2	2		2																					
971	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because It give it more life. More meaning and make I fun to read.	0	0		0																					
980	3	I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, �I could drop from heatstroke�. Meaning, its really hot! Also, l think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him because it says in the passage, �l eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�. This has a big affect on him, because he�s very thirsty. Also, l think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars. I think all these things affect him.	2	2		2																					
984	3	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One reason was that he was in the desert. Like in the quote �through high deserts of California. This means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke. Then he couldn�t even get any water. Like on the quote �of the rusted water pump.� it was describing how old it was then the cyclist got some out but it tasted like old battery acid. Therefore the features and setting afected The cyclist.	2	1		2																					
987	3	"In the essay �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldn�t hold in the lamest mule.� This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
1005	3	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.	1	1		1																					
1008	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist is affected by the setting mently and physicly. For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don�t think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way	2	2		2																					
1012	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s, �Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� there are several features that effect the cyclist. �..and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie) Deserts in June are extremely hot and dry and caused the cylist to become dehydrated quickly. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The change from flat lands to hills made the ride more strenuous on the cyclist. These conditions directly affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1019	3	All the features of the settings affect his rythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can. Instead of thinking about it. If I was him I would just ride my bike & think about I thing winning!	1	1		1																					
1026	3	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist. Now the setting is in the california desert on a hot day in sane wich caueses the cyclist to drink all of his water wich later malice him dehydrated. The barren desert with no landmarks causes the cyclist to become lost wich is the main problem with the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1032	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The author is getting worn out and is rapidly running out of water. He �was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. This shows how the setting is causing him to become greatly exhausted.	1	1		1																					
1034	3	The setting of �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of louage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there. �I got down on my hands, and knees, working,the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength. He was so thirst and tired he didn�t know how else to get some water	1	1		1																					
1035	3	"In the setting the young man is faced  by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person. For example he was proud of himself he mad himself happy by saying at the end ""yes sir! I own a very good map"". He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supplie of water to get to where he was determined to be Yosemite."	1	2		2																					
1036	3	"The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because it�s a dry area in California in June. The cyclist really needs water which is the main thing affecting him besides the fact that he�s lost in a ghost town. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed."	1	1		1																					
1040	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, �The sun was beginning to beat down�, the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�, California�s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exguasted and dehydrated. 	2	3		3																					
1043	3	In the poem �Do not exceed speed limit� the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says �At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake� This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read �Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.	1	1		1																					
1046	3	The setting in the essay �Rough Road Ahead� makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was �traveling through the high desert of California in June� this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal.	2	3		3																					
1048	3	The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� affect the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The fact that there was nothing around him, made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he�s going to die. He shows that he�s lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from �old-timers who haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving.	3	2		3																					
1051	3	The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectaculiar and amazing like. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasn�t what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story.	1	1		1																					
1053	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the @LOCATION1, where it�s nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. He�s excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch�s Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again.	2	3		3																					
1057	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the bad condition roads. The was also hills so they made it harder for the cyclists.	1	1		1																					
1058	3	�There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. This adaodoness makes it hard for the cycleist to frot hope and threes as where to get water. �I could drop from a heat strote in a gorgeous day in June, hes in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around no one this make's him very desperate since hes adaodoned.	1	2		2																					
1066	3	The features of the setting in this story gives the cyclist determination. Since the desert	1	1		1																					
1071	3	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they�re water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest.	1	1		1																					
1072	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1073	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, �A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didn�t have much to drink until the next town. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills� (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen� (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted.	3	2		3																					
1074	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn�t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn�t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn�t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn�t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn�t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don�t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better.	3	2		3																					
1086	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advise from people that no longer drive or even leave of the porch would be unuseful. When the author say �old timers who haven�t lest the confined of them porches since carter was in office� that what he is explaining. He then say �I rode  into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face� he was refering back to how hes  on the rode  alone riding the bike and theres not a car insight any where around. The curbs of the turns where so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safe as he did �He whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn�t mirage and tried not get to excited� @CAPS1 in this situation would have made many people excited about the long lonely cicle by his self.	2	2		2																					
1094	3	The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because, he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehygrated it's not healthy and you die from it. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down,along with the sweat. As long as he has some lijid left, it should be ohang. 	1	1		1																					
1096	3	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If it�s too hot, you�re going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If it�s all down hill, it�s really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out. Features of the setting really affect a cyclist	2	1		2																					
1100	3	"The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people. When he got into the first town he had ran out of water to drink but the towns water he was in now tasted like battery acid so that�s not safe to drink. As he started to head out the scenery changed. �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore."	2	2		2																					
1105	3	While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listen to some old  men who gave him directions for a shortcut.When he began his trip everything was fine.But then he found that along the �shortcut� there was no building.By the time he figured out that the old men were mistake he had almost run out of water.There was nothing around that he could drink.He was getting very thirsty.The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn�t make his task any easier.About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills, which made his trip even harder.Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his strength to get to it just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory.This made going without water much harder as well as he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice.In the end he finally make it to a pait shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could	3	3		3																					
1108	3	The features in the story affect the cyclist by not having anything to drink. The person was going to a place far away with out any food or water for miles. He could have died. There is anther feature the effects the cyclist, and that is no one is around for miles. If he died out there, no one would no know for days. I know this because in the story he said � There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. ''That says it all, the last feature is that it was hot. I know this because it says ''I was travelling through high deserts of California in June.'' It is hot is June, and it is even hotter in California.	2	2		2																					
1111	3	Since the cyclist was really thirsty, the setting was not very appealing considering it was a desert. You could tell she was stressing because she was sweating and having a trouble time trying to pedal.	1	1		1																					
1117	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated and hot. He was in deserts on a bicycle with his water support running low and rough road with plenty of hills to make it hard for a bike to out come. he kept going though the heat was outrageous and dehydration beginning to overcome him.	2	1		2																					
1118	3	I think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going. He can reach the place without water but that is not a good thing to do.	2	2		2																					
1121	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how everychange happened. For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldn�t feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.	1	1		1																					
1122	3	After sometime into his trip he mentioned �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I believe that this setting had gotten him determined to keep on pedaling so he could live. But then he started to think he might die, but he wasnt sad or upset, he was happy. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the fact that he might die because he listend to some old men. In my opinion I think he was having the time of his life peddeling through this setting of California.	1	1		1																					
1143	3	The setting is in a California which isn�t really the coolest of places to be.[temperature]	1	1		1																					
1149	3	"The setting of the essay �Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" is very dry, sandy, hot, and deserted. On his way to Yosemite he takes a �short cut"" from so he do me through the desert. When he first leaves its in a hot and flat part of the desert. His mood is high and her has confidence. �Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile of my face.� With this he arrives at the first �town� but hes wasn�t worried he had bad plenty of water he moves on. The terrain starts working against him in his search for water, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills a large high way sign jumped out at he. It read: Rough Road Ahead : Do not Exceed posted speed limit.� This lowers his confidence, especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke no one would he around to find him. He keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on. When he see the first comp he is overwhelmed  with relief and the terrain flattens out again. When asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest. He can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions."	3	3		3																					
1154	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that if it�s hot and your riding a long way you need a lot of water so you don�t  dehydrated. Also it can affect your vision cause you looking at the sun. Another way cyclist can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape it can affect the way they ride there bike.	1	1		1																					
1155	3	 The story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1 had some statements that we were kind of pointless to put in. One of sentence in the essay had a couple word that don�t need to be used. In the sentence, about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first �town,� I don�t think �into the pedal needs to be in there because its not describing anything.	1	1		1																					
1157	3	The settings of the story is very desert like what I mean by that is its the desert and its hot and he really had to push his self to make it. The condition at the rode are very rough and has a lotof shape turn it in. Apart in the story he gets a boost of energy and pedal as hard as he can down a hill and then relaxes. This is the setting and is summary of the story.	0	0		0																					
1158	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the condition of his surrounding it was hot so he got dehydrated more and needed more water. There were a lot of hills so he had to pedal harder and use more energy to get up the hills. There were no cars, building, smog, just nature. It was peaceful and relaxful ride on the bike thats the setting affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1159	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June.Their is also a lack of water, some must pace his sips carefully. Therefore also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life.  The dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist. His journey does teach you though, that trough determination you will be rewarded. You have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to get success.	3	3		3																					
1169	3	In the short story, �Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, expresses the features of the setting like the lack of water, and can not find help to the end affects the cyclist in the story. During his time of need the cyclist says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom.� The cyclist has a lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall down; giving up on hope. When the cyclist finds hope, �And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.� The cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive. The cyclist should not have taken the old peoples advice for granted, but will now look onto people�s sense of directions.	3	3		3																					
1170	3	Setting affects many things in stories. The setting in this story affected the cyclist. The setting was very hot and it slowed him do wn a lot. For example he said he was doing 55 miles	1	1		1																					
1173	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldn�t get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake.� They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted �I eased past.� When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist�s journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other �GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, we�re your BEST BET.""The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect. These are features that had an affect on the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1176	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, he cannot get water and becomes dehydrated, then, he goes on a rough ride and loses more energy. Then he finds the bait and gets water. All of these greatly affect the cyclists condition.	1	1		1																					
1179	3	In the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn�t have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated.	3	3		3																					
1180	3	The features of the setting was affect the cyclist by disturb them to ride in road, limite their speed, and make their distance longer than the original travel plan. For example, the features at the setting was disturb the cyclist to ride in road because it tells them where they can go and where they can�t and they shouldn�t do this or that such as the sign of �no entering� or �one way�. Second, it�s limite their speed because if the features of the setting it said the limited speed is @NUM1, the cyclist only can ride about @NUM1 and go no more further which can make the cyclist longer time to reach the place that they want to go and couldn�t travel faster. Third, it make their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or how fast they can rode. Such as the sign of �Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit�. Therefore, the features of the setting was affect the cyclist during the journal.  	1	1		1																					
1183	3	No water, rough terran, bad info-all are reasons why the boy isn�t doing so well I said no water because he is dehidrated but needs to soae his water. Also he could die from heat exauston. I also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help. And to top it off he took info from old people that didn�t know what they were talking about. Theas leave all examples about the essay that support my writing.	2	2		2																					
1191	3	When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite he stumbled into a million setting. One in the begining when he was talking to the old men on the porch and having him set of into the distance of nothing but dessert. �one rameshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� It�s only him.� At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like ma diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Tumble weed usually mean's desert. He also saw the @CAPS1 grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions.	1	2		2																					
1192	3	In the story rough road ahead the cyclest is affected by the setting in many ways. Because he was in a desert in June it was very hot, so he got thirsty. Also because of the heat he could have dehydration of heat strokes. Lastly because it was a desert the wild animals like the snakes and lizards could hurt or posion him and he could die that is how the setting of the story affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1194	3	"In the passage DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the desert�s feature did not have any positive affects on the cyclist. The desert contained ""rolling hills."" When a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity. Because the cyclist used more energy to go over the hills he only had enough energy to ""feel sorry"" for himself. The more hills, the more energy lost, the more tired he became. The desert was also hot, and dry. Obviously, since he was in the ""deserts of California in June."" @CAPS1 the would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water but a ""tarlike substance"" came out instead. When he again stopped later for water it was ""cool"" and most likely refreshing. Riding his bike in the hilly, dry, hot desert the cyclist became tired and thirsty."	3	2		3																					
1204	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn�t stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn�t know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasn�t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldn�t cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey.	2	2		2																					
1205	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. First the rolling hills make it hard to pedal over the land. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" shows that the terrain was changing into a more difficult course. One long crippling hill,"" also shows how the hills had an effect on the cyclist. Another feature of the setting was the desert and the high temperatures. This caused the cyclist to become dehydrated. ""Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state"" and ""I could drop from heatstroke"" show me how hot the cyclist was. One final feature that has on effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive. ""I hung my head"" and ""abandoned factory of juices and dreams"" tell how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building. All of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1209	3	The fatures of the setting affects the cyclist because in the story the character makes it seem like horrible weather for example when he said �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt� this is one way the setting affects the cyclist because it almost like your in the story and you can imagton what the character Is going through because everything is written in details.	1	1		1																					
1212	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness then it motivates you more. Than when there is a lot en stuff around you.	0	0		0																					
1218	3	The setting in the short story �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie is troubling to the cyclist �One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the tamest mule greeted me,� made him troubled that he was in the middle of nowhere. The quote, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� shows that he was troubled by having to go over the hills. As you can see the setting was very influental to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1220	3	The features of the setting around the cyclist affected him to the point of exauhstion and dehydration. The cycllist being exauhsted and dehydrated,or tired and thirsty, was beging to wear as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs. The cyclist exlained the change by saying, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist�s idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hill of this californian desert rollar coaster. His water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud.	2	2		2																					
1222	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclistis affected by his surrounding. At first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground. His confidence is high, and he is ready to continue his adventure. As the day went on and all he could find was abondoned buildings he began to worry a bit water running low he come upon �one ram shackled shed, several rusty pumps� no sign of life. He realiced that his trip was going to be rough. The environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, he knew �travelling through the high deserts of California in June� his only chances of survival was to keep going. The mans surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp. If he had not been so aware of his surroundings he might have given up, but not making it out of the desert to �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite� would be to devastating	1	2		2																					
1223	3	The setting affects the rider because it is very hot wich makes him thirsty. how long the road witch affect his mind state and last the fact that ??? is in sight and that affect is coral	1	1		1																					
1228	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he rode through the heat scorching desert of California, he rode over @NUM1 miles on bike to get to Yosemite, and he almost ran out of water on the journey. What kept him going on was the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.	1	1		1																					
1231	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn�t have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn�t bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldn�t see anything in sight.	3	3		3																					
1236	3	There were many features of the setting that had affected the cyclist. One of the features was the lack of water. This had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right. It had also made the cyclist have less energy. An example is, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� @CAPS1 feature is the heat. The heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty. An example is �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� @CAPS1 example is, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The features of the setting had affected the cyclist in many ways.	2	2		2																					
1239	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1240	3	he wouldn�t know he would be faceing while rider or the road @MONTH1 be something bad might happen to his bike or one of his bike�s wheels or he might fall of his the bick he would set so tired that he can�t go any more he might give it up	1	1		1																					
1244	3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn�t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.�� You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them.	3	2		3																					
1257	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. If the road is rough you have to have the right bike. Then if you get a flat tire you have to know to look out for dangerous and posionous things. If you were in a real bad accident you�d have to be prepared just in case they don�t find you in time. You would have to know what nights were like. For example, if it got real cold at night you need to keep youself warm.	1	1		1																					
1262	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in the story. In the story, it says, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. I could drop from a heatstroke.� This statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding, water was very hard to find and scare. He is talking about how he will die if he doesn�t get water. Another example is that there are no buildings around and is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads. In the story it says, �the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. This means that he was partially all by himself and he had no one to go to.	2	2		2																					
1267	3	"During the cyclist journey in �Rough Road Ahead� by joe Kurmaskie he expierences setting changes such as the road being flat then going to short rolling hills. When hes wrideing he says the road is flat. �Flat road was replaced"" This tells us the road he was on was nice and flat. Then as hes rideing he notice the land change.� Flat road was replaced by, short rolling hills.� this tells us that the cyclist will have more trouble sence the terrain changed. That�s how the land changes  "	1	1		1																					
1269	3	As the author of the story goes on her bike trip, the landscape around her becomes less and less welcoming. The first thing the cyclist encounters is a rusty pump & old shed. When the cyclist tries to get water from the pump, she describes the water as very hot and not cooling down at all. When the cyclist continues, tumble weeds that look like �diamond head snakes� cross her path. She encounters no buildings for a long time when she does encounter a building, It is abandoned and suggests that people left because of the landscape. The cyclist encounters another elderly man in her journy but decides not to take his advice because of the path the last set of elderly men set her down. 	2	2		2																					
1271	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, they ware heat, lack of water, and hills. While on his journey he almost gets dehydrated because he does not have a good supply of water and he said they taste �like battery acid.� And he had to convince up the road for anothe @NUM1 miles so that he could finally replenish himself	1	1		1																					
1276	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the roads are bumpy. The other things that is effecting the cyclist is the water on the roads. There are a lot of curved roads which always slows down his speed.	1	1		1																					
1280	3	The setting affect the cyclist in many gruding and harsh was. First, the lack of civilization contributes to an uneasy feeling and an inability to refill his water bottle. Second, the heat and uphill bottles are taking their tollon both aplists physical and mental strength. Third, his water bottle is emptying at an alarming late due to his third and relentless heat. In paragraph four die exospodent cyclist reaches the first ''town.'' This place @MONTH1 have been a striving spell but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of ghost down.� @CAPS1 he came to house with a rusty water pump, which sped out brackish, near boiling water, which did not support the porched cyclist, physically, on mentally.	2	2		2																					
1283	3	"In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert make him need alot of water resources. This is because the heat and exercise will dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he is desperate enough to try to drink out of an old pump that had black sludge in it. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.  "	1	1		1																					
1286	3	Well some features might have more than others and the cyclist might have more than others. Also the author faced alot of problems like the lack of water, the poisonous snakes and the condition of the road. So there were many thing that affected the author and the cyclist, when they were on there journey.	2	2		2																					
1288	3	There is many things that could have made his bycicle ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasn�t in the middle of no where and if he actually knew where he was. For example, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� There, he had almost no water to get him through the day. For instance, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him. In conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard.	2	2		2																					
1291	3	The feature of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, �over one long crippling hill, a building came into view� This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.� This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn�t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don�t make a life-threating choice.	3	2		3																					
1304	3	Riding through beastly mountains, hot and burning deserts and no water. A cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions. The two old men gave him the wrong directions and send him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through. First he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion. Maps are made for people to use so if you have a map you should trust it and in the ending it shows that the cyclist learned that because he said �And I promised myself right then that I�d always stick to it in the future.�	3	3		3																					
1307	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY DEPLETING HIS WATER SUPPLY, AND ALMOST GIVING HIM HEAT EXHAUSTION. IN THE TEXT, HE SAYS: THE WATER BOTTLES CONTAINED ONLY A FEW TANTALIZING SIPS.� THIS HOTNES HE HAS LITTLE WATER LEFT FOR SURVIVAL UNTIL HE RUNS OUT.	1	1		1																					
1316	3	In the short story �Do not @CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. In the story the cyclist experiences many changes in temperature and climate. He also experiences changes in land structure which makes it extremely hard to pedal and get where he needs to. From my reasoning is why the setting @MONTH1 affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1317	3	The hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination. The sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination. �The sun was begining to beat down...wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.� By him being so hot and tired fromthe sun, he thought that he would die from dehydration. This would very likely stop him from making it to his destination, Yosemite. His lack of water supply didn�t help the situation either because he could only go @NUM1, was �water depleting @NUM2.�	2	1		2																					
1327	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him ???  are ??? like when he rood through that ghost town. The setting is a big part of this story thats all that talk about. And when hes getting water or how the tumbleweeds are crossing the road. He was all ways thirsty and rode his bike along ways and is no paint in ??? ??? ???.	2	2		2																					
1328	3	How the setting changes the mood of the cyclist is that what he sees pretty much discribes how he feels. Like he starts off with strong less and a smile on his face. Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town, that didn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it he laughs. Also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old men's direction giving. Like at the first town he still has confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that it starting to get hotter but that doesn�t change his mood much. @NUM1 miles later comes top a fork in road with rusty water pumps and a ran down car all that makes him less confidence in water level. Then he realizes the next town is a long way away so he losse more confidence and gets more worried about water. Then the flat road is replaced with rough road so his mood goes down more. Then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up. Here is how the setting affected his mood.	2	3		3																					
1329	3	The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke. Also his lack of water made him extreamly tired as he petaled. Next the sun was beating down so not only was he tired due to his lack of water but also because of it being so hot out he was loosing water and energy from his sweat. Thats why the features and setting made his journey to YoSemite difficult.	2	2		2																					
1332	3	The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In �Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says �Over one long, crppling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1333	3	Heat, dessert, humidity � all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey. First, heat because the heat is making him thirsty for water @CAPS1 he is running row on. For example, the narrator describes, �� water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips.� This means that the day is hot and running out of water. Second, dessert because the narrator is the only one around and deserts are usually diserted. For example the narrator exclaims �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind.� @CAPS1 clearly states that he could be in a dessert where no one wants to be. Lastly, humidity, because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seen hotter than it usually is. This is why heat, dessert, and humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as he is on a journey.	2	2		2																					
1335	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn�t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1�. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn�t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber�s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who �haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting.	1	1		1																					
1336	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.� Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California in deserts. Finally he sees bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all. Based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map. 	2	2		2																					
1342	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way could be if the setting was in, like, a place with a lot of water, then the cyclist wouldn�t have to worry about dehydration. Another reason would be if the old men were never outside in the first place, then none of this would have also happened.   	1	1		1																					
1345	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder. In paragraph @NUM1; there is a senteance that says, �It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� In the next paragraph the cyclist comments, �sometimes life can feel so cruel.� @CAPS1 because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water and rolling hills are all obsticules in life, people have to experience. We might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful.	2	2		2																					
1353	3	The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the rode. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future. So he�s keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future.	1	1		1																					
1360	3	The feature in the setting affeted the cyclist alot. It was a hot summer day and he was running out of water. With oll the heat he could have had a heat stroke. Another problem was the hills. He didn't have alot of energy, ?? the sun were tiding it from him.	1	1		1																					
1373	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist�s attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old mens directions he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delicious, the setting had added severly to the problem. The beating sun and high desserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he come to a rusted water pump �black tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions.	3	2		3																					
1374	3	The cyclist in �Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� starts off in the �serenity of an easly summer evening� taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn�t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his �short cut� was not so short after all. The �high deserts of California in June� and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he�d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a �Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.� @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  	3	3		3																					
1376	3	The features mentioned in the settings of the story made it harder for the cyclist. The lack of water during a summer in California  made it very uncomfortable for the cyclist to go through the deserts. The worst part was when he tried to suck the pebbles to cycle his saliva in his mouth, he ended up swallowing one.	1	1		1																					
1378	3	I think that if we where to inforce the punishments on those who speed that there wuold be less car crashes really those that have bad road rage shuold be in anger management	0	0		0																					
1385	3	The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he�s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, �I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn�t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, �yes- sir: I own a very good map.� @CAPS2 by this he�s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he�ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed.	3	2		3																					
1386	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says �neihbor hood of two hundred degrees.� He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far.	1	1		1																					
1388	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, depending how the main character feels, that�s what the setting is like. When he got the next town and left he was feeling well because nothing was going wrong. The setting was very tranquil. The narrator says, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them�(Kurmaskie). This setting was very happy and pleasant just like the narrators mood.	1	1		1																					
1393	3	The wether can change the corse of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold out side then the cyclist will bring beveyer cloths if its. Hoter out side he would most likly bring lighter clothes. If he was riding farther hed bring more supplys like water and food If he was going on a short rid then he wouldn�t bring so much stuff. The way the wether is changes the way a person will prepaire,	1	1		1																					
1400	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert- like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake . blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me� (Kurmaskie, @NUM1).The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death. They remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. Were the snake in the path to poison him he�d not only under the beaty sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber�s fish camp, the hope is restored back to him. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive. In the end, the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him.	3	3		3																					
1401	3	"The feateres of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example ""not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. ""This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modem bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber� This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now hapy to have water and have reached his destination."	2	2		2																					
1402	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he saw �short, rolling hills,� tumbleweeds� and �a ridiculously large shake,� and he thought that he was not getting anywhere.	1	1		1																					
1408	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speeed limit,� the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story it says �The sun was beginning to beat down. �This quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This means that the cyclist is cold not only going to have to deal with the heat, but he is also going to have to side-over hill after hill. Eventhough they @MONTH1 be small, rolling hills, it still takes alot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is �I got down on my hands and knes, walking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out, followed  by brackish water feling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees �this quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water, that he uses his small amount of strength left to try and get some water. When he finally does get some water, it first come out as an ooey substance then the water come out really hot. In conclusion, these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting. 	2	3		3																					
1410	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because there was tough terrain. The heat had affected him greatly as well. He seemed that every where he would go, he couldn�t find anything, no buildings or people until he got that one town. In the story, �Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist qoutes.�At same point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� @CAPS1 your bike on the middle of the desert, not knowing which way to go and only seeing  harsher conditions can only give you no hope .He soon almost ran out of water only made things worst.The sun beating down on him and his mind playing tricks on him also, so with the cyclist , settings had alot to do with his journey.	3	3		3																					
1412	3	The conditions in the California desert were horrible for a cyclist. The temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry. The roads also had a lot of hills and when a cyclist has to use his energy in the heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard. There were also no stops to refill his water a long the way,which is bad because the neat,lack of water,and all of his energy extension leads to major dehydration.The conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous.	2	2		2																					
1413	3	The setting of the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limit� affected the cyclest greatly. He was riding through a desert in June. This meant that the temperature was very high. The narrator even states �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� @CAPS1 feature of the setting that affected him were the hills. He even calls them	1	1		1																					
1417	3	In the towns that the cyclist arrived at were all ghost towns. In the text, the author said, �it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� It affected the cyclist because, with the towns being deserted, the cyclist couldn�t refill hi water.	1	1		1																					
1418	3	The cyclist was motivated to get the job done. When they   said only �    eighteen miles down the road.� He thought it was going to be forever but he made it because he �conserved his water ...� and last kept on going, when the road   turned into a rocky gravel road, he still kept on going, but it was harder on his legs and water supply.	1	1		1																					
1423	3	In the story there were many features of the setting tha affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is.   	2	2		2																					
1426	3	The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. �The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. I�m sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing.� That road was replaced by a host rolling hills. �With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the author�s �Short, rolling hills�, the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain. I�m sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills.    	3	3		3																					
1431	3	The first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there. The next town wasn�t any better because it was @NUM1 miles down the road. The cyclist faced some problems while on the journey. Some of these problems included snakes - The fact that he wos running out of water- the hill-and the condition of the road.	2	2		2																					
1433	3	The   features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot of dry place and has no water. He is pedaling up hills and that makes him even more tired. The dude is probably dehydrated and   his  conditions   are getting worse!	1	1		1																					
1436	3	The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble. Because of the lack of water, not only might be die but he begins to see mirages. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isn�t good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic can�t help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, they�re landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
1438	3	"In the story �Rough Road Ahead� the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At points the setting mode the author feel depressed and sad and at other times, happy and joyful. For example, the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling with nothing in sight. In twenty miles he saw camp ?? a ?? that he was thirsty and had holes. When he pumped the water, no  come out. These part of the setting gave the cyclist a bad affect. The cyclist gave ""teaches life can be so cruel"" He obviously had a bad effect if he thought life was being cruel At some point in the story the setting be a good affect on the reader. He is able to die of thirst when he sees a bait shop. This puts the cyclist in a good mood because he said �my troubles thirst and feels he all behind me� different settings in the story gave the author a different affect. "	2	3		3																					
1442	3	The cyclist listen to the geogers. after a while he starts to get tired. After the seenery desert change he starts to get mad. He criticizes himself for accepting advice from �old-timers who haven�t left the	2	2		2																					
1443	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the �fork of sorts� as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn�t. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third ""obstacle"" he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still with a smile on his face."	3	3		3																					
1448	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is riding his bike along the road and encounters a dilema.�� @CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. Blocked the� pavement in front of me.� He had to stop and into by the snake which showed him down and freaked him out. He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that �really did look like a diamondback.� @CAPS2, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it�s a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles.� I�d read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.� * @CAPS3 he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on. This affected him because he @CAPS3 got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning. The features of 	3	2		3																					
1452	3	"In the story, these are many elements that affected the cyclist in his journey.The first features of the setting that affects him is the old water pump, which did not work, and when it did the water from it lasted horrible. The next obstacles on his journey was rough terrain. ""Flat road  was replaced by short rolling hills,"" was how he described it. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be  abandoned. Eventually he finds a  town and rest after his long journey, and learns his lesson from before not to take advice from people he doesn�t know."	2	2		2																					
1455	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist is traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Another affect said in the story was that the cyclist made it to a town where the water pump was all rusted and with all his strength, he worked the handle and got a tarlike substance followed by brackish water which he couldn�t drink. Also , the cyclist had been hitting his water bottles regularly. Lastly, the old-timers said the towns would be close when really they were far apart.	2	2		2																					
1457	3	Well the setting was the lil boy was on the bike and he meets this old man and the man toke him a short cut. So he took dis road and I guess something went wrong.	1	1		1																					
1458	3	In the �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the main characters, the cyclist. After he first journied from the house where he met the old men, he rode over much flat desert terrain, where the sun beat down and dehydrated him. Soon, though the terrain changed. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion.	2	2		2																					
1461	3	The The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the cyclist @CAPS1 challenging porblem face by the author. Forexample, I nottice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had erected the first few things, a large highway. That�s shows when he arrived, the road does not good and also large highway high of jumped.	1	1		1																					
1466	3	In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink.	2	2		2																					
1475	3	The story that I am doing the most was going to talk about what happen in the story I was not shore but the name of the story sound prety good if I was in the story I not be good becaus the story is really crazy I would be realy good two start and right	0	0		0																					
1478	3	The conditions that the cyclist was in was very horid as he continued on his ride he got hotter and hotter hoping to find water after he finished of his last bit. Taking advices from an old man was and his last decision he made.	1	1		1																					
1487	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated, getting tired, and by getting lost. After the cyclist was on the road for a while he had drank almost all of his water, but he still had a while to go before he got to his destination. He was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around. He also got tired because he was out in the sun, had barley any water, and he didn�t know where he was going. One last example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people. So if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired and getting lost were the features of the setting affect the cyclist had.	2	2		2																					
1489	3	Well if the setting relates to the theme then the story will make sence, like if it�s a sad story and it�s a ugly rainy day then it will match verry nice. That�s how the setting makes it better.	1	1		1																					
1490	3	If it is hot Out you can dehydrate quickley. also, if is ff ong hand hilly you use a lot of energy. It can berough on equipment, body, and mind. Make sure you dress apropreit lyand carry lot so f water. Next, make sure your tiresa inflated and all equip is working properly. then, plan a good route that you can stopat places and catch a breath or some water. also, make sure you eat well, food provides a lot of energy.	2	2		2																					
1491	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	2	3		3																					
1495	3	In the story �Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limits,� The setting is a long road with �no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind he cyclist could be affected by the rough road that he have to ride down.	1	1		1																					
1496	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experience of bike riding in the desert. The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he �enjoyed the serenity of an eary-summer evening�. The word �serenity� gives the affect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the �ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule� in a ghost town that he meets in the desert. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating �Rough Road Ahead�. Kurmaskie�s confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low. Finally, kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a �rather modern bathroom� where he can stop to get a drink. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie�s confidence is followed by determination and then relief.	3	3		3																					
1503	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� For example, he finds a �ramshackle shed� and tries to find water. It affected him, because it says, �I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� The quote meaning that he was determined to find water and perhaps anything.	1	1		1																					
1506	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist when he was thirsty. �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could be seen.� This proves that the rider was thirsty because in the paragraph before this talks about him having a last burst of energy going down a hill. And he was also sweating a lot. And also wiping sweat from his eyes. 	1	1		1																					
1508	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. The setting affected the cyclist performance. For example, the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened for instance, the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of. Again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. For example, the river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water. In conclusion, the setting had a major affect on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1512	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie show that as the day goes on the cyclist becomes tired and wornout from his long ride through rough terrain trying to find his way back home then he saw some buildings down a hill and said �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill� (kurmakie @NUM1). After the rider gets home he says he is going to do it again.	2	2		2																					
1513	3	The main affect is the lack of water. It is in June, while riding his bike in California. Therefore it�s going to be very hot and he�ll need a lot of water t stay hydrated. When he sees that Welch�s Grape Juice factory, it just makes him think of his thirst even more. Also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest. He starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain. This doesn�t help his dehydration. That�s why you should always carry a lot of water with you if you�re riding a bike during the summer	2	2		2																					
1514	3	The affects of the settings was how hot it was and the cyclist road he was on. The rider said it was June in the summer time, very hot. And the roads were not smooth, the were very old and ragady.	1	1		1																					
1517	3	"The setting in the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very hot in dry, very little shade or moisture, at some point maybe even none at all. This whether affected the author because he had no water at all so he was getting more dehydrated the further he went."	1	1		1																					
1523	3	"In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride he talked about the struggles he had to face. when he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He choose to take their advice but later regreted it. when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns. ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""He dose eventually reach a town were he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite, the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was pleged by the sun and lack of watrer. The sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water. when he rached his last few sips he resisted from drinking it and began loosing consciesness. ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."""	3	2		3																					
1527	3	"There were many features of the setting that affeced the cyclist. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 there is a sign that states rough road a head. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM4 it says ""over the long onpiling hill.� He also the tempature as started on page @NUM5 and at the top of page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM7 � l was travling in hing desertd of california in June. These conditions of the setting all effect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
1532	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road Ahead, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affect the cyclist because the determine how easy or hard he ride is for the cyclist. For example. The land being hot, would enable him to die or heat struck without water, the land being dry means he doesn�t have a place to refill his water supply and the land being barren means to the man that if he didn�t be of heat stroke there is a chance he wouldn�t be found and wouldn�t survive. Another example of how the features of the setting offer the cyclist is in the story when the road gets rough and he sees the speed time sign his though are about here he is going a water depleating 12 mph. This shows that he features of the setting, namely the contour of the land and the roughness or he road make the journey a lot harder on the cyclist. The features of a setting could possibley be the biggest arrest on a cyclist, and whether they have a long hard journey in which they have to push themselves to the limit like in this story or a nice lersury ride."	3	2		3																					
1549	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, �I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.�  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him."	1	1		1																					
1550	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist not sticking to his map. Instead of sticking to his map he had asked a couple of old people. The old people that gave the cyclist directions also gave him a short cut to take. That�s where the second effect came in where the cyclist started to use a shortcut instead of the main road. That�s how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.   	1	1		1																					
1556	3	When the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself. He sees everything as the old men told him. As he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty. �There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The man started becoming very unsure. You could tell he says �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get excited.� He was very doubtful he�d get to where he was going. In the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water.  	2	2		2																					
1562	3	The author finds the desolate and harsh settings to be not discouraging, rather they stand out as a cause of amusement and fun, quest-like tests. The author writes that after arriving at his first ghost-town, he chuckles, amused by the funny �old codgers� and their crazy ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isn�t the least bit established anymore, he�s slightly disappointed, but sees it as �a test of [his] inner spirit.� At the third building an abandoned factory he still appreciates the irony of the situation. While biking across the desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and instead uses it as a point of reference to work his progress and as a way to push himself. Though the author is faced with empty disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing 	1	1		1																					
1572	3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says� i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can�t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find �towns� nearby. Once he finds them, they are either �ghost towns� or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way.	3	2		3																					
1576	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier. Finnally there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet.	2	1		2																					
1581	3	"In the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through �The high deserts of California in June.� It was hot, so hot the infact, that the author realized he could �drop from heatstroke� at anytime. This unbearable heat, coupled with the �crippling� hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a stale of severe dehydration. Obviously not exactig a positive effect. The swelting heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the eyeishes diverting water supply. However, �There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind� The cyclist was incomplete isolation for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, the sweating sun heating down upon him as he toiled up steep unyielding hills clearly the setting was affecting the cyclist in horribly negative way."	3	3		3																					
1587	3	"The features of the setting in �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� affected the cyclist. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The flat road that was easy to bike on had changed to many hills that made the cyclist's job alot harder. The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope."	2	2		2																					
1594	3	The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly men�s directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. He�s also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old men�s directions. He�s really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if they�ve lost it. 	2	2		2																					
1596	3	According to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example; the author states �I had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June�. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view�. This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclist�s trip and how it affected her.	3	3		3																					
1614	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. They affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains. Also because he didn�t follow his plan on the map he had no cloe where he was and so I think the anxiety of the whole thing took a toll on his physical well being. It affected him mentally because every town he passed through, or every building he passed was deserted and he had no idea where any people were so that had to stress him out. This mentally messed him and he thought he was going to die, thats not good for anyone. I really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore. Maps don�t go crazy and they don�t really get outdated, and maps don�t lie to you so he obviously learned his lesson.	2	2		2																					
1621	3	The settings effected the cyclist, because where ever he went it seem to never end. Like when he was riding along where the old men told him to go. He went through a ghost town like they said he would go through a town. Then he kept on going but it never end and the summer heat started to get to him. Like when he started to dehidade he this old juice factor and started imagening that he was drinking juice. So he started seeing things.	1	1		1																					
1622	3	As the author cycles through this shortcut, he is in a very dangerous setting. As said in the poem, he is in the high deserts of California in June. A desert makes the heat unberable for the cyclist. Its just sun, sand, and him. Then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about @NUM1 almost maybe even hotter. This could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply. �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� Then there is the distance of his ride. The author is always saying �About @NUM2 miles� or �Twenty miles up the road.� All of this hard work can cause heatstroke & kill him.	2	2		2																					
1626	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization. The narrator said, �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his llife. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesn�t have making him dehydrate faster. The narrator saids, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of made it so much worse that he had no water.	1	1		1																					
1627	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist follows some bad advice, which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water. The setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to be dehydrated, which presents the main conflict of the story. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,� the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out. Another factor the setting presents to the cyclist is the extreme heat of the California desert. This adds to the cyclist thirst and dehydration. The reader can tell it is unpleasantly hot when reading, �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt�, that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June�� The rough roads and challenging terrain also present a challenge to the cyclist that slows his advance to Yosemite.	2	2		2																					
1628	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting. The cyclists has been pedaling his bike in the direction that the old men told him to go to get to Yosemite. Soon he is out of water and very tired and he believes he will die soon. But then he finds a fish camp, goes in the bathroom to revive himself. when he comes out a man is sittiNg on the porch. The author gets directios from him and is happy that he is on the right track again.	1	2		2																					
1631	3	"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says �with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat� when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he �drank deeply from the sink.� The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1636	3	The effect of cyclist is very and treding becose alot of thing can go worrs like you can feel so hot have and water wouldn�t cool down it didn�t matter. But when drop in you mouth had the flavor of battery acid. He or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeus day in June. So hot that you are seeing thing like a town hot pouring a refeshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave.  	1	1		1																					
1653	3	The features for the cyclist in rough road ahead is not the kind l�D  war a be in at forts. I thought it was going to be  a scenery story but it turns out he want that prepared. He took directions from some olden guys who haven�t left their house sense carter was in office. He was a bike peddaling threw the California desert with the things you can carry cause your on a bike. He ran out of water and could of got heatstroke or colapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite. The conditions this biker is in  hormone and I dont think he was prepared. Always stick in your gut.	3	2		3																					
1658	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about. After the ride didn�t turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to �set in�. The aridity of the climate would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with but the scorching sun would make him become dangerously dehydrated.	1	2		2																					
1659	3	The  cyclist  runs  into some pretty tough challenges. The real vies of the setting affected him, because there was so many optical that he had to overcome, for  example, he  got directions  from some old men who move then lively didn�t really know what they were talking about. Then he ran out of water so he had nothing to drink and the road started to get bumpily and he saw snakes. There were no buildings nor cars around so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed. He came  up on an old factory, that was thought to be the Welch�s Grape juice, factory, but was abandoned and looked like it had been for a while, towards the end he found this fish came where he finally got water and was around people. These different optical affected his mood and how determined he was.	3	2		3																					
1667	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie many obstacles are caused from the diffrent settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled � I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. � This caused the loss of determination, which led to him lossing his consciousness. The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually  make him lose consciousness. He said � if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time.�  	2	1		2																					
1668	3	The setting of the story had effected the cycle�s becuse if it was sub earbs he could have stoped any where and got water but the plot was in a middle of a desert and all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water For example, he had to go @NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water and if he was not in the desert with hills he could have made that in no time at all    	1	1		1																					
1670	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is to hot. It is hot enough that his water tasts like battery acid.  Then he has to deal with difficult trails breakway he said �old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� This is sayin that the old-timers gave him old directions. Plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop. Then when he was riding he said �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.� With him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat. This was why the setting was affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1677	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, �These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,� If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I�m glad the cyclist didn`t. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him.	2	2		2																					
1678	3	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, �That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office�. This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who haven�t left their homes in years.	2	2		2																					
1693	3	"The features of the setting exhuberate the cyclist. The June weather added to the water depletion, being the beginning of summer, when the cyclist �arrived at the first �town�"" it was deserted, and the water had disgusting water. The author uses verbal irony when calling it a town �town� having it not really be a town anymore. The large snake presented an air of danger and another abandoned Grape Juice Factory added to the hopeless lost tone. "	2	2		2																					
1704	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed Limit�, the cyclist is trying to get to Yosemite with directions that some codgers, or eccentric old men, gave him. The cyclist, said the old men looked as though they, �haven�t left the confines of their poaches since carter was in office. �  Well, he takes their advice, and he gets lost about @NUM1 along on his journey. While looking forward to the �Cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite�� he was traveling through a barren desert. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� This type of setting could really bring down a cultist�s mood while thinking of Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of ever finding Yosemite at this rate. If you have a nice setting, it makes the trip worthwhile, and your ending point even better.	1	1		1																					
1705	3	The setting effected the performence of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist. The rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them. �over one long, crippiling hill, a building came into view.� The long, big hills that he had to go up and made him more thirsty, but probably more satisfied when it was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. This brought his hopes down. But continued to move on. In my life, I have never had such an experience to where I had to keep pushing and urging myself to my goal, but the closes I got, the more distractions got in the way to and stop me.	2	3		3																					
1711	3	"In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected they cyclists physical abilities. The features affected is abilities, because the climate and dangerous environment was hot and rough to handle. These features were hot and rough 'Since he was in the California deserts in June. The passage that supports this is,�. Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Also, the features of the setting give him determination. They give him determination, because each horizon he sees gives him hope. They give him hope since he knows he is that much @NUM1 to Yosemite National Park. The passage that supports this is when he drops,"".distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that @CAPS1 could move it that far, I�d be fine.� In the story,"" Rough road ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of his settings affect both they cyclists physical and mental abilities"	2	3		3																					
1712	3	"The features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. There was a point in the story where he ran out of water ad he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the rode. He was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road. So he started off and the two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. ""Sometimes life can be so cruel.� @CAPS1 hills took a lot out of him and he was now on a highway. Before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily. �I could make that!� But after the terrain change he looses hope and almost don�t make it. �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough it has a huge negative effect on the cycilists."	3	2		3																					
1715	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. It seems to be the more despirate the situation the more determand her becomes. Pg @NUM1 (I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean). Right after he thinks this he climbed away for the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams. He says pg @NUM1 come troubles, thirst and tean where all behind me, this shows that after a situation the bilaver tells realeoved of all earthley obligations. Not only does the settings affect the cyclist but the entire story around him.	2	2		2																					
1718	3	The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First comes the windy roads. As he goes along his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. �Not the miley into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. �This shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is over whollmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before hagon up, he found a place to get water and to relax. �Then, as easily as running about, my troubles thirst, and nor were all behind me� This shows that he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and it made happy and have a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined.	3	3		3																					
1719	3	It give him a hard time so he learn a lot of thing from that he know that it not always easy. It not abig problem but sometime some small problem become bigger life is like riding bike you have any down some time have problem sometimes lost but that is life.	0	0		0																					
1721	3	The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the �� high   deserts of California� �   (kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills �   (Kurmaskie @NUM1   ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one   of them as a   �� long, crippling hill� � (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). Clearly, the terrain, which got   increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1726	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affect the cyclist. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to,his determination increases and decreases. For example, when he saw a building come into view ahead of him, he got excited and used all his energy to get down the hill to the building. Also, when he came to the next building and found a working bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting. 	2	3		3																					
1728	4	The narrater has that in with Paragraph becuse it all makes sence and it go'ss along together. The narrater says that when the guiss come out and the hibicus is budding is becuse it is ones more agian spring   	0	0		0																					
1729	4	The author concludes the story with that passage to show the importance of the inspiration Saeng gets from the hibiscus plant. Saeng, throughout the story was comforted by the hibiscus plant because it reminded her of home. The plant during the winter metaphorically explains: @CAPS1 attitude towards her new country and her driving test; the hibiscus plant in the winter is not as beautiful in the bitter cold, but it adapts and survives, and returns to its beautiful state in the spring. Saeng is bitter about her new country and driving test, but is adapting, and will be inspired by the beautiful state of the hibiscus in the spring to try her test again. In conclusion, the author ended the story in that way to stress importance in the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus plant.	3	2		3																					
1730	4	The author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change. The snow is melting represents change from cold to warm. The geese returning represents a new life as in coming back to something semi�new. Just like the author is going back to drivers ed. The hibiscus is budding represents growth. The author will be older and more knolageble and more skilled than before.	1	2		2																					
1732	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author wanted to tell about about when saeng will take the test again. The author told the time with the season of the spring. In spring all the snows were melted and the geese and hibiscus has budding. And this paragraped make the reader to understand easyer. This is why the author include this paragraph in the story. 	1	1		1																					
1734	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing. In the paragraph she is basically saying when the geese return and my flower is budding I'll be prepared enough to take the test. She'll be prepared because she'll be adapted enough and she'll have experienced enough just like the plant and the geese. She Is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower.	2	1		2																					
1735	4	The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before and she wants to pass it. It makes you wonder if she will pass it or not.	1	1		1																					
1749	4	 In� Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the main character, saeng , undergos many obstacles as she tries to adapt to her new country , which is very different from her home. The author chooses to end the story, as,� When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 the author meant to end the story in this fashion to ensure the reader that saeng has found new hope , which symbolized by the hibiscus flower.Now along with  budding  new hope, the flower also carries a sentimental value ,about her home .Sometimes ,the best way to overcome your obstacles is to embrace them, as she did in the greenhouse ,then   that leaves room to start anew.	2	3		3																					
1753	4	I think that she ended the story like that because it means that she is getting used to all the seasons. �In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hisbiiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� She will and take the test once its not cold anymore so she will wait until the geese come again which will be spring by then. I think that she is also trying to say that when the snow melts and the geese are there again she will have taken the test and pass it. This is I think she ended it like this because how they mean something to her.	1	1		1																					
1755	4	By ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and perservering . for example , when the author says� when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding ,�she show the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring by returning to their home and the hibiscus is starting fresh by  budding again. This is why spring is when saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test. The paragraph also shows that saeng, like the hibiscus, is perservering. The hibiscus is perservering by making it through the winter and blooming again while saeng   is perservering by retaking the test. The author ends with this paragraph to show that saeng is not going to give up. 	3	3		3																					
1757	4	The concluding paragraph explains her next goal. She had to take a test but failed it. Paid over nineteen dollars for the plant. It reminded her of her old home. She will have confident in the spring because the plant grew to its new home so she will grow to her new home also.	2	2		2																					
1758	4	The author concludes the story with his par paragraph because. She will take the test in the spring and she will do her best. She said �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. By failing a test. doesn�t mean. that its not end of everthing. She will have more confidence next time she take the test.	1	1		1																					
1759	4	The author concludes the story, �winter hibiscus,� with this paragraph of the story, for several relevant reasons. By concluding the story, in this way it shows Saeng�s growth, and more willingness to strive, and do her best. When she says she will take the test again, it shows her gain of confidence, and her beginning to gain comfort in the place that is not her home country. She is now striving and working toward doing her best to become successful. And she is making the very best of the given situation. The author is trying to give more depth and meaning to the study in this way. Saeng went from being nervous and worried when saying, �I-I failed the test,� to now setting a goal for herself to take it again, the time the bud blooms next year. Basically, the author did a full circle, by ending the story in this way. From speaking of the test, to sharing the flower experience with her mother, to state that she will re-take the test, next year. 	3	2		3																					
1760	4	The auther concludes with that paragraph because. it shows that despite her sorrow and discomfort, Saeng is able to remain hopeful. In the story, Saeng sees a hibiscus which makes her very homesick for her native country of Vietnam. The reader also leans that she failed a test and feels at of place. However, the hibiscus symbolizes hope and comfort. The auther chooses to conclude with that paragraph because despite Saeng�s hardships, the hibiscus helps her realize that she can overcome he obstacles and be hopeful of the future.	2	2		2																					
1761	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when saeng and her mother go back to there home where the flowers were more beautiful than the flowers where there living now. She wants to plant flowers that�s going to remind her of her home. In the story saeng mother said that it�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here this winter hibiscus her mother wanted her to know that the only thing that maths is that the plant can last threw winter.	1	1		1																					
1779	4	I think that the included that because she is compareing her slef as a flower. When she grows again like a flower she will go prove to past that test. She�s saying there always a second chance. She want to tell everyone that it�s to miss or a misake. For an example �they said there were many of things that she had thought of strangely, season up seson.	2	1		2																					
1783	4	Change and disappointment are enough to over-come. Some people have an arid fear of change. For Saeng the main character from �winter Hibiscus,� change comes in the form of a move to @LOCATION1. Everything around her is different and new. Coupled with disappointment of failing her driver's exam, the feeling of living helpless overwhelms her. After buying a winter hibiscus plant, she vows to take the test again when it blooms in the spring. The resiliance of the winter flower and the memories it represents inspire seng to try again.	2	3		3																					
1786	4	I believe that the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuation in life. In the story Saeng takes a �test� and fails. She goes out and buys a hibiscus plant for well over what she what she should have paid for it. Her test is to try to get over the memories of her real �home� that Saeng is now only cries about when she thinks of it. To Saeng the plant represents memories and a life that she once had, but no longer does, however does want it back. Her vowe to herself is that when the geese come flying back over her that she will go back to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home and try once again to say �home� without breaking down, and without having something extremely expensive.	2	2		2																					
1791	4	I think that the author concluded the story like that because of who throw out the whole Story the plot was in the winter. She might wanted to try it in a different season to see if she might to better with the whot setvation. That is why I think the author concluded the story like that.  	0	0		0																					
1795	4	The authors concludes that in the paragraph. I think he concluded that in these because it shows alot of confidence about her. For example when she said, �then I will take that test again�. It sounded very confident and made it where she can want to try if she or he fails the first time.	2	3		3																					
1796	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she has not given up on her dreams.	1	1		1																					
1799	4	The author ends the story with this conclusion to show that @PERSON1 is very passionate about connecting her life in the United States, to how life was in Vietnam and bringing them together somehow. In the story, @PERSON1 talks about how she misses home and how she is still trying to adapt to her new life away from the home she knew, when saeng says that she has failed the test and wants to take it again, she means that she wants to show that she can survive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When saeng spent @MONEY1 on a plant, her mom was in disbelief because Saeng knows how hard it is to survive. When the conclusion says,�I will take the test again,� it shows that Saeng is willing try to make it in the United States from Vietnam, proving that she can make a better life for herself and her family by working hard. While still keeping trditions in Vietnam alive. Saeng simply wanted to make her new home feel like Vietnam by buying a plant she knew her mother would like.	2	2		2																					
1803	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng has found from hibiscus plant. Like the  plant Saeng is going to overcome an obstacle. She will try the driving test again and the plant will overcome. The harsh   ,blutal winter months. The plant will bloom in the spring and show its restrency during adversity. Saeng   will also overcome the  adversity  she faced when failed her driving test and realizing how much she missed her homeland. Saeng too, in a sense will bloom in the spring. The winter, representing her despise  and homesickness, will not present her from living happly and taking the test over.The hibiscus reminds her of the. The story ends with the paragraph to show how the � Winter Hibiscus� has taught her something about overcoming obstacles.	3	2		3																					
1807	4	The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test.	1	1		1																					
1812	4	"The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is a about a girl who moved with her mother to @LOCATION1. The story tells about the girls transition into the different culture. During the story, the author makes references to the daughter having to pass a test. At the end of the story the author wrote �In the spring�then I will take that test again.� In the text, the girl says �it�s-it�s not a real one,� when referring to the winter hibiscus plant she bought. The reader could infer that this quote means that the girl has memories of home, but they are not the real thing. Also the author wrote �� much preferred it to the Big Mac"". This quote shows that she misses her own culture & cannot adapt to the @CAPS1 one that she lives in now. In conclusion, the girls test @MONTH1 be that she needs to be able to handle change & also be able to recall memories of her homeland with happiness instead of sadness."	2	3		3																					
1814	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has everything together. One way it ties everything together is by taking what had happen in the beginning and tieing it in with why she had bought the flower in the first place. Also it ties Saeng's old memories from Vietnam to her new way of life in the United States. The story states ""carefully Saeng dicked it up and smilled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. the familiar programe filled her lungs."" this is now the flower she found in the flower shop gave her memories from Vietnam. this is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1818	4	"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says �when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story �Winter Hibiscus� used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."	3	2		3																					
1825	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost farmllular to her now� & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas.	1	1		1																					
1829	4	 The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story  ��Winter Hibiscus�� with that paragraph to show Saeng  starting over��� In the spring , When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding� connects to her  life, is that she is starting fresh in away. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, she is making on effort, and ��take that test again��� By retailing the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to ��@CAPS1 of loss.�� and to her grief.      	2	2		2																					
1834	4	To her the hibiscus was a test. Saeng felt she failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing �now.� The hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent over @MONEY1 on it, knowing she and her mother needed the money. Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test.	1	1		1																					
1838	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong ho, the ending includes the hibiscus budding and retaking the test to make a connection between the two. The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go. The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her �budding� will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle.	3	2		3																					
1855	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending but I have no idea on what that means so the author should explain what it means not me.	0	0		0																					
1857	4	The author concludes this paragraph because Saeng is going to wait untill winter is over so she can have a fresh beginning. She wants to try again because the last time she messed up and tilled the plants. Saeng wants to become a gardener like her mother.	0	0		0																					
1862	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he�s trying to prove his point. I think that Saeng was comparing herself to the flower. For example the flower was originally a wild flower and then and then it was planted in a pot. Saeng was free happy girl but then she had to move to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng feel like they are out of place. Since in the story Saeng is similar to the flower then at the end then at the end of the story I think that Saeng thinks that if the flower can survive the winter then she can survive @LOCATION1 and she can pass the test. This is why I think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across.	3	2		3																					
1866	4	The author include s the last paragraph to show that she still has hope. it is the last sentence because @CAPS1  fong Ho wants to show that when all seems lost and your at the end of the line you can always hope for the better when spring comes so will a new beginning not only saeng�s plant but also for her life in a different country.	1	2		2																					
1871	4	The author concludes the story the way that she does because it shows Saeng�s willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming winter. Saeng vows to herself, �When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�� @CAPS1 from this, you can tell that Saeng has hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her home. She says of the hibiscus, �it�s not like the kind we had before.� But she realized that the hibiscus could be a reminder of home as well as reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive living somewhere new.  	2	2		2																					
1874	4	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant represent to being determined to survive. In other words, the hibiscus brings Saeng a good luck for her next driving test after winter season uhen the hibiscus is budding. Also, the reason why the author concluded the sentence to show what her plan for the future	1	1		1																					
1877	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. In this story it about a @PERSON1, a girl and her mother. The girl is given money to buy a plant seeds. She spend @MONEY1 on this plant. Her mother get upset, but every thing turn on it, lk they had egg omlets with bits of melon.	1	1		1																					
1878	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she wants to show that after everything that happened, saeng will move on and try hard. For example, when she said, �When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� By ending the story like this, it leaves the reader in suspense because they do not know if the geese will return. The author seems to be showing the reader that Saeng is starting to adapt to her new country and make it like her old one. For example, when the mother said, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.� This shows that they want their new country to be more like their old one and when it is, she will be happy. Therefore, the author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how she will adapt to the change in her environment.   	2	2		2																					
1882	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph he/she wanted to compare Saeng life with the plant. For example, in the story Saeng had just failed her driving test and then she saw a plant the reminded her of homeland. From the flower shop to the house, she is comparing her home land to the flower which shows how she relates to it. So the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase she will too and go for her drivers license.	2	1		2																					
1885	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the importance of new beginnings and to accentuate the theme in the story. The theme is that one must overcome hardships and seek new beginnings. The springtime is a representation of a new beginning. So, the new beginning of spring will allow her to start all over again on the drivers� test. Also, the author uses the paragraph to show the symbolic qualities of everyday things. Just how the hibiscus reminded her of home life, the geese will remind her of springtime.	2	2		2																					
1897	4	"In this story theauther deicides to end the story with this paragraphe, ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buding, then I willtake that test agien."" because she wants to take the test when every thing is isanters, de forexample she wants everything she likes in her nuforment such as the flowers, the geese and the whether. Another reason why I say the author ends the story with that paragragh because she wants to be, ua eviorment like the one that she was in her home country forexemple there was no snow it was like sping time all ver around. This is why I say that the auther ended the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1898	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, that cannot pass the test until it is. �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of before had become through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. �This shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants because she is thinking back to other times where things have been strange during the winter and better in the spring and @DATE2 seasons when the plants are budding, so she believes that she will actually pass the drivers test when she feel comfortable, when the plants have budded.	2	2		2																					
1904	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� made a good choice to conclude the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.� This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become �almost familiar to her now� The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng�s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her �obstacle,� and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng�s life will have come full circle.	3	3		3																					
1910	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think he�s trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season  that was almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again	1	1		1																					
1912	4	The author ends the story this way to show that there can always be a happy ending. The geese came back  and the girl was happ because of  it.	0	0		0																					
1913	4	The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on.She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it�s strong enough to live through the winter.The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes.	1	2		2																					
1916	4	I believe the author of �winter Hibiscus� used this for the last paragraph because it is saying when she sees that hibiscus it will give her memories of home again which will bring encouragement for the test. �The geese symbolize Saeng's determination to pass the test and try like the new country. Saeng explains, �she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the @NUM1) this quote creates a vivid image in my mind that lets me know Saeng will really go and take that test when she has encouragement from not only the geese but the hibiscus also.	3	3		3																					
1918	4	The Author uses this paragraph to @CAPS1 the Story because it shows how Saeng wants to adapt to this country and she is allready beging to understand it and like it. When it @CAPS2 �and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� It is a metaphor about herself when the @CAPS3 begins to bloom and @CAPS4 Just as she is starting to bloom and @CAPS4. This is why the Author endeded with this passage.	1	1		1																					
1925	4	The author choose this end to show that saeng hasn't given up on how she is living yet. It shows that even though she really loved her hometown, and feels and remembers a lot back then. She had taken the test and failed, living where she was living then just seemed too much pressure on her. Although she hasn't quite adapted throughly she will try her best to surcome situations that are brought upon her. It gives the reader hope by ending the story like this, instead of just leaving the reader at she bought a flower after failing a test and moves on with her life. For example when she failed the test she seemed distressed and very angry. I,�I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. For a long moment mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shedding it to bits.�it anger Saeng how she had to leave her happy past life for one that is different and challenging. When faced with a challenge extreme emotiona situations occur. Saeng just needed hope and the author choose this to betray to then reader there is a chance of hope!	3	3		3																					
1930	4	She vowed this because just as the geese would return she shall. also as the test themselves to learn and grow she would. Furthermore she @CAPS1 the the test of love, survial and family tridition she would know that comeing. back was destiny. In example they come to raise their young for the journey that they shall face and Help them to  realise that they always will come back because their lives started there and to always exacpe cold and man kind that wants to harm their lives. The winter months are very harsh there so They know that they have to leave just to @CAPS2. She learns the lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival.	1	1		1																					
1931	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he made a comittment to himself of taking the test all over again. He probably said that because there�s always a next time for everything. mostly the reason he said it was to remind himself that theres always another try of everything. Finally that most people such know that everyone get a second chance.	1	1		1																					
1934	4	To set a tone and to talk about how they look. Also that little paragraph can also start another book or to get you into studing things. It could also compare Your life with the geeses life. Like explaning what hardships you went through.	1	1		1																					
1936	4	The author concluded like that because he was the one to score the lines below what you write. Score of to level and key better. To all the thing he was surprised to kindly be seprated by for there by up so blese geve one a high sew o of will sweit all at you up to the end of the authrs concludes 	0	0		0																					
1943	4	Saeng wants to take the test again when it is beautiful out and the hibiscus is buddy. The plant shows the beautiful achievement of passing the test. The plant will help her past the test by being strong, tough, and nicely finished. These characteristics reprecent the girl and the flower. The day was a good day and wants to take the test on the same day. The plant was strong and tought. This represents the girl in that time she didn�t pass. She told her mother and was very understandig about it. The plant represents beautiful things and the geese represent beautiful things. The girl wants to do that on that time of day and thinks she will get it next time. When she completes and past her test she wants to come home to the beautiful surroundings to remember that day. The author concluded with that statement to represent the importance of the plant and the surroundings of when she wants to past the test.	1	2		2																					
1951	4	Saeng did not give up on herself. She said she would take it over again then she might pass it. You will not always pass on your first try it takes a while sometime. Saeng encourage you to never to give up just cause you did not get it on your first time. She also builds confidence in herself. That�s why the author concluded the story that way.	1	1		1																					
1956	4	What l think the author was talking abount snow and it was add outside for the bays matter and snow started to melted.	0	0		0																					
1957	4	He concluded the story with that sentence because it told that she learned a lesson in life. all the way back home where she originally came from she missed her friends ibet and seeing her mother work out in the garden durring this time of year when its cold. I guess there poor in one way. In conclusion the choose this sentence because it sounds like she learned a lesson in life and even starting all over again but with a better understanding in her learning.	1	1		1																					
1958	4	Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her so she is going to take the test again after winter.	1	1		1																					
1961	4	The reason that the author chose to end this story with this paragraph is to tell the reader that things get better as time goes on. Saeng failed the driver�s test because she wasnt ready. The flower bloomed before it was ready. The author is saying you need to be patient and good things will come your way	1	1		1																					
1966	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its showing she still has hope. The hibiscus gives her hope and strength. In the spring she will take her test again and will hope to pass it. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
1969	4	Why I think she added this is because she needs time to grow like the plant before she takes the test again. Sometimes you need more time to pass your test. going through school teaches more than stuff we need to know it helps us grow up, and how to understand life. I know myself as a tenth grader that I understand life more than I did in first. She still has a lot of growing mentaly about her past and preasnt.	1	1		1																					
1974	4	"From the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the author concludes this story with the paragraph of what Saeng vowed silently because it is to show Saeng�s determination. The hibiscus was the plant she found, that was closly resembled the one at �home,� to symbolize her conformt. The hibiscus symbolized her determination in life. �through the quiet repetiton of season upon season, almost familiar to her now� from this, you can conclude that Saeng is thinking of how she reconignzed the geese. It gives her greater confidence within herself. From this, �like the Geese she lifited her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched,"" and this explains that there is still hope inside of her. This paragraph conclusion the author had concluded ties together what Saeng is now hoping and believing in."	2	2		2																					
1990	4	In the short story ��Winter Hibiscus,�� by Minfong Ho, a teenage girl fails a driving test but vows to take it again in the spring. The story was ended like this to show that the girl will have a new beginning. For example, ��When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again��(HO). The hibiscus is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland. So if the hibiscus is budding it is starting a new beginning she feels that she will be able to do the same. This is why the story ends like that.        	2	2		2																					
1991	4	"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."	1	1		1																					
1993	4	The author includes that seterel paragraph because they wanted you to be able to visualize it in yor head rather than not seeing the picture. If you see a mental picture then it�s good at visualizeing.	0	0		0																					
1998	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new begining is starting  For example the fact that they moved to a different country. Thats what the author means when the spring comes. Spring represents a new life which is what Saeng & her mother are doing. Also the snow represents a blanked of the past / hard times. Last but not least when the hibiscus starts to bud that also means a new beganing. So if you put it all together you get the hard times going away when the snow melts & then a new beginning when spring starts & the flower buds  That is why the author put this paragraph in the story because they needed a fresh start.	2	2		2																					
2000	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it is the end of  winter.	0	0		0																					
2002	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1.	1	1		1																					
2007	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has vowed to retake the test in the spring and will have more confidence when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding. �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eye now swept over her. � Saeng feels lonely because she is from a different country and misses everything she knew and loved. Now she has the hibiscus to remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
2008	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing."" You can tell at first the mother is disappointed & then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood. ""How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon? "" ""I�d love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."	1	2		2																					
2014	4	Why did the author conclude the story with this paragraph? I believe that the author concluded that paragraph because it tells what she is going to do in the future. For example in the story she told her mom �I failed�� When she was putting the flower in the hole by the garden a flock of geese were flying, heading south.	1	1		1																					
2016	4	"I think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it shows determination to pass the test. The test was to be able to make the garden graw. You know this because it says �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This shows that the test she look had to do with spring and the budding of flowers and that she is trying to grow something. In this story, they mention her helping her mother in the garden. So I think when the plants didn�t grow, she wanted to try again. That�s why I think they chose to end with the statement saying about taking the test again in the spring."	1	2		2																					
2023	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He was talking for bout ho beautiful was nutura. He also thought sense Saeng loved nutura a lot she was going to go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the grarden taking care of the plant. That why I think the author dicide to finish with that paragraph it would probaly discribe how much he like nature. 	0	0		0																					
2027	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by @PERSON1, a teenage girl; Saeng, and her family, have moved to united states from Vietnam. Saeng is walking home after failing her driver's test, and she passes a familiar plant. She then goes into a florist shop to purchase the plant. She arrives home and tells her mother she failed the test of course her mother is upset, but she makes dinner and the plant the �winter hibiscus� at the end of the story Saeng thinks to herself, �when they come back, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� I think Saeng says she will retake the test in spring because she feels confident and happy now that she is comfortable with the plant she has, and her mother isn't too mad at her. She feels that everything is going to be ok and she can retake the test in spring, when life is blooming.	3	2		3																					
2033	4	The whole story about Saeng buying the hibiscus is in response to her failing the driving test. This crushed her. She wants to be reminded of her old homeland where she did not read to past the driving lessons. So she goes to a green house to find plants that are similar to the ones she used to have in her homeland. She does this to try to make herself feel better but still �in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� Saeng feels she failed and the hibiscus gives her hope and memories of her old country. Her mom clearly sees and understands this when she doesn�t yell at Saeng for spending @NUM1$ on the plant. �I�m glad you got it,� Saeng�s mom says because she knows it comforts her daughter. Together the plant the hibiscus. By doing this they are planting Saeng�s hope to grow, not only to pass the driving test but to make it in the new country. *The story ends with those lines because Saeng decides if the hibiscus will grow then so will she. She will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she adapted. *The hibiscus, although it is not the one she had in the old country, she knows they can adapt to their surroundings and so the plant has in the new country. The plant will grow if it can adapt. Saeng can grow if she adapts to this new country.	3	3		3																					
2037	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the auther felt like she would be ready for the new test. In the text it states that after walking home after failing liner driver test, she sees a familiar plant. later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased That she will take the test again because she feel as thought she is confident to past it the next time around.	1	1		1

The Author include that paragraph because he or she was showing how Saeng is so in love with plants. She couldn�t wait a new winter break was over.	0	0		0																					
2047	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus makes her comfort, she says �when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. Since the author failed the test as it is told in the story, she will feel comfort taking the test again when the hibiscus come again after the snow season.   	1	1		1																					
2049	4	She thinks she is gonna pass the test because on spring becaus everything gets back on live againg flowers start growing again trees start to get green every thing starts to get Green the Geese are returning animals are starting to come out people go to the beach to distract their selve and that might be what she wan�t�s to do.	1	1		1																					
2056	4	She ends with that paragraph because it starts over. When the geese came back and the hibiscus is budding its like restart and she can try again, dealing with her memories of home and her adaption to the new country. I think she will be able deal with it better and take it again, it shows that she wont give up.	1	2		2																					
2057	4	She says that because she had failed to keep the tropical plant a live.She was disappointed in herself and so  that  why  she  said. In  the  spring, when  the  snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this hibiscus is budding, then  I  will take  that  tes t again. When  she  failed  and her mother said it will be okay you can always try again.	1	1		1																					
2060	4	The author might of concluded the story with that sentence to show that she still cares about the test and not mostly about a meisly plant thats gonna die anyways. Also because she needs to pass the test and the author is putting in a getall that in the end the girl is gonna pass and not have to re-take that test all over again. but also he/she tells that because he/she wants us to know that it aint all about other things that are expensive in life but that school is really more important than anything basically.	1	1		1																					
2066	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is saying when everything comes beet to the way they were she will do everything agein so thins aren�t the same as they used to be and she wants them to.	0	0		0																					
2067	4	The girl, Saeng , seems to be attached to nature and enjoy it when the spring comes like she said, a new natural intenill start and she will be motivated to take the test that she failed again. The author most likely finished with this paragraph to show that there will be hope for Saeng and she will do what she has to do to have comfortably in her new home country. The whole story talks about how she is still unsatisfied with her new home but it would be cut to and the stay with new chances and a new life, which they did using springtime to show this.	2	1		2																					
2070	4	The author in @LOCATION1 this because it is shows what is is going to do to he her gain failed and this story a what she must do get just from the geese	0	0		0																					
2072	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� The Author concludes with this paragraph to show that she�s not going to give up and to show her mom that too.	1	1		1																					
2073	4	I belive the author was saying a new start. I say this because of everything coming back. I also say it because Saeng knows whats important now and will take it seriously. That is what I think the author was saying at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2080	4	The author of the story �winter Hibiscus�, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author wrote, �When they come back�in the spring� then I will take that test again�.(No). Saeng thought to herself and meant that she would move on in the spring. It also shows that Saeng could overcome failing the test. The narrative also states,��in the spring�when�this hibiscus is budding��(No). The season of spring means to symbolically start new and fresh. When the flower is budding, it is beginning a new life. Saeng is also starting fresh when she decides that she will take the test in the spring. Finally, this shows that Saeng could adopt to her new life by purchasing a familiar plant. The hibiscus helped her get through disappointing times. The geese also were a reminder that some things back home were the same. Minfong Ho concluded the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's adaptations. 	2	3		3																					
2083	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again�. The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adjust to change while not forgetting where she came from. This is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together. The geese represent the new home and sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places. By @CAPS1 that she�ll take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents how she feels abut @LOCATION1 and by passing the test she allows herself to pass with @LOCATION1 and adjust to the change in her life.	3	3		3																					
2084	4	They used this sentence because she wants to see the flower bud and feels like she is at home again. Then she will take the test. She also will feel lucky and have a memory of home so saeng vowed silently to herself.	1	1		1																					
2088	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again she will do the same. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2089	4	I think the athor includes that becaus. she mite have faeled and need more time to study to get thing @NUM1 so other than that damn new	0	0		0																					
2092	4	In the story �winter hibiscus� by Minfong Ho I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough strength to come back and flourish than she has enough strength to come back and take the test again. For example, in the story it says �but its strong enough to make it through the cold months.� This quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong. And Saeng sees that as if the plant is strong enough to return after a cold winter than she can return to the test after failing. Overall, I think that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants are very strong.	2	2		2																					
2093	4	In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her �test�. But I know this because its says �Then I will take that test again� her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant. So in conclusion she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes just like the hibiscus. 	2	2		2																					
2096	4	He want to learn hibiscus spirits. Don't be afraid of fare. You just keep ahead, continuly to learn what you want, then you will success. like hibiscus has strong alive: fight with evironment. So, the author use this paragraph to conclude, the purpose is the Saeng will take this test again, like hibiscus will budding when spring's come	1	1		1																					
2097	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, the hibiscus is budding. she will take the test. I think that the author conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to test them again.	0	0		0																					
2098	4	The author ended that story like that because that�s  how she started the story.The little girl was looking at the flowers and plants in the the beginning ,so the author thought that it would be a good thing to end the story like it was started.Also because the friendship that Saeng has with the plants and flowers will come back again in the spring when everything is blooming and looking very beautiful.It shows that the plants give a sense of comfort when she is going through hard times.That is why the author concludes with Saeng and the plants.	1	1		1																					
2100	4	Saeng vowed to herself that when the hibiscus begins to bud again she will take the test again. The hibiscus symbolizes hope to saeng that things can work out a second try. She concludes the story with the vow because, it expresses her last bit of hope. For example, the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country, with new surroundings but it also explains how she feels. She vows to show she won't give up despite of falling the first time. For example, �Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense , it was almost visceral �(Ho). This quote explains what the plant meant to her. This is why she concluded the story with a vow.  	2	2		2																					
2102	4	The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows the girl the is willing to overcome obstacles and although she @MONTH1 have failed once she will keep trying, It also shows a connection between the geese and the hibiscus and the girl wanting to overcome her obstacles. Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time.	2	1		2																					
2103	4	In the last paragraph when she siad she was going to have the test again, but in the spring when all the snow melts and the hibiscus budd's. She says that because, that is her favorit time of the year. So she will feel more confident that time. For example when she talks about the manigascar hibiscus that grows through bricks she loves hibiscuses. So she wants to take the test when she feels the best. 	1	1		1																					
2112	4	The author added the last paragraph because Saeng�s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better.	2	2		2																					
2113	4	The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl saeng wanted to take the test again, but also wanted her habiscus to stay strong and to keep growing. So she said I will take the test again when my habiscus starts to bloom again.	1	1		1																					
2116	4	The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says �Saeng vowed silently to herself �which means she wants what is best for herself.	1	1		1																					
2120	4	Determination, help, strength � all are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with the paragraph. First, determination is a @CAPS1 why Saeng will go back and take the test again. Saeng failed her drivers test the frst time and she wants to wait and do it again. Shes determinated to take different steps in order to pass the test. Secondly, I beleieve that help is a @CAPS1 why the author concluded with that paragraph. Saeng will need help in order to pass the test and she beleives that the hibiscus plant will help her pass and help her to do other things. The author is proving that she�ll go back and she�ll be ready. Finally, strength is the last @CAPS1 why the author chose the paragraph to end the story. Saeng beleieves that the hibiscus plant will give her the strength to pass the test. The author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and she�ll be stranger than she was before. These are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	3	2		3																					
2122	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng changed. Saeng didn�t want to take the test and she had no confidence. In the story saengs mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for @MONEY1 because it reminded her of home. Now that Saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again. therefore Saeng has changed.	2	2		2																					
2125	4	The author probally ended with this to show the feeling that Saeng will return and help out again. So Saeng must like to plant. She probaly might hep his mom with alot more things now that she can see what helping might lead too.   	0	0		0																					
2127	4	In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver�s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. �And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. �Saeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph.	2	3		3																					
2133	4	She concludes the story with this paragraph because she want to let the readers of the story that she is not willing to give up and and that she is willing to take the test again and pass it.	1	1		1																					
2140	4	If you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you how comforting something can be that�s from your old country and in your knew one. The fact that Saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. Throughout the story it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house Many times in the story you could always �hear� that sense of love when she would call plant by its native languages name. Throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had. The author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her. Therefore that�s why he concluded the story as such. 	2	2		2																					
2143	4	There could be many reasons the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It could be because Saeng wants to pass the test now to make her mother happy. It could also be because she will need to be able to drive in the next year for some reason. Maybe it�s because it cost her money to keep taking it. She really likes her hibiscus though.	1	1		1																					
2148	4	The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved	2	2		2																					
2154	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring time everything is reborn and in the spring time Saeng will be used to her surroundings. One example of this is when the author states ""she relazed that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befor had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost fimilar to her now. This means that with every season she get more used to her new home and if became more like her and with every season. Another is when the author say�s she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading to the distance.� This reminds her of her old home watching the geese."	2	2		2																					
2157	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it helps to explain the significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus are very important to her and her culture. When there hibiscus around, Saeng feels that she can do anything. That is why she failed the test in the first place. So she is saying that the next time she takes the test, she will have the strength from the hibiscus to help her pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2159	4	The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she�ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant.	1	1		1																					
2163	4	The author ended this story with this paragraph because thats now Saeng felt. She felt connteced  to the geese  and the hibiscus ,� She had lifted her head and watched as their distinctive was etched ,�  � almost familiar to her now ,� She will retake the test in the spring . The hibiscus and the flower will make he feel better in the spring . she should pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2165	4	�When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself .in the spring ,when the snow melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again �.So which mean when they come back she has to make a test up ,so they don�t have to worry about it later.But  on there trip they seen a lot of different thing ,the soil was cold and hard they couldn�t much with it.She though it was walking into another world ,hot, moist world exploding with with greenery @CAPS1  frends and ones of shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion .And beside it was yet another old  friend a small shrub with waxy leaves and the dainty flower with the purplish petals and white centers .It was already dusk when Saeng reach home ,the wind was blowing hard tearing off last remants of green in the chicory weeds that grew thre the crack of the sidwak .So @CAPS2 to they saw a lot of thing on their trip.So saw thing  they never  seen before like the wed growin therw the sidewalk.	1	0		1																					
2170	4	"�then I will take that test again� [@NUM1] Saeng�s whole intention in the story was to take the test and pass it. Houever, ""I-@CAPS1] failed the test, [Ho, @NUM2] which brought the whole story together. She yearned for comfort as she seeked the �@CAPS2 Malik� [Ho, @NUM3] for comfort. Seeing this brought back all the memories of her life �back home� [@NUM1] that kept her going. As a result, bonding with her mother erupted, and it brought another day of hope for her future in her new home. Enough hope for her to say, �when they come back in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�"	1	2		2																					
2171	4	The author ended this story with this sentence because it�s a good conclution. It�s a good conclution because it closes by telling what she will do. This is good  because it shows that Saeng had finally realized that she needs to take that test even though she likes nature so much.	0	0		0																					
2172	4	"The autor of ""winter Hibiscus"" conclded the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeg is going to give the test another try. The author wanted to slow that saeg was not going to giving up in that when the thing that was most important to her was complete that she would then take the test again. In the sory it says that ""saeg did not dare look at her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus is what was important t"	2	2		2																					
2179	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� To show that the character has become a part of her new environment. Just like the environment, she is constantly going through changes, and in the spring when all things that couldn�t be their best during winter begun to thrive, she will too. And when she begins thriving and feels like herself again, then she�ll be ready to take the driving test, and pass. She�ll have returned to her old self like the geese return home when she's done crying like the snow� s done melting, and when she�s done crying like the snow�s done melting, and when she�s ready to open up, just like the hibiscus begin budding, she�ll be ready to take the test.	3	2		3																					
2180	4	All throughout the story �Winter Hibiscus�, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country. But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng�s future and growing confidence.	2	2		2																					
2182	4	Minfong Ho concluded �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph to show hope and renewal for the character Saeng. Spring represents birth and renewal, a second chance for Saeng. She had previously failed what seems to be an important test (perhaps her citizenship test), and motivated her to try and remember her past, which she sorely misses. The winter hibiscus seems to represent herself, and this illustrates it: �it�s-it�s not a real one,� Saeng mumbled she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. �Not like the kind we had before� I know her mother said quietly' 'its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That is what matters. This describes Saeng�s position perfectly � she is not the same, as happy as she once was, but she can make it through the hard times, and can bloom in the spring to take the test again. This shows the purpose of the last paragraph in �winter hibiscus� to show the renewal and hope that Saeng will experience.	3	2		3																					
2183	4	I think that this sentence was choosen to be the last sentence because it shows that Saeng can pass the test. Although she is not at her homeland she still has the ability to do things. As the plant that reminds of home returns and begins to grow Saeng will do the same. I think that it is a good sentence to be at the end and it leaves you wondering if she will pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2184	4	She end, the story with that because the flower gives her strength. It gives her hope and reminds her of home. At her home they were every where, she had to buy this one. She planted it so it can grow through winter. After winter the flower gets huge and she passes her driver test. For reward her mom get her a real Vietnam flower.	1	1		1																					
2186	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed her driving test the first time and she was saying to herself that she will take it again.	1	1		1																					
2188	4	The author concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus � the way she did because she wanted to show saeng �s determination at one point in the story, the author wrote, �she was still too shaky to say the words at home �.  Saeng really missed her old life and her old country. She often wonders when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself, because she still has trouble adjusting to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that saeng could be shown as a person   who would not easily give up. Although she�d had   previous trouble, the end of the story gives new hope for saeng to adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives newhopes saeng told her mother,�I failed the test �, and she was really down on herself when she said so. The closing sentence gives new hope to saeng and the reader,  that she will work header and do better in the spring. The author shows saeng�s determination to rise above failure   and create a niche of her own in life. In all, the closing sentence in �winter Hibiscus� is used to show saeng�s determination.	3	3		3																					
2192	4	The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about over coming obstacles and is telling the reader to try again. It is important to never give up and to keep trying until you sucede. In the story Saeng had just moved away from Vietnam she really missed it, and on top of it saeng failed her drivers test. She was really upset. She saw a group of geese flying above her and said when they come back in the spring and my new plant starts to grow I will retake my drivers test. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter. The cold weather is an obstacle for them. Also her new plant can't grow until its warm. Her plant has to over come being small until it can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time. You have to keep trying inorder to get around them.	3	3		3																					
2193	4	The short story �winter Hibiscus end the way it does because the narrator realizes that with simply comes a new chance or opportunity to start over a rebirth. One passage from the text that shows the narrator�s hope, �Almost reluctantly, she realised that many of the things that he had thought of as strange before, through that quiet repetition of season upon season,almost familiar to her now (Ho @NUM1). This passage of text shows that she realized that alot of things to her before suddenly had purpose. She realized that there is a new rebirth in the spring. The conclusion sentences states that she is going to retake the test in the spring. She now realizing that she now by a whole new opportunity and life to start. The conclusion sentence of �Winter Hibiscus� is one of realization of opportunity with spring beginning.	2	2		2

2202	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story that paragraph because, she wants to show the determination the girl in the story possess. At first, the girl could not help herself and bought the expensive flower. She did not want her mother to be disappointed though, so she was determined to ""pass the test."" In the spring when it is time to buy more seeds, the girl wants to be able to buy the seeds. So the author is showing the trait of determination that the girl controls."	1	1		1																					
2209	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will follow  nature  and  try to  fit  into her  new  land. Saeng  has failed  her  driver�s   test  and  feels  out  of place  in  her  new home. The text states, �As  Saebba  nedae  tall  and  lush. And  surrounded  there  garden� (No 1).When  she  sees  the @CAPS1 it reminds her of old home where she fit in.Now she  wants to wait to see  that flower  grown  so when she takes the driver�s test again.Also,she sees geese fly over her head when she plants he r flower. The  author  writes. ��She  realized  that  many  of  the  things that she had thought strange before  had become�almost  familiar  to  her how�(No @NUM1).The geese coming back in the spring will now  also  remind her  of  her  new  name  and  how  must  try  to  live  there happily now. In the last paragraph the  author writes,� I will take that test again�(No @NUM1).This gives the feeling of Saeng  trying to start a  new  beginning in this new home.  	3	3		3																					
2210	4	This is a powerful sentence that demonstrates themes in the story. Saeng is determined to try again because she has been comforted by symbol of her homeland. This sentence shows what the plant has done for Saeng�s spirit and shows how that symbol helps heal her. The sentence is able to wrap up the story and demonstrates the importance of the hibiscus. In the story @CAPS1 describes the plant as a friend and remmeder of her homeland. Once she sees the plant in bloom she`ll know that she can take the test again. The paragraph is a great conclusion to the passage because it summarizes everything that the hibiscus has meant for Saeng.	2	2		2																					
2212	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hisbiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� because the paragraph its self concluded already. It basically sumed up what she was going to do all over again next time because she had already done it. What the author means by this paragraph is that when the plants come back in the spring she is going to have to do all the work again which was basically the test.	0	0		0																					
2233	4	"In the story ��winter hibiscus by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.�� @CAPS1 is shows that you should fight. For whats right and what you belive in."	0	0		0																					
2237	4	 The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told al ready & the future is a whole different story. It doesn�t matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother	1	1		1																					
2238	4	Saeng feels out of place in her new home and new country. She vows silently that in a year she will take the test again. She vows that in a year she will be used to her new home and new country and will start to enjoy life again. The author concluded with this paragraph because the girl Saeng will hopefully enjoy her new home and in a year she will be used to what happens in her new country. Saeng just feels out of place and she wants to wait a while until she tries to retake the test. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she made a vow to herself and hopefully she will keep the vow and make it happen.	2	1		2																					
2239	4	The author might of concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isnt @CAPS1 to stop trying shes @CAPS1 to work harder. As she sees the Geese adapting she chooses to try. and make their wew home work out. After they disapear she picks herself up and says that shes @CAPS1 to try again. By doing this she is commiting herself to try @CAPS2 things t adapt to changes.	2	2		2																					
2241	4	The story concludes with this paragraph for a number of reasons. First, in the spring it is warm and sunny and this helped to end the story in a happy note. Next this shows that Saeng can adapt to her new home, as the hibiscus will through winter. Finally, it shows Saeng is determined and won't let her mother down. That is why the story concludes with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2243	4	Authors often end stories with paragraph that make readers wonder what happens next. In Winter Hibiscus by: Minfong Ho there is an ending paragraph just like that. The author ends it like this because she is looking towards the future. She says that she will take the test when the snow melts, the gesse come back, and the hibiscus bluming. She is looking at it like that is a new beggining. She wants to start over. Also the gesse, blooming hibiscus, and melted show gives her hope that she will pass her test. She belives now they have a hibiscus maybe it will be more like where she use to live. Authors use endings that make people wonder so people think. 	2	1		2																					
2244	4	The response that the author concludes the story with this peragraph because  the author wanted us that read the story to understanding what was going on in the story. like for the @CAPS1 they was sayin when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibicus is budding then I will take that test again, was tryin to see where everybody head at in the story so they can understanding what the author be talkin about.	0	0		0																					
2246	4	The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant makes her think of where she is from and helps her to succeed a certain things. I know that the hibiscus is from her homeland because in the story she says �I mean, not like the kind we had at�at-�, she found that she was still to shaky to say the words at home.� She misses being home and this plant helps her bring back memorys of being there. Therefore the author included that paragraph to show the reader that she misses her homeland.	1	1		1																					
2260	4	I think that the author concludes the story like that because @MONTH1 be she�s saying that by that time she�ll be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @MONTH1 be by that time when that happens in spring she would be preprared and more confident of herself. @MONTH1 be the author was trying to say that just like the begining of a new springs, it would be a new beginning for her.	2	1		2																					
2261	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2268	4	In think the author is trying to show that Saeng is finally starting to accept and get over the struggles in the life. It is showing that she has finally gotten used to @LOCATION1 and the customs, but she still hasn�t forgotten her heritage. �But she had herself much preferred it to a big Mac.� It also proves that she is going to be positive and not let disc overage her. She�s going to retake it and try again. During the beginning look on her situations in life. But after visiting the floral shop, she discovers a more cherry. Optimistic outlook on her situation and decides to do something about it.	2	2		2																					
2270	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of what about her test? Needed to be answered and that�s when she'd to comfortable to take it. In the text. To her, the plant felt smooth and cool just as she had known it, which was comforting. She closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, with sadness, and maybe disapointment, which she probably word want to deal with for a while, hinted at in the conclusion her mother even uttered a small cry of surprise and delight to see the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid all of over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I believe that she will be more comfortable at the time. planned because she'll have new and old things to come home to, such as the geese and plant.                	2	1		2																					
2271	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author includes this ending paragraph because she wants to show that next time around she will be prepared and ready for the garden and the challenges it holds. This first time, she wasn�t ready, and she didn�t know about the winter hisbiscus because she never did anything like it before.	0	0		0																					
2274	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It�s explaining moments in time. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is.	0	0		0																					
2285	4	Determined, new beginning, symbolism � each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she�s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, �and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,� it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism � each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.	2	3		3																					
2290	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng�s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2293	4	"In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, a young girl named saeng recalls her life before she moved to @LOCATION1 .She misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng vowed to take her drivers test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason. He/She wants to show that saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. Saeng�s mother states, ""�it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months�. That�s what matters"". The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months."	2	3		3																					
2301	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story Saeng went to take a driving test but didn�t pass and so she goes and buys a hibiscus that reminds her of home and gives her strength and comfort. So her mother says this at the end because she knows Saeng is going through a hard time adapting to her new country and she doesn�t want to put more pressure on her just because she knows Saeng is very upset and is trying to make it up to her by buy a flower for her so she says by next spring she should be adapted and ready for the test because the flower should give her hope. She wants her to know she is three for her.	1	2		2																					
2307	4	The author concludes this the story with this paragraph   because its start a whole new  day time . That saying  means  that  she  will  take  the  test on a budding  new day .for  example, the   geese  return  her its spring and  hibiscus budd  and  she  has the test  in  the spring  so it  will  start  why the author concludes the  story  with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2311	4	"I believe that the author ends because the author is showing that Saeng is determined to pass the test. ""She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes. ""(Ho) This quote shows that passing the test meant a lot to Saeng. She was crying because she couldn't help but buy the plant and fail the test. She didn't want to fail and showed her sadness by crying.� then I will take the test again.� (Ho) This quote shows that even though she failed, she is determined to pass the test and succeed. Failing hurt her greatly. so she can't wait to do it again and pass because she is determing to succeed. This is all important because Saeng shows that determination is the key to success and she is determined."	1	2		2																					
2313	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was upset that she moved. She is also upset that she failed her drivers test. So she planted the plant and shes says that when spring comes, she will retry her drivers test	1	1		1																					
2316	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.�	0	0		0																					
2320	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test.	2	1		2																					
2322	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think that the author includes this paragraph to show how persistant Saeng is. Saeng is persistant because she trys over and over again at this �test� and also she trys to get used to her new country. It demonstrates this in the story when it says the quote above. This quote shows that Saeng can try something and fail, then be determined to try and succeed again. Also in the story, Saeng has moved from one country to another. This is a huge jump and for her to be confident with herself is very persistant. The way the author concludes the story, with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� definitely portrays Saeng, the main character as a persistant person, and that is the purpose of the quote.	2	2		2																					
2324	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. The author wanted to convey a sense of hope to show the growth of her character, and to show how thing are  going to change. In the last paragraph when she vows that she will take that test again it gives you a sense that everything will be okay. Earlier in the story she had been crying and missing her homeland the tone was troubled and sad. This last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful. Even though she failed the test she is still going to try again. The author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grow. Saying that she will try again shows how much stronger determed she is lastly, she had the story end with that paragraph to foreshadow what is to come.The geese coming back and the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding all show a change in the seasons. This represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on.	3	3		3																					
2325	4	The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal. It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think.	1	1		1																					
2326	4	I think the author add this paragraph because it a sign of a new start for her. Because she has hard time no doesn�t main the she will alway have hard times.	0	0		0																					
2327	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because It meant a lot to Saeng. Saeng failed her driving test and scared to tell her mother that she also spent nineteen dollars for �Dok Faeng-noi which was a flower/plant they had back at home. For example, �As Saeng walks home after failing her driver�s test, she sees a familiar plant.� The plant Saeng saw meant a lot to her mother. �@PERSON1 uttered a small cry of surprise and delight.� Dok faeng-nor� she said. �where did you get it.� That was a quote stating that her mother was excited to hear that. The story is concluded by that paragraph because after all saeng went through her mother was glad she bought it. �It�s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng- noi,� she finally said. �I�m glad you got it.�	1	1		1																					
2329	4	The  author  of  the  passage  ends  the  story  with this  statements  to  creates curiosity. Thi creates curiosity through writing for the spring and the geese to return.Spring is the beginning for many creatures on  the earth  therefore ,Saeng  is  trying  to  start  over  because  she  must  wait  for  the spring. The hibiscus reinforces the feeling of a new beginningin that each year new bad grow just  like  she can have a second chance. Saeng  waits for  the  spring  because she knows that is when every thing else creates new life so Saeng must wait till then to get her new beginning	2	2		2																					
2331	4	The author includes this scentence, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show her determination. She is determined to pass the test. Even if she is facing problems adapting to @LOCATION1 she wents to sucseed here. So she will wait a year and then try again when she is better prepared.	1	1		1																					
2336	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, iN the spring, wheN the @CAPS1 melt and the geese RetuRN and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� means to the author kinda like the meaning to life. That if you mess up its okay just try again and do better.	1	1		1																					
2341	4	The author concludes this in the story to show tone. The paragraph shows how Saeng was determined to try again a pass. This teaches a lesson to the reader. Lessons to try your hardestand don�t give up. The last paragraph ends the story with a sence of curiosity. It makes you want to no more or if she passes.	1	1		1																					
2344	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with  the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because it emphasizes Saeng pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes Saeng�s resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads �And besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.� This excerpt demonstrates Saeng�s love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news �I-I failed the test� @CAPS1 attention instantly was drawn to the flower and her mother could only be good. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is Saeng�s source of stength as it�s the only thing she knows in the united states. Saeng wants to show the same resolve on her test that the  flower shows in the harsh winter."	2	2		2																					
2356	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One reason is because It leaves you knowing that Saeng will never give up tring. Another reason is that something as simple as a flower can encourage someone to keep going even if they have nothing to go for. Saeng says that flower is something so important, that working harder will encourage her to keep doing the best she can. The author leaves you with this sentence because it is very powerful and brings Saeng courage.  	2	1		2																					
2366	4	The author concludes her story with this statement for many reasons. First the Hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing. therefore, Saeng will be strong too. Also, Saeng is giving herself time to adjust and get used to her new surroundings. She is setting a real goal for herself. Saeng is identifieng with the flower. It gives her comfort, and brings back valuable memories of the things she loved and the things that made her happy, like her home country, and her grandmother.	1	2		2																					
2368	4	In the story, I believe Saeng is sad because she misses her home and the hibiscus flower. She ends the story off well because she can now have a since of peace with herself by waiting to take the test again. I believe that�s why she ended the story like she did so she doesn�t leave herself worried or angry. She can turn a negative attitude into a positive one when she says she will retake the test when the geese return and hibiscus is budding.	2	1		2																					
2379	4	The reason  why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because they wanted the reader to know there will be another story that will be made up. Also to show that Saeng was not happy that the snow melted and the geese return and the hibiscus was budding.	1	1		1																					
2382	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl. By vowing to take the �test� again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality.	1	1		1																					
2385	4	In the concluding statement Saeng states that �when they come back In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The author concludes the story with this passage because she is using the hibiscus as an example of survival. The hibiscus isfrom another place like her, and she is using it to represent her well being in the new place. In a way she is saying , If the hibiscus survives this winter, than so will I. I believe she uses this as a conclusion to depict her unsure nature towards her new home.	2	3		3																					
2387	4	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower�s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower�s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages	3	3		3																					
2388	4	The  reason  the author was inspired was because of the flower. The flower had the ability to survive harsh winters and adapt to and new environments. She decides that she was going to over comes its obstacles just as the flower over comes its obstacles every winter.	2	1		2																					
2390	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it had gotten colder and all the plants and flowers were going to die.	0	0		0																					
2393	4	The author does this because they are comparing to the plant. The author does this because when the plant starts to bloom then the character�s confidence will come back. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it gives the story some meaning.	1	1		1																					
2395	4	I think this Author put this last paragraph in this story is to show everyone how determined she is to pass this test and how much it means to her to do it so that is what I think Why the Author Would put this in the story 	1	1		1																					
2396	4	The  author  concludes  the  story  of  paragraph  with the paragraph because it show the connection of nature and the girl. The paragraph says,��when the snow  melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again�(No @NUM1).In spring when all of these events take place. Spring is the  sign  of  life  and  birth  or  renewal. The geese come back. They are �renewed� in a symbolic sense. When the snow melts you can see the grass again which is a sign of life. When plants bud they are born. The  character  decides  when  nature  is symbolically reborn  and  renewed she  will start again just like nature.	2	3		3																					
2401	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test. She made a vowe to herself that is show determination to overcome. It @MONTH1 also make us want to read make and find out if she test her vowe and if she passed the test. For example it ends in �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again.	2	1		2																					
2406	4	He is referring to the lifestyle of Saeng and the stuff they do. And what the area is like weather wise.	0	0		0																					
2407	4	The author decided to finish the story with that phrase to show that she will wait for her next year and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and prove that she can do it one more time and that she is used to live there now.	0	0		0																					
2410	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn�t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that�s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things.	1	1		1																					
2412	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is Finally comfortable with her new �home.� After the passage is mostly a reflection of Saeng�s old life, it ends this way to signify that she has become accustomed to her new way of life. For example, it says �in the spring, and the geese return�� that shows that she is now used to the geese and the nature of her new world. The author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release. Saeng had so many memories locked inside her old life, that she couldn�t grasp new ones in her new home. The authors use of this paragraph is a good way to close out the story because it lets the reader feel the relaxed scene of the birds flying away; Saeng escaping  her pain and becoming  a real part of her new world.  	2	3		3																					
2415	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" Saeng finds comfort in the plant after she failed her test. The plant reminds her of home and connects her with her past experiances. Even though she failed the test the first time she feels that if she studies and trys again she can pass. This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again. Saeng feels a connection with the plants rebirth and feels she can start over again to and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng vowes to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms."	2	2		2																					
2417	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as a way to say that in due season she will take the test that she failed in the belief that the hibiscus will help her to overcome the obstacles. I believe that she she bought the plant when she failed the test, that she hope that with the blossoming of the plant, I will give her a time table as to when she is ready to try again.	1	2		2																					
2422	4	Why the author concluds the story with ths paragraph because its telling the seasons and how they change and how they come and go and they start of with a new season then its something different. An I think thats why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus cause after spring is winter & when it was spring they have all the nice beautiful flower thats smell good. An when spring gone its winter so all the plants had died out they not going to be the same how they used to be.	1	1		1																					
2425	4	The author concludes the sentence on the end to state when the plants start over growing and the geese come back, she will try again. For example, the plants have to grow their pedals back and the geese have to make their home and find food again. The author is saying she will take the test again when the geese come back and the plants grow again.	1	1		1																					
2435	4	The author concludes the story with this because she is say that she is going to grow with the season chang. She is in a new country and just failed her drivers test. She feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home. In the story @CAPS1 mother says �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake its strong enough to make it through the winter. I think that Saeng can relate to that because if the flower can make it in the winter tha she can make it in a new country.	2	2		2																					
2443	4	The author concluded the story with this sentence because shes letting people know that she enjoys nature more than school.	0	0		0

2449	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, �I failed the test,� (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence.	1	2		2																					
2452	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author�s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph.	1	2		2																					
2454	4	The author concludes the story with �In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� because Saeng fails the test by spending her money on a big mac and not having enough for the type of flower her mother sent for. So since Saeng failed the test, she wants to take the test again and make her mother happy.	0	0		0																					
2459	4	The author concluds the story with this paragraph to show that next spring she will have anoter chane. The author shows that Saeng will relate to the blooms or the hybiscus plant and take the test again. The author does this to leave a clif haber and it shows there is more to Saeng�s life but it is still to come. In the story Saeng is trys to get used to change and that she is have a hard time. Her moter holes cheer her up but just like the winter comes. Saeng will Have next spring to take the divers test again.	1	2		2																					
2461	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows saeng being mature about it and being confident knowing she can take it again. When it says � saeng vowed silently to herself she thought about everything and the phrase is almost like she is going to start over.	1	1		1																					
2465	4	"The author concluded this story with this paragraph because she wanted show how the flower gave the little girl strength. The girl was in a new place and back at home where she is from there are alot of beautiful flowers that she loved to look at and being in a new place that doesn't have these flowers really gets her down and has her upset. She misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers. For example, the girl says, �It�s-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", here she stops because she is so upset that she can�t say home. The flower she has right now isn't real but when the real one blossom in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her confidence to retake the test."	2	2		2																					
2468	4	"I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. This final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea. It tells us that in the spring when everything is coming to life Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in thelast paragraph show how Saeng and her mother have adapted and that new things are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text it says, �I know"", her mother said quietly. �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. It�s flower aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.� This means and represents that even though life is different here away from Saeng home they will adapt and survive in their own way."	2	2		2																					
2470	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng , was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saeng�s mother says, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,�� I think Saeng�s mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng Its almost as if she�s saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change likes anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try hander to pass it next time. Saeng  isn�t going to give up and she�ll keep holding on to make it through Saeng knows it�s hard to adjust to changes to life�s but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, she�ll be able to get situated in this new place.	2	3		3																					
2471	4	when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. That is in there for many reasons. One is because when winter comes and brings all the snow it kills her garden. So thats why she wants it to be spring again so she can start growing things agian in her garden. She got to take a test on the things that she is growing to make sure it is @CAPS1 for someone to eat it. Thats why I think the paragraph �when the come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	0	0		0																					
2477	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show her determination. When she says. ��when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Saeng is explaining how the geese have the determination to fly back and that the hibiscus has the determination to bud again so why shouldn�t she have the determination and confidence to take the test again. Saeng said, �I-I failed the test.� It seems as if failing the driving test made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country. But after she saw the geese�s and hibiscus�s determination through harsh conditions, she was determined to try the test again.	2	2		2																					
2480	4	The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driver�s test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, �aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her. �Through the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. �The pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng�s mouth watered,�, �The winter hibiscus� was in the ground now�, and, �overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and � yes � Familiar to Saeng now.� This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saeng�s newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to thrive in it. 	3	3		3																					
2493	4	"The author used ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because its resembling that her mother is refreshing, waking, and restoring its self. And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that happens. She was really sad she failed. �I � I failed the test� She seemed to be embarrassed + sad. So that last paragraph does a good job describing what Saeng is going to do. She is going to look on the bright side of things and restore her self to come back and pass the test"	2	2		2																					
2496	4	Why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because I think it�s showing how much it actually means to her and shows that she does actually care And by showing that she care's will take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2497	4	She ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to let everyone know she feels most comfortable in the spring. It also states that she can not wait for the geese and the hibiscus to start budding because it is her favorite time of the year.	1	1		1																					
2502	4	I think That The author concludes the story with This paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there. By saying shell do the test again shows that she doesnt want to let ths defeat her in her new home and her new life.	2	1		2																					
2503	4	The author concludes saeng vow in the story to show that saeng can and does have the ability to overcome obstacle. Saeng  feels like she is a failer. Her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her driving test that she failed. The geese represent survial and to never give up, to keep trying your hardest to success.	2	1		2																					
2507	4	"The author concludes the story with his paragraph to show how people can regain their determination. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. When she sees the Hibiscus, she is filled with memories of the past and weeps. Her mother's kindness causes Saeng to draw strength from the flower, which, as her mother says, is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" @CAPS1 that the Hibiscus will bud in the spring, Saeng renews her determination to pass the test. "	2	2		2																					
2508	4	The author ends with this response  because he is trying to say that Saeng will repeat her self but this time more helpful in the garden and her mother.Try harder with her school work and less focusing on gardening.	0	0		0																					
2511	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph �Saeng vowed silently to herself� because she Saeng wants to do in proper time and season. �winter season�, the land or soil was so cold that plants was not able to grow properly. �Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars�, and she Saeng failed the test. �There was frail, wiry beauty to her Saeng mother that touched Saeng deeply�, she Saeng mother is shining when she worked to plants. These all are the description that concludes in the past which want to make correction and shine like her mother and also to pass the test.  	1	1		1																					
2521	4	In the story � Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a well mannered carhoined. The author ended with that paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to persuade even though for away from home. She is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story she had failed a test and the hibiscus test her feeling nostalgic. When she got home her mother greeted her with kinds words kind of acting as an anti-depressent by making her food will not peppers and bitter melons. This kind of made Saeng see the good in life causing her not to give up and be confident that she will pass the test.	3	2		3																					
2522	4	"Well in the story, Saeng  fails her driving test. When she is walking home she sees a familar plant, she then goes to a flourist and finds out the plant is called a hibiscus. She then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother who she left behind so now she is connected to the plant. Also she sees geese fly over head heading south for the winter, so she says �When they come back,� so she means when the geese fly north for @DATE1. And when �the snow melts"" so when it becomes warmer and starts spring. When �this hibiscus is budding,� so when spring comes and the plant starts to bloom she will �take that test again"" so she says she will take the driving test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test . She vows to herself that come spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass."	2	2		2																					
2529	4	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.	2	2		2																					
2531	4	In �@CAPS1 Hibiscus� by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. �And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. �She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.� She can�t say home because home isn�t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion�s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does	3	3		3																					
2547	4	The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One reason is to show Saeng is not going to give up and keep trying to pass her test. Another way is to show that even though your life has changed that don�t mean that you have to give up. These are some of the way that the author concludes the story like he does.	1	1		1																					
2549	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng feels like that will be the right time to take over her driving test over and when the hibiscus is budding. And another reason would be because the authors wants to show her determination,	1	1		1																					
2551	4	Why I think the auther concludes the last paragraph in the story because it's kind of like a moral to the story. Shes trying to say that when the time is right she will try it again untill she gets it right. Without this last paragraph you wouldn't be able to understand the message of the story.	0	0		0																					
2559	4	In the story the author concludes with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think she did that to say that you shouldn�t give up. In the story Saeng goes to the store and �touched a petal.� She buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home. In this way it seems Saeng is willing to give up her memories of her past. When she brings home the plant and her mom and her plant it in the garden. I think Saeng is trying to make her new home like her old.	2	2		2																					
2562	4	The reason why I belive the author concluded the story like that, is because, she is going going to aways start over. For instants in the story she said I�I failed the test. From that known she throught she was going to give up. So that is why I belive he ended the story with that line	1	1		1																					
2563	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because the author is trying to say that Saeng is going to start all over again just like the hibiscus would. Even though you go through bad times in your life just step and do it over again until it becomes better. The author also concluded the story with that paragraph because the paragraph pretty much starts the story all over again that like Saeng was going do.  	2	2		2																					
2570	4	I think that the author uses this quote, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.� @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. �But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?� �BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.� @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable. 	3	3		3																					
2577	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself ,in the spring ,when snows melt and geese return and  this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again� . The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this makes you think about the story after your done reading it.	0	0		0																					
2584	4	"The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of realization, and new beginnig for Saeng. She spent so much time missing the past, that she didn�t know how to enjoy the present, which theme-wise the author is saying �live in the moment�. The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said,""It's strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that�s what matters. the author is say ultimately that tough times are irevitable, so hold on to the moments that make you smile, for they will help you perservere through the times that are tough."	3	2		3																					
2590	4	"The author brought out the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", to portray the theme of the story. Saeng used the hibiscus for hope in her life. The author also uses the choice of words or diction to explain the way Saeng lived her life depending on a flower. The paragraph also explains the way her culture is depending on the theme of the story."	1	1		1																					
2604	4	Then author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sums up how the memories and the plant effects her. Just like the plant Saeng grows better in her own country and likes it better there but she can still survive in a new place if it is taken care of and fights to stay beautiful. The ending shows that Saeng realizes that if she trys harder she can survive like the plant, so she is going to take the test agian. Her mother say, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.� Her mother is trying to tell the daughter its ok and she get through the hard times. In the end Saeng knows she can.	2	3		3																					
2611	4	In the story the test was if she could overcome her homesickness. When she want to the greenhouse all of the. plants and flower brought back memories of her homeland. When she saw the flower it reminded her of the times life she would get water from the well and and a flower was floating in it. So after the winter she would go back to the place and see if she was still homesick. I feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again  	3	3		3																					
2616	4	Saeng promises herself that  �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agan.� The hibiscus is meta phorica to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of her homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, �that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become� almost familiar to her now.� She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable.	1	1		1																					
2621	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself �I will take that test again,� shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng�s good character. It shows Saeng�s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	1	2		2																					
2624	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter the hibiscuses are dying. Also she is leaving and wont come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, and she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2627	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows how sometimes you have to wait till the time right for you to try again... For example, In the book it says �Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, �How strang to see it in apat,� Back home it just grew wild jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs.� This shows that anything can be done when the time is right.	1	2		2																					
2628	4	Emotions,symbolizim, to it realized � all are reasons the author concluded the story that way. a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you, with mixed emotions. Emotions like sadness, hope, and wounder. The author makes the reader feel sad with the girl failing her test and missing home. The author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered. the author uses symbolizes in the concluding, sentances by giving the plant and the geese a sense of impotance in the story and the plant has to do with the home that she really misses. In the final story the author leaves a lot of peceptions on several. Like the importance of the plant and why did they move from a place that they lavd so much. That is why I think the author ended the story that way.	2	1		2																					
2631	4	The reason why the author of the story ended the story like that is because after all the hard time that plant went through, it will still bad at the end of the winter. The author said that the plant will take that test again that test is surviving through the could winter and blunming at the end of the winter	1	1		1																					
2637	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus is motivating her to test for her drivers test. In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. 	1	1		1																					
2638	4	Several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life. Also when the hibiscus starts budding she will feel conforted, as though it auomaticaly brings back her childhood memories. It also is a link to her past home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again. Its as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, she will also be ready.     	2	2		2																					
2640	4	The author put the paragraph in to show the he/she care about the flowers. Flowers only come out during spring and @DATE2 time and thats when you plant study all that grows in a garden. So she can pass the test and be happy with the garden.	1	0		1																					
2647	4	The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and relizes what it symbolizes to her. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscas herself so that she holds the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this manner.	1	1		1																					
2662	4	There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home. This is shown when she says �a blossom of two would have blown into the well� It reminds her of her homeland. It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she said�she realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.� This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing.	2	2		2																					
2664	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed the driver's test. She is saying when it get's a little warmer outside and the plants grow in maybe she will then take the test again and hopefully pass. I know that she failed the test because it said"" As Saeng walks home after Failing  her driver's test"". I guess that from the snow  being on the ground cause her to  make mistakes when taking the test. In conclusion, that�s why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.."	1	1		1																					
2672	4	"The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with this sentence when they come back saeng vowed silently to her self in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The Winter Hibiscus symbolizes her fondness of the place she used to live before. Its not a real one I�m mean not the kind we had at-at� she was still too shaky to say the words at home� when the hibiscus buds� she will still be fond of her home but she will have adapted better to her current enviroment. The geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day. When she finds that place she will find herself ready to �take the test"" or do things normally. The author concluded the story with the that sentence to show that Saeng will eventually grow into her new life."	3	2		3																					
2673	4	The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Like the geese are coming back she is positive that she can take the test again. She knows that she will pass the test. In the story she said �Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet reptition of season upon season, almost familiar to hernow� This means that when she had just moved here she thought that everything was strange because, she have not seen anything like this before. Now as she is living here to would get use to it because, she knows what will happen nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now	1	2		2																					
2676	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well, but leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action.	1	1		1																					
2678	4	When they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author�s main porpuse of this lines wa to grab the readers attention by making a continuing paragraph that a closing she�s adapting to circumstances. Saeng values the uniqueness of plants, she is also conforted by memories of her homeland	1	1		1																					
2692	4	The author @PERSON1, concludes the story ��Winter Hibiscus with that paragraph to show Saeng starting over��� In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�@CAPS1 to her life, is that she is starting fresh in a way. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, She is making on effort and ��take that test again��� By relating the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to the �� @CAPS2 of loss.�� and to her grief.     	2	2		2																					
2694	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng . After failing the drivers test, saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort  to  help  her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence  she decides to plant it. �The �winter hibiscus� was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. �Then she sees geese flying in the sky which  is kind of a symbol do that day, something to rembember  it by, so the next year.� When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� She will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger.	3	2		3																					
2695	4	I think Saeng need to take the test over because to get her grade up. Saeng be waring about the snow, in the spirng because she is think about the flower getting cover over it. Saeng mother late her help with the pepper and melons, and lat her state dinner.	0	0		0																					
2696	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she�s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she�s not giving up ��then I will take that teat again� which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2705	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph I think because since the girl failed her test the bud reminds her of her grandmothers long grey hair and I guess that gives her good luck so when the winter passes by and the spring time hits thats buds start to come back out and thats when she will take her test again. Thats why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story.	1	2		2																					
2709	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Maybe to show confidence that she would do everything over again if she had to. For example ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", so basically she's saying she's willing to take that step, that chance . The author ended the story with this confidence and couragement.."	1	1		1																					
2716	4	I say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy. She was still going to take it again, she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day from failing her driver�s test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower so she went to a florist to see if she can buy it. When she does purchase it she goes home and gives it to her mom and they plant it. So maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck I think.	1	2		2																					
2721	4	The author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an end. Wit  this saeng tell @LOCATION1 that all the snow is gone she will take the test again. If one read   now between the lives it   says more than just this. She really likes the hibiscus and when the hibiscus goes back to life in the spring, she will have new energy to take the test again. From her experience with the hibiscus we can see that this plant really influent her. Because this  plant reminds  her so much of her old home.  Also we can see that everything and everybody should get a second chance. In her case it is the test she wants to take again. Also in the spring she lives a couple month in the @LOCATION1 and she will adjust herself to this new situation. At the moment she is just homesick, even if her home is the @LOCATION1 now. So the hibiscus is good for her, it is some think she can hold onto from her old home� 	2	2		2																					
2724	4	The last paragraph means only one thing. That one thing is to be like a Hibiscus @CAPS1 to take the test again of life. See will come back in the spring just like the Hibiscus will. So as you can see the last paragraph had a very good meaning to it.	1	1		1																					
2726	4	"The reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again. When Saeng fails her driving test she is disappointed. After failing her test she went too greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland. Then where sh bought the hibiscus. It reminded her of how things were different. And how thing change when you go to different place. Sometimes they aren't so pleasant at first but you get use to them. Like when she first saw the geese flying in a ""V"". she though of how strange it was. But now it is farmiliar to her. After failing her driving test Saeng learns that even though things nav change she needs to be able to try again. "	2	2		2																					
2735	4	The author concludes the story like that to show emphasis.Saeng vowed that so that it will teach her everything lives with hope & adaptation. She means that when everything returns and proves they survive, she will too. She will take that drivers test then. The author also wants to prove that people need to have faith in theirselves. You just need to get used to their surroundings. This is why the author concluded that way.	1	2		2																					
2737	4	The author concludes in the story that Saeng failed a winter test and because of her love of the hibiscus plant spring will help her take test.	1	1		1																					
2741	4	The Author of �Winter Hibiscus� ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant �dies� in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle.	2	2		2																					
2745	4	The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the �metaphor� compares Saeng and her test to the perenial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathalon, and my goal was to place first, I place @NUM1 overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathalon came again, and I placed @NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.    	1	2		2																					
2749	4	She was upset with herself because she bought the hibicus and not the plant seeds. So she starts crying because she remembered how pretty their old one used to be. When the snow melts and the flowers start to bloom is when she is going to take the test again. The author ended the paragraph like that to show a new begining next year.	1	1		1																					
2754	4	By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story �winter Hibiscus,� the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of seang at her struggle to live in another country & her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating statement on the test saying � I will take that test again,� the author gives us that understanding that Saeng has not given up & lets the reader know she will stand & live strong.	2	2		2																					
2755	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is becaus now she has something to work for. The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph becaus she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could wait to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are reasons why i think the author put that conclude with the paragraph.	1	2		2																					
2756	4	The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simpley set a time for her to try again. Saeng wants to make it in this world and wants to have a good life, so she tries new things	1	1		1																					
2760	4	I believe the author chooses to end the story wit this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represent her home. But she realizes  by the sight of the geese, flying sooth that evenyone has to leave home at some point. She has now come to terms with what is happening and she will try again for her drivers liscence soon. When the hibiscus buds again it will by symbolic to her and that is when she will be ready to try once again.	1	2		2																					
2762	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks it�ll bring her good luck in the test. When she goes back to take the test she�ll have the comfort of her home land of the hibiscus plant to encourage her to pass the driving test. When she takes the test again she�ll ve mast to pass due to the comfort of home and she�ll be used to the area being different from her homeland. In order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little but more confident in herself. Having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can help her a lot in being confident in herself.	2	1		2																					
2764	4	I think that this snows hope because she had really missed her homeland and kind of found peace and serenity by being around them she says �That at least she could hold on to� meaning the bud I think that she was very upset because of missing home she missed having her grandmother wash her hair and put a dok mallk into it. I think that since she really had nothing else but the flowers that reminded of her homeland the text said �where was the fine toothed come the hibiscus hedge, the well. her gentle grandmother she was missing all these thing so I think that by putting her in this posistion it has brought her to a place of where she not only misses the people from her homeland but the beautiful things as well and how she always has kind of a part of home with her because of the flower.	2	2		2																					
2773	4	"The auther conclude the story by saying she will take the test again in the spring and uptill then vow silently because the spring reminded Saeng of home. In Vietnam there were many beautiful wild flowers. Sarng goes to the flower shop to get a peice of home. It said the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind.� This shows that the plant was not the same because there were also no buds. She had just failed her driving test before this and needed hope, so al waiting till spring when the hibiscus will bloom again that will give Saeng a sense of home which will give her hope to do good on the driving test. "	2	2		2																					
2776	4	The author @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because of the titel and the begening of the story. Or he @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because he wants to. He @MONTH1 have concluded the story like that to show what @MONTH1 happen. But is good conclusion is a good conclusion. 	0	0		0																					
2777	4	I really do not know why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Possibly because she started to talk.	0	0		0																					
2783	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, saeng vowed don't really like to talk. Saeng liked to be by her self sometimes. When spring come it was a different story. Saeng loved the spring and @DATE2. She would play outside all day every day. Saeng was just a nice girl	0	0		0																					
2784	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.	1	1		1																					
2795	4	"The find lines of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" are meant to provide a glimpse into the near future, to show a change in Saeng's attitude. Up until this point Saeng had been lamenting her old country, and not adjusting well to her new one. The Hibiscus inspires her, and lets her know that the new country has many of the same things as her old country. In this last line, she comes to terms with her present situation. ""When the snows melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" is a way of saying shes going to let a little time pass, and by taking her driver�s test again, she will begin her new life."	2	2		2																					
2798	4	The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and strgging to survive and fit in in it�s non-natve land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported through out the story when her mother connents on the hibiscus by the late. She says, �It�s strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matter� (Ho @NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saeng�s life. Both must be strong fight through hard imes where no, one, �not even her class mates or frends, or Mrs. Lambert� (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, shes promising herself she will fight through the hard times grow strong, just as her winter hibiscus.	3	3		3																					
2799	4	Primarily why she said that was she was saying with time come s cause. She was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well. I depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in Vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. That is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase. But I think as much I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and finally I believed Saeng said this because time brings change.	2	1		2																					
2803	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the hibiscus flower will be adaptating to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has began to grow older and much wiser of things allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now of where she is living just how the hibiscus flower adapts to it's place with ease and gets use to seasons.	2	3		3																					
2806	4	"The author includes this paragraph in the story because it shows a impression on work ethic and adaption to a new environment can be difficult. �not even @PERSON1, looked it."" makes something to dislike apparent to a student that is new don�t give them good. work ethic and that will essue them mentally also. Therefore the girl is not comfortable and not enthused To  working on something that none woud appreciate."	1	1		1																					
2811	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has something to work for.The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could want to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are the reasons why I think the author put that conclude with the paragraph	1	1		1																					
2821	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.	1	1		1																					
2825	4	The last line is included in the story �Winter Hibiscus� because it showed the connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time she decides to take it again in the spring. The hibiscus flower like Saeng is out of place and will have to make it through the winter into the spring so it can bud again. This shows how like the flower Saeng will bud again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions in @LOCATION1. So they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to. This shows again how the last line connects the girl and the flower together. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to wrap up the story with a connection between the flower and Saeng.	2	3		3																					
2832	4	I think the Author concludes this in the story because. It is a key information for this story. Because. It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom	1	0		1																					
2834	4	The reason I think that the author did it is because wanted you to know what time it took place and what the weather was like then it also so tells you how long she is going to wait like till the snow melts and that is going to be while and when the geese live and return home so this is why I think she tells you what is like.	0	0		0																					
2835	4	I think that this is about winter hiliscus and hedpe tall and lush bad surrounded their garden its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers, She said when she got to the hibiscus she reached out and touched a petal gently. 	0	0		0																					
2838	4	The author concludes the story with that paragrap for one main reason.	0	0		0																					
2842	4	 In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her � gentle grandmother� from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story �Winter Hibiscus � with the paragraph selected.	3	2		3																					
2845	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show she loved them flowers. That they met a whole lot to her. When she failed her driven test she was sad. An the flower made her feel better. now that the snow is failing she waits untill spring that when they come up and she will have faith and take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2855	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because when the hibiscus started budding it will give her inspiration to try and past the test again. In order to past the test she wanted to feel like she was home, And to have memories of her home to incourage her to try again. Therefore, this is the reason the author concludes the story with the last paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2857	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.	0	0		0																					
2860	4	In the �passage winter Hibiscus� by monfong Ho, the quote � when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again, it symbolizes @CAPS1 new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland @CAPS2 she states �I � failed the test.� This test meant more to then she just failing. She was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The � when they came back�� quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again.	2	3		3																					
2861	4	She will go back to where she started. Its a circle and she will be back the next year where she began.	0	0		0																					
2864	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home land she will eventualy pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misss the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.	2	2		2																					
2873	4	The author ends the story by saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story. When she gets home her mother �noticed the tear staie on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes.� Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story but by the end she felt happy and optimistic. 	2	1		2																					
2884	4	Its the start of a new life. She has a new new school and a new plant, Its is like she has a connection to the plant, when it grow she grows stronger and more confident. That�s when she said when they come back when the hibiscus is budding she will be ready for that test.	1	1		1																					
2889	4	"Guess that she is saying that when winter is gone she will prepared for that winter test again. I guess this because they were not prepared for the winter to come as they were planting. As in the reading she says, ""As if oblivious to the cold, he mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. Thats the reason why I believed that they were not prepared for the winter."	1	1		1																					
2893	4	In the story �winter hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, it tells of a girl who just moved to a new country & is having a hard time adapting to the new land & its people. But I think the author put that quote at the end to lead you to believe to never give up, there is a new beginning & you will make it. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her.� This shows that has finally has found comfort & is confident, like the geese going to adapt in a new area, & then will come back, & that the winter hibiscus new gives up & will keep living in the new weather conditions every season.	3	2		3																					
2894	4	She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph she says a whole thing it means she will look at it when the winter is done. She will be able to retake the test again in the spring. That is what she was writing about	1	1		1																					
2895	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new sorrounds. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place. In the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her. The spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming, the geese return, and the snow has melted. Saeng feels like she could adapt to her new surroundings with the comfort of her memories of her old life.	2	1		2																					
2904	4	"The author uses that passage to end the story to show that Saeng will try to adopt. When Saeng smells the Hibiscus �The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng [she] could almost feel. The light sounds of her grandmother�s long gray hair"" This @CAPS1 that Saeng was looking for things that were familiar to her and reminded her of her homeland. The fact that Saeng paid over nineteen dollars for a plant also @CAPS1 how much she missed her homeland. ""d-d failed the test that Saeng paid.� @CAPS1 the reader that she attempted to adapt to her new home but failed. This makes her sad and causes her to miss the way things used to be. at the end of the story she said that ""I [she] will late the test again."" seeing the familiar hibiscus and geese leaver knowing that they will return gives Saeng hope. the last time in the story @CAPS1 the regard they @CAPS2 will always remember her homeland  "	3	2		3																					
2907	4	The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life. The test might be one to see if she can understand her self. There changes in the weather all the time there changes in the spring fall she other that you just got to get over.	1	1		1																					
2911	4	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says �when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.� The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on.	2	2		2																					
2927	4	The author includes this last paragraph in the story, �Winter Hibiscus� to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to @LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.� Saeng�s mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in @LOCATION2 that she is not used to. �When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.    	3	3		3																					
2928	4	"The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with ""wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable. At time you caN see how she's triNg to adapt to new surroundiNgs. I believe that the hibiscus represeNts comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt and, a connectioN to her past expeirences. SiNce the hibiscus represeNts a comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt, is the reasoN she weNt out and purchased the plaNt. So wheN it SpriNg agaiN and the hibiscus is fully bloomed that why she take the test agaiN because she will feel more comfortable in and with her surroundiNgs.  That is why the author MiNfoNg Ho conclued the story the way he did."	2	2		2																					
2931	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted the readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test over again.	1	1		1																					
2940	4	The author of ,�Winter Hibiscus ,� concludes the story with the paragraph,� When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again .�The author most likely chose this as the last paragraph to help the reader  understand  the message. The message of this story is no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. The author makes that the last paragraph to make the reader think and ponder upon what it means.	1	1		1																					
2942	4	�When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows. Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that�s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers. Last of all Saeng she sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flowrist shop to see if it can be purchased and Saeng gets highly upset when something goes wrong with them.	0	0		0																					
2947	4	The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her drivers test for the first time when the hibiscus starts to bud it will represent a change in her life. Also, Saeng use to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam so when the flower buds it could show that she has a new home. 	1	1		1																					
2950	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph. She does because she is ready to do the same thing next year. She like spending time with her mom, she likes plants, she likes having fun with her mom. This are some reasons why she concludes with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2951	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes �she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs� after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of �combing her grandmother�s long grey hair, freshly washed� it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn�t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was �exquisite� and as she said the @CAPS1 word �dokor malik� meaning hibiscus she �savored the feel of the word on her tongue.� @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when �the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels.	3	2		3																					
2955	4	She compares the paragraph to the story to compare it to school. The test is makeing new friends and doing good on the test and classes. In the paragraph it said �Then I will take that test again.� That is the reason she is comparing that paragraph to school.  	0	0		0																					
2956	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the Saeng's determination to over come the obstacles of her past experience. For example, the story starts out with Saeng taking a �test�,  while reliving her memories in the greenhouse, she started to breakdown. �A wave of loss so deep and story it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" She then buys the plant and takes it home to her mother,telling her that she 'failed'. The mother then becomes understanding and helps Saeng's vow retake the 'test', the narrator emphasizes Saeng�s determination to overcome the troubles of her past and go on with the future."	2	2		2																					
2960	4	I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imagen what happens next once spring rolls around for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their imagenation to connect to the story. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that with that paragraph was to give hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time. It was also a way to end the story in a good note.	2	1		2																					
2963	4	The author concludes the story of the paragraph because, the author would like to finish the last sentence of the story. Also at the last of the paragraph is when she is visualizing and putting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are appreciated to the plant. The author wanted more evidence to the story. For example, when it said, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese ruturn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It includes the winter time for the plant. Also, the @DATE2 and spring the plant comes back, which the character saeng will get it back, and visit it.	1	0		1																					
2967	4	I think the author wrote that because maybe that how she fells like in the winter she could really show people who she is but when spring come out she like a flower that has been dead all winter  	0	0		0																					
2969	4	In the story the Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho it explains the obstacles Saeng went through coming to a different country. In this story Saeng had just failed her driving test as she was reminded of her home through some tropical flowers. Moreover the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.� This part of the story is very important because it examines her growth and hope for change, just us the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a buetiful blossed flower. Furthermore it explains to the each that she will not give up and that she will change to the environment just as th plant lives has and the geese come back to the changed environment. That part of the story is very important for the reader, @CAPS1 it concludes Saeng thoughts and hopes for the future wile adapting to her new enviorment.     	3	3		3																					
2973	4	The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story.	1	1		1																					
2976	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. Saeng is going to wait to take the test whe n she knows that she will past the test so she can get her licesned. Saeng wants her licesned so she can drive anywhere she wants to go. So she don't have to get her mom to take her everywhere she wants to go she can take her ownself anywhere she wants. But she has to wait till the snows is melted before she takes her test again.	1	1		1																					
2977	4	The paragraph shows that Saeng has a lot of feelings for her plants. She enjoys plants and she loves taking the time to spend with the plants. She means in that last paragraph that she cant wait for winter to leave so her plants will be budding and that she can enjoy her plants.	0	0		0																					
2983	4	"The author concludes with this story to show how Saeng is ready to accept her new life. Once the geese and the hibiscus are back she feel like she's at home. When she feels more at home is when she will be ready to take the test again. The text states �run and the geese return"" this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again�. Clearly the geese and hibiscus remind her of home.Once she feels at home, she will feel at ease. Thats why the author concluded with this pasage."	1	2		2

2988	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus� included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""It�s-it�s not a real one, �Saeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-at� she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on.� One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. �Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.� The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.� Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus."	3	3		3																					
2992	4	The Author concludes the with paragraph because she wont to.	0	0		0																					
3001	4	The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese.	1	1		1																					
3003	4	She ends it with this sentence because its a sign of new life. Just as the winter that killed the plants ending life, the spring will come and start anew. This is how Saeng feels because she left her country and all the memories left behind she feels out of place like the winter hibiscus but as the spring comes she�ll feel as anew person ready and able to take challenges as she said here �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now� she describes that with a new season comes new changes and upon those changes she will go on to take the drivers test again.	3	2		3																					
3006	4	She wrote that response to tell everyone   that  she  will  be ready  but the time when spring  comes.    Then   she  take it and pass.	1	1		1																					
3012	4	"Thes Author, In the story �Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph to show how often Saeng gets tested by her memories. Saeng has ""tested"" erlier in the story when she was in a flourist. Memories come rushing back to her like a flood and she tried to feel the same as she did long ago whe her grandmother was there, and she realized that things in her memories were long gone, so she wept. Saeng reported to her mother that she had failed the test, and bought the plant to try and comfort herself. Her mother was very understanding and accepted it. Saeng planted the habiscus and at the end says that ""In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". Saeng knew seeing the flower again will make her cry, will make her memories come back, she will be re tested."	2	1		2																					
3013	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho a girl named Saeng failed her drivers test that day then vowed that she would retake from the spring. She ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life. This archetype being the changing from harsh cold winter to nice warm spring time shows that the trouble her mother and Saeng would get better. As hard trouble winter left than their is calmwarm new beginning spring. Saeng knows this and knows that she is going to pass."	2	1		2																					
3014	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for various reasons. For example, the whole passage is talking about how the hibiscus flower provides Saeng with the ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort her in a time of disappointment. This ending paragraph shows that �in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding,� and everything is beautiful again then Saeng will take her test again. She knows that with the help of the hibiscus plant, that she will pass the test. It shows that her hope and trust to pass the test comes from the hibiscus flower. The plant with �waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers� will provide her the strength, determination, courage, and will power to pass the test in the spring.	2	2		2																					
3019	4	The author Minfong Ho concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus�, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, �.. in the spring...� it�s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It�s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  	3	3		3																					
3020	4	She ended it with that paragraph because she wanted to prove even though she misses the �old centry� she will adapt and survive.	1	1		1																					
3022	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and there is still hope. It is also to teach the reader to have hope and patience and the knowledge that things take time. Saeng failed the test of not giving into her sorrows and misery of missing her country. She says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This shows that she is adjusting. So by ending it with this and comparing to the geese, its showing that she is getting stronger. She will take the test again because she wont give up.	2	2		2																					
3027	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because she wants to come back an an do smell test again when the snow melts and the geese return.	0	0		0																					
3030	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph of ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because this paragraph can show that the hibiscus is the reason why Saeng wants to try the test again. If the hibiscus is budding after the snow melt and the geese return, then she can do as the hibiscus be strong and won�t give up on her test."	1	1		1																					
3031	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that saeng won�t give up. It is possible to adapt and try to love whats around you. Saeng struggled to get out �I-I failed the test� and couldn�t say �at home� this shows her insecurity and lonleiness for the new world around her and by saying she will try again in the spring gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an expirence today that old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now they have some simalarities and because she will try again in the spring means she has decided to go to give a new place a chance.	2	2		2																					
3035	4	The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girls cofidence in herself. It also gives her enough time to get ready for the next test. Also she knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud.	1	1		1																					
3049	4	The author concludes the story this way with a quote that says she will get another try at something. Many authors end stories at a diff way because it makes the reader wants to go on to a sequal or the next story, and I really adds a twist to the ending. Also another reason a author would end like that is because they want you to work your imagination so you picture what happens next. Using this is effective because you know what has happened and It make the reader wonder if she  fails or succeeds the next time around.	1	1		1																					
3052	4	The author concludes the story with this Paragraph because so you can get a view of what she is saying and also so you can understand it from her situration she was growing up like for example she said that	0	0		0																					
3057	4	In the end of the story they say that she will take the test over again, in the spring when the geese come back from the winter fly. What they are saying is that she will make a fresh start in the spring when the geese come back, so she would just be starting all over again fresh new start to a new year and a new time to study for the big test and time to regroup from the last test that she took and failed the test she will just get a new start and a new chance to do something over again. Her mom was in disbelief when she found out that she failed the test, her mom said to her that it will be ok and you can take it over again, in a new season,	1	2		2																					
3059	4	The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to end on a good note and show hope for the future. First, throughout the story Saeng felt lonely and depressed because she missed her home in Vietnam. With all this depression Saeng saw the winter hibiscus that reminded her of her childhood memories. She felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life. The flower represented the light and hope for the future. Next, it shows perserverance factor in the story Saeng fails her drivers test and came home feeling unacomplished. When she says she will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms it shows perserverance and never giving up. Lastly, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and show a positive outlook on life. No matter where you come from with love and perserverance you can overcome any obstacle. Whether it be your school, tests or home with a little hardwork and faith you can achieve.	3	3		3																					
3060	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show thatshe will do this once she  has gotten use to the change of her new country. When she says, �When the geese return� their faint honks and flying overhead are familiar to her now season upon season. Also when the hibiscus is budding because this will remind her of her home in Vietnam seeing flower and hearing these geese will give her the confidence and encouragement to retake the drivers test.	2	2		2																					
3065	4	The reason why the aurthor wanted to put that last paragraph down because they want to keep the reader interested in the story. Another reason why she/@CAPS1 put that in the story; @CAPS2/@CAPS3 it is letting the reader know that plant will never give up.	0	0		0																					
3066	4	The author concludes the story with the quote, �when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again,� to show that she is encouraged by the memories of her homeland. For example, in the story it stated that she realized that many things were similar to things in her homeland. As the seasons went by she discovered the similarities. The spring time reminded saeng of her home, so when at comes she will be motivated to take the test again. In conclusion, the author included the quote to show how she is encouraged by memories of her homeland.	1	2		2																					
3071	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is waiting for a better time. It shows that she is has perserverance and will not give up on passing this test. She realizes that life comes and goes very quickly. And thAt she needs to appreciate it	1	1		1																					
3078	4	The Author includes this paragraph to this story in many reasons why. One reason why is because the story started off by saying and talking about Saeng failing her drivers test and being depressed over it. Then it gets into talking about the hibiscus and how it reminds her of homeland and all of the good memories that she has experienced. This all relates to this paragraph because Saeng will not return to the testing again until the thing that makes her happy and confident, the hibiscus starts to bud. That paragraph relates to every little bit of this story from the beginning to the end.	2	2		2																					
3079	4	I think the author concludes this in the story because when they come back is when the character feels she would be prepare to take that test again.	1	1		1																					
3084	4	The author concludes the stoRy with this paragraph because this spRing she had made a mistake like buying the plants that were oveR @MONEY1 (dollaRs) and her motheR who disappointed with heR. So she figuRes That when The spRing comes again she could get another oppoRtuniy to do her best and to get it right This time. Also so she will not be a disappointment to heR motheR.	1	1		1																					
3085	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because she said that the flower helps her with the moving and remains her of her home town and that when the geese come back and the flower starts to blume she�ll know that she can pass that test. She is sad for failing the test but it doesn�t matter how many times you fail it sooner or later you will pass the test. She must feel comfortable taking the test again when spring comes along.	1	1		1																					
3086	4	I believe that the author concluded the story �Winter @CAPS1� with the paragraph that she did in order to imply that Saeng will not give up. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was very sad about failing the test, but will take the test again infers that Saeng is a determined person. It is my belief that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the feeling that Saeng was determined despite hardships.	2	1		2																					
3092	4	The author concludes that failing the test is not the worst thing. She relizes that times change and you can always get another chance, which is explaned in the last paragh that once the hibiscus buds she will take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3103	4	She say cloning the spring I will take the test again because she know if she failed the test againg her mother will be disappointed of her because she not trying hard enough or maybe them too him never be closer again. The mother think jst because she keep failing the test because of her connection to her past expeirences or effection for her new country. and ability to overcome obstacles ar finally I think she is comforted by memories or her homland..	1	1		1																					
3105	4	The author of this story story created the last paragraph so that it finishes the story with a great ending. The fact of never giving up and try again again and again. The author said, �I will take the test again.� In the story Saeng said, �I failed the test� but now that she isn't giving up. This last paragraph makes a lot of senses and is needed to make this story complete. So just as others don't give up in @LOCATION1, Saeng is doing the same and is retaking the test.	1	1		1																					
3106	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed. Since she has failed the test the first time she wants to overcome her failure and succede in it so the author wants her to look determined in the end.	1	1		1																					
3109	4	I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder. I think this because if you put into context the word �test�, it could mean many things. For example it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of her situation. Also it could mean the test to adjust to her new home when the spring comes. That is why I think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph.	1	2		2																					
3110	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho,is about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing �when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test @NUM1). The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on her way home had seen an assortment of flowers that were indigenous to her homeland. �Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost @NUM2) The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged. Her mother states �It�s flowers aren�t as pretty but it�s strong enough. That�s what @NUM3). Saeng , after hearing this, decides that she could be strong, too, and would try to do her best in school. She would adapt just like the winter hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
3114	4	It shows the importance of the  Hibiscus to Saeng and her dedication to the flower. It is also stating that she will wait for next spring to admire the flower again.	0	0		0																					
3122	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she saying when everything gets back to normal that�s when she is going to take the test again. Second, because there would be nothing else to say if it is not back to the way she wanted it to be. For instance, if you were building an house and a blizzared came, you would stop, you said that you would not continue until there was nice weather again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.	1	1		1																					
3147	4	This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the atire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flower and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that save her the courage she needed to retake her driver�s test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, �when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...� At first the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story.	0	0		0																					
3150	4	The author concludes the story with that like, to leave the reader guessing. The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve. The author was trying to show how she can change, and grow just like her plant.	2	2		2																					
3151	4	The author used the concludes with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She wrights that because when her flower starts budding she will be able to take the test cause she is like a flower. The author uses the concludes because when the flower is going to budd and the geese come back she will think that she is back home. Thats why I think the author used the conclusion �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.	1	1		1																					
3157	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� probably chose to end the story that way because then it�s ending with a sense of hope. Also, it is showing how Saeng is adapting to her surroundings much like the winter hibiscus. In the second last paragraph, Saeng hears the hanks of the geese and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her through the course of the time Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because the time would allow her to grow and adapt even more. The hibiscus will be budding then, a sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adopting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could look to the plant for inspiration. This feeling of hope in Saeng and her future is left in the last paragraph, which is why the story ends there.	2	3		3																					
3158	4	The author concludes this paragraph to the story because, seasons change, plant don�t most likely grow during winter time. So you learn a lesson and take it as it is and a wait until the next time you learn basically the same lesson, when the right time comes.	1	1		1																					
3159	4	I think that in the story �Winter Hibiscus� was a good story and also the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was like to work hard and that is why it mentions at the way end �I will take the test again� so you don�t fall and stay down you work hard and get back up and try again.	1	1		1																					
3166	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng is saying she is learning to adapt to this country. Earlier in the story she says that she failed the test, because she did not impress her mom. Saeng and her mom are used to ife in Vietnam, they trying to adapt. Saeng thought that the hibiscus she got Is just like the one she had at home. At the end she realizes if she just has faith everything will be @CAPS1 and it will be just like home. She says in the spring because by then her hibiscus will be fully growned and she will take the test again to see if the hibiscus is like the one her mother thought she would get. Saeng is learning to adapt to her new country of the United States.	2	2		2																					
3172	4	The authoR ends the STORY this way because their trying To show that Saeng will be dedicated To the hibiscus gardening and once she proves herself she will have passed the test. It also shows that she wants her heritage to be a major part of her life by growing their nations flower 	0	0		0																					
3173	4	"The author ends the story with this quote, because it shows how determined Saeng is to passing her driving test. For example, in the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", Saeng after she fails her driving test says something to forget about fating, and she said, �Let�s plant, right now�, she said this because she was trying to forget about her failing, and focus in something positive, In conclusion, this is why the author ends with this quote, and an example of how determined and focus Saeng is to passing her driving test.

She walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home. She buys it and takes it home in a pot. She says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant. Her mother then comes and shares the moment with her. Saeng feels better now. In the end sentence the author includes �saeng vowed silently to her herself, in the spring when the snows melt� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�(Ho, ??)  the flower has given her the conbidence to socceed and she wants to take the test again. This shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain.	2	2		2																					
3184	4	"In the Story the @CAPS1 concluds the story with the sentance ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think he ends it this way because she has accepted that she failed or lost but is willing to try again to accomplish her goal and ""take that test again"". Also she is making a promise, or a vow to her self and to not give up on her goal."	2	1		2																					
3185	4	The author concludes the story with he paragraph because they both go togather the away there both about things going and leaving the season changing. like they don�t won�t to let go but they knew there be back soon. Thats why the author combided the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3188	4	She is  saying that ryt now, is not the right time to table the tst, she is saying that she is going to wait to care back until spring, when the flowrs we blooming to take the test, @CAPS1 she is so acentric abought the exotic flowers, She can�t stand to do it now, when the time isn�t right. So she is saying that she is going to wait until the time is right to take the test.	0	0		0

So, saeng declared that next year, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding , she shall take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3193	4	"The reason why the author concludes this paragraph is to show saeng that she will be waiting for them to grow back and she will try again for her test. Hibiscus means a lot to her, and will keep trying because she doesnt want her mother disappointed in her again. Example of wher saeng felt shame ""her mother stared at her incredulously. But how could you?"" saeng wants to not down herself or her mother. ""saeng vowed silently to herself"" saying a promise that she will pass and respect nature as well as elders"	1	1		1																					
3194	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� by minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is buddling , then I will take the test again,� @CAPS1 author concludes the story in this way because it is somewhat of a cliffhanger. In the story, @CAPS2 is upset about failing her driving test and she has just moved from Vietnam to the united states and so she is a little homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up ??? reminding being alike the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng hasn�t given up and that she is going  to try and pass the drivers license test again. But what you don�t know is the end result of whether she passes or not and so it is a cliffhaofer. That is why the author ended the story in this way.	2	2		2																					
3198	4	I think that the author concludes the story she fails the driving test, so they added she was going to take it over. And maybe the plant is or would be good luck to her after the snow melts and the geese return it would be a fresh Start. Also it would be nice after she descovered the plant.	1	1		1																					
3203	4	In the same way the hibiscus flower prevails in the winter saeng wants to be the same way. Saeng failed a test which makes her feel unsuccessful. Saeng wants to prevail she wants to stick it out and the rough times she�s going through make it very difficult for her. When Saeng says �I � I failed the test� this shows that saeng feels disappointe that she didn�t  expect that because she is a fighter, So the author ends the passage with saeng saying� When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� To show how much of a fighter Saeng is because she�s determined to strive under difficult conditions.	2	2		2																					
3204	4	The author puts this paragraph last because it shows that saeng is looking to a new lease almost on life. She now has something to take her through the year that is ahead of her she now wait till it is winter once again to see the hibiscus flower bloom once again and as wel as many more to come	1	1		1																					
3205	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I believe she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, someday being symbolized by when the geese come back. Saeng is sad because she missis her homeland and she sees plants that bringback memories, so she buys a winter hibiscus to ease & comfort her & remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
3210	4	In the story,  @ORGANIZATION1, by  Minfong   Ho, a  girl  named  Saeng  tries  to  adjust  to  a  new country, but it is nearly impossible. She is stressed about failing the driver�s test, country, but it is and she realizes that  nothing is  the same. Except for  one thing  that  she  quickly  recognized. A  plant called the �Winter Hibiscus.�It made her think of her old life in Vietnam. It helped her  set  through  hard  times  and she didn�t want to give up on anythings.This is exactly why Minfong Ho ends the  last paragraph  by stating  that Saeng  will retry  the driving test when the hibiscus is budding.The  flower gives her a thought of home   in  Vietnam, making her try and try again.Also,the author  ends the  story  like   this  to  state a  theme. This particular  theme  is,  �No matter  how hard something  might  be, you can get through it. You  just  have  to  find  a way that benefits you most.�	2	2		2																					
3215	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by @CAPS1 Ho. The author is stating that Saeng is happy when she is around the plant and she finds peace with the plant because it brings back childhood memories. For example �And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton.� She loved the way it made her feel. When one of the leaves fell off and she breathed in, it remined her of grandmother. @CAPS1 might of experienced something like this. @CAPS1 might of wrote this because the story could relate to other people who moved from another country and have something that brought back memories. Everytime that l touch or smell a sweater,it brings back memorises of my grandmother. I feel that he wrote this because of his personal experience and it could relate to others	1	2		2																					
3217	4	The author concludes this story by saying this statement because the author want you to feel like the character in the book is determined. The ator is trying to put across a statement saying  get through then try again. The character is not giving up, and she will get through the test eve though its hard.	1	1		1																					
3218	4	The author is talking about gardning and how she wants to get better at in the spring. She probably thinks shes bad at gardening because her mom is really good at it and she wants to be that good at gardening too.	0	0		0																					
3221	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he basicly trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might mean through seasons. She @MONTH1 think that she would have better on her test in the spring only for the simply fact that everything blooms in the spring.	1	1		1																					
3226	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" at the end of the story the author writes ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again."" The reason why the author said that Is because she Is trying to tell the readers to get right back up and do it again, If you fell once there Is no harm and trying again. When its spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promise to take the drive's test. After failing a driver test Saeng buys a flower at a florIst that remInded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and put it in the garden. Told her mother that she fail, Saeng's mother was very understand and told her maybe next time In conclusion the author �write the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life.  "	1	2		2																					
3233	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted to get her point across. also because she wanted to create an under standing of the complexitier of the passage. The author wanted the reader to feel her message as if they were there to witness it.	0	0		0																					
3244	4	The author concude the story with that paragraph because its what she solemely promoted herself.	0	0		0																					
3247	4	The author concludes the story with this @CAPS1 the author wants to show Saeng hasn�t given up. Easly in the story Saeng goes to the green house and starts to cry. When she gets home she says to her mother, �I-I failed the test.� @CAPS1 of this Saeng wanted to go back and try again. That is why the author ended with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3257	4	I think the author concludes the story with the phase �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� I there saying that they will be ready for them the next time they come back.	0	0		0																					
3259	4	The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a little. For example when Saeng said that she ment when the plants came back. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on two, rather than staping on talking about the v or geese to get the reader off topic. Last she also ment when the geese came back.	0	0		0																					
3260	4	I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see�s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack.	1	1		1																					
3266	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again to emphasize that you can overcome a defeat or failure by waiting until the ""season"" come again for you to re-endure. Basically, the hibiscus(a plant) meant much to the narrator and her mother which was dying and they dug up a hole to help it to grow, so when it grows again that proves that it will be living better. So when Saeng relates the test that will be her her having the opportunity to past the test. The story with this paragraph symbolizing a new beginning about to take place. This actually means a situation that will came again that will help you to get what is needed out of it that you missed. The story and the paragraph emphasizes what life is about to budling a cycle."	3	2		3																					
3281	4	"The author concludes as the story with the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself., in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" mean that she will take the test and hoped she pass so she could make her mother happy and support her. She chosee spring because spling is the rebirth of nature and Saeng would like to retake the test with a clear and clean mind. I think that the reason why the author choose to put the paragraph in the end of the story. "	1	1		1																					
3283	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver�s test. �She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. �This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she�ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2.	2	2		2																					
3284	4	The author concluded this story with the paragraph because, Saeng is explaing to the reader�s that she will take the test again when the time is right. When things seem to be getting better she will retake the test. That is why the authour used that paragraph to conclude her story.	1	1		1																					
3288	4	"In the story ""WiNter Hibiscus"" by MiNFOnG HO the author concludes the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the sprinG, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddiNG, then I will take that test again"". The author concluded the story with that @CAPS1 because she is sayinG that when the year starts OFF @CAPS2 and starts over, that she will too. She's sayinG that when the Geese @CAPS3 back, the snow melts, and the Hibiscus starts to bud that they all start over and start a @CAPS2 beGiNNiNG. So when she Goes to take the test it will be a @CAPS2 year."	1	2		2																					
3292	4	"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says �When they come back� she is talking about the flowers. When the come back alive. �In the spring� shows when the flower will come back. �When the snows melt and the geese return� she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring). �And this Hibiscus is budding� She is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring. � Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!"	1	2		2																					
3295	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of reasons.	0	0		0																					
3303	4	Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these tequniques a story @MONTH1 seem bland average or unattractive. Author Minfong Ho canverys the fact that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of simply stating the fact that she will retake the test, he has her make a promise on the geese that she will. The Author ended the story like this show how strongly she felt about the test.	0	0		0																					
3323	4	"I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perserverance. Saeng states, �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, �when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the season's bring things back, she will come back. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should perservere because things just take time."	2	1		2																					
3326	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver�s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
3330	4	He concludes the story like thot because the test was the main thing thot he was talking about.	0	0		0																					
3332	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown. She has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too. nature�s fight for survival is like Saeng�s struggle in a new place. She discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time. Then after that time it will feel just like home. The adaption principle is shown throughout this story demonstrate by nature or a child�s life it�s there. Therefore the author would agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng.	3	2		3																					
3336	4	I think the author puts that paragraph in the story because maybe because its a good luck thing or its a tradition so its very important that its in the story. Also it could be trying to tell us something like she only take test in the spring when the hibiscus starts budding.	0	0		0																					
3342	4	The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng�s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn�t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did.	1	2		2																					
3344	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story was leading to it and the story  would have been pointless if it wasnt conclusion.	0	0		0																					
3350	4	In the story winter Hibiscus they end the story with that paragaph, because it repents that she is geting use to the new contrury. She is also telling you that you need to a paped to newsra winds. That�s why I think they ened with that pargraph	1	1		1																					
3351	4	The flowers on this bush are very comforting to Saeng. In the story she explains that they remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of plant and spring represent new life. Saeng thinks that spring could also have a new beginning for her. That in spring, she will do better and pass the test. But, if she falls again, the flowers will have bloomed to comfort her.	2	2		2																					
3360	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the authore is trying to show the reader that she realized cares about the nature and loves It so because she is waiting for the spring and as soon as the spring comes she will take the test again. So in my opinion the author wants to show the readers that the character in story cares a lot about the natures baety.	1	1		1																					
3365	4	The author ended the story that way to show that Saeng won�t give up and is determined to complete her task. The author wants the reader to understand Saeng�s very sad and wants to overcome being homesick. Saeng is very much like the hibiscus plant, she�s frail and beautiful. Saeng says she will do her test again when the hibiscus is budding, almost like she�s growing along with the plant. 	2	1		2																					
3366	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that everything and everyone can make it through a tough time. This paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers. The text say, �when they come back... I will take that test again�. This quote shows that Saeng can see herself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She knows that her �winter� is her test and that when she is ready, she�ll be able to take the test again and be successful. The budding of the hibiscus represents the time when she�ll be prepared to take the test. Though she is having a tough tine now, she'll be able to get through it and make another attempt. This paragraph is at the end because it brings together the purpose of the hibiscus. Without saying this, the readers would have never gotten this message, instead, they would believe that the role of the hibiscus was to serve as a connection to Saeng�s past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph was included to show readers that everyone can balance back from a bad situation.	3	3		3																					
3367	4	One it could mean she can only take the test in the spring. But also because her surroundings during that period relaxed heR. When she was dissapointed and @CAPS1 about her driving failing grade.	1	1		1																					
3379	4	The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason @MONTH1 be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. �Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too but they come back every year. Along with the flower Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do. She won�t give up but try again later on in the year. This shows how she is adapting and changing to work with her new surrondings.	3	2		3																					
3380	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng�s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says �vowed� to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� familiar.� The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time.	2	2		2																					
3382	4	The author had the story end with the paragraph because all the ideas are brought together and to show that Saeng is ready for whats ahead. When they put in the flower they are concluding the flowers importance and how it relates to how the girl feels being happy or sad. Yet when she says that she vowed... and shed take the test again she saying that she is ready for whats ahead but will be open minded to whats new so that she can see were she�s gone from. Therefore the author ends with that paragraph to leave mystry for what happend and to conclude.	2	2		2																					
3383	4	The author concludes the story with this because its winter now + the flowers are gone, but during that time when she was planting she grew more mature. like it says in the text things she used to think were strange are now becoming firmiliar + shes getting the hang of things. Because shes learning more about it + will be ready for the test next spring. 	1	2		2																					
3384	4	The author uses this as an ending paragraph in the story because the next year at the same time she will take the test of life over again.	0	0		0																					
3392	4	I think he put this in here because. I think he�s trying to say when the snow melts just forget bout the first time. And when the geese return it your @NUM1 chance. Then the hibiscus budding is you get passed what you were trying to do.	1	1		1																					
3393	4	This author concludes the story with this paragraph, because they both where talking about the cold or the weather and the @CAPS1 so it sated when snows melt as it talkes about weather or the @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
3395	4	"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to illustrate the oevrall message of the story. That paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles. Saeng is coming from another country and is facing challenges not only in the garden, but in her life as well. She had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, by saying ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� she truly shows her determination and how shes not afraid to overcome obstacles that will face her. "	2	2		2																					
3398	4	There are two reasons why he had conclude the story with this pararagraph. The one reason why the author had conclude the story with the paragraph because Saeng had silently had picked up a Winter Hibiscus so she can have to passed that driving Test. Finally; the last reason why the author had conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to try her driving Test again so she can passed so she can also drive when she gets down passing it. These two reasons were so confusing to figure out what the author conclude in the story with that sentence.	1	1		1																					
3406	4	To me I would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons. To explain it could mean new begining or starting over. For example, when the geese fly away and came back, that means that the @CAPS1 are changeing. So with that being said, the @CAPS1 changing or starting over could represent his chance to take test can start over, and he will get another chance.  	2	1		2																					
3407	4	I think they think it will bring them luck	1	1		1																					
3415	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and next time that time of year comes back around she will have another chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didn�t even cost that much. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3417	4	The author included this because she was showing that it was winter and the flower was goin to bloom and the geese were flying here because it is cold. Also the author said that because the story title is called the �Winter Hibiscus� which obviously blooms in the winter so that is why I think the author said what she did.	0	0		0																					
3423	4	There are many reasons the author says �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again .� @CAPS1 the author said this because the girl left everything just to come to this country and she can not fail. The gil said  �That at last , she could hold on to. But where was the fine-foothed come? the hibiscus hedge? She also said this because the hedge was all she had from her old home besides her mother and when the �hibiscus is budding� means its starting a new life and is starting to grow leafs and the girl is starting grow and move on with her life. 	2	2		2																					
3427	4	The author concludes her story with the quote, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� because the author  is showing that nature and the plant are valuable to her. Saeng (who says the quote) believes that the hibiscus will help her pass the test. Earlier on in the story it shows that when she gets in trouble, she rubs the plant leaves in her hands to help her overcome the problem. The author is making the idea clear and portraying the idea that the plant helps Saeng with obstacles.	1	2		2																					
3428	4	In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year.One reason she @MONTH1 have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test. Also the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam it gave her the confidense to go out and get what she wanted.	1	2		2																					
3432	4	In my opinion the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was feeling down about not passing her driving test but when she saw those flowers she realize when she came to @CAPS1 she  forget all about her home town. So she decied to get back in touch with a nature side and hold off taking her test intill the spring instead of rushing things.	1	1		1																					
3436	4	The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next @DATE1. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3445	4	The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the �Madagascar periwinkle� growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.  	1	1		1																					
3448	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they com back, saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 then she will become more familiar. For example, the author says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become , through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her now.� That tells me that she feels that over same time , she will become more familiar with driving and then she will take the test again. Then she @MONTH1 pass it	1	1		1																					
3449	4	 The author of �Winter Hibiscus� decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to @LOCATION1 and has had a rough time fitting in. She misses everything about her old home, from her grandmother to the old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels that all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the winter and bloom in the spring and that is what Saeng realizes she must do. The last paragraph said �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Spring is the time for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers start to bloom, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes she wants a new beginning as well to be brought I the spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph ties the theme of new beginnings into the story. It shows @CAPS1 new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it. 	3	2		3																					
3451	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. First, when the hibiscus buds in the spring that means that the plant is about to bloom. That also means that Saeng will be ready in the spring to take the test again. Also the last paragraph is at the end because if the plant can make it, then the girl can pass her drivers test and be happy both ways.	1	1		1																					
3457	4	The author concluded this story for a internal adjust. Saeng's memories are expressed through the one at the hibiscus. The spring is a season where everything is fresh and new. As by spring, Saeng's hope would be restored and thriving, when the budding hibiscus, and the will have the ability to try at the test again with more strength and inspiration. 	2	2		2																					
3458	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. 	3	3		3																					
3463	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is willing to give the test another try. She is now more open �minded about the situation. In the beginning of the story, Saeng was upset and annoyed about failing her driver�s test. For example, �the tearstains on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I-I failed the test,� Saeng said to her mother. Obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself. The author didn�t want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending. Saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. For example, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� I believe that this attitude was because of the memorys of her mother country that soothes her and also her mother. In conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal.	2	3		3																					
3465	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because when the snow melts and the geese return, she going to have higher confidence in taking and passing the test. After she failed the test later on in the story the geeses had flew away. So when the geese return the geese will remind her of what had just now happened. When the snow melts and spring comes the hibiscus flower will bloom once again.	1	1		1																					
3467	4	"Coming back from failing her driving test, Saeng is comforted by finding the hibiscus flower. It brings back cherished @CAPS1 about Saeng's homeland, because it is very similar to flowers that grew by her old home. The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. In Saeng's mind , if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she."	2	2		2																					
3468	4	The story of �Winter Hibiscus� is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. Saeng misses her homeland but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, and pass her drivers test. The story is nicely concluded with Saeng's promise to herself that come spring, she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleinates some home-sickness. Saeng�s promise indicates that she is comng to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons. �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become.. - Almost familiar to her now.� I feel that was a landmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that by allows to change.	3	3		3																					
3471	4	The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well.	0	0		0																					
3473	4	The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects.	1	2		2																					
3474	4	I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize�s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her.	2	1		2																					
3477	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� Saeng decides to retake failed driver�s test in the spring. She does so because she is comforted on the moderate weather of the spring. It reminds her of home, and Saeng is very closely attached to home. It reminds me of all the places I�ve been and how I still remember my favorite one. Like Saeng, I buy objects that remind me of my old home Saeng�s commitment to her old home makes me feel less different when I miss my old home.	1	1		1																					
3482	4	The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, �I just stared at the hibiscus,� this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready.	1	2		2																					
3489	4	She realized that things come and go but also change. That content times of the year the world around her changed. She had no control over it. She also had to deal with living in a new country. Living in anew country was hard for Saeng. She had to eat new foods, hear new sonds, and see thing that she never had seen before. Failing her drives test was hard for her. Not knowing the launge and what going on around her was tough of on her. the world around her wasnt something she was us to. She knew she had to change herself and work harder to get what she wanted.	2	2		2																					
3492	4	"To me it seam like the whoever was saying that must of been going through a lot of things and that they was feeling like they were being tested or something or maybe somebody left her that she really loved because it say �when they come back"" so @CAPS1 thinking somebody @MONTH1 have left or something."" And the reason I said that the person @MONTH1 have feel as if they were being tested because it says �I will take the test again.�"	0	0		0																					
3494	4	The author uses this conclusion for a reason. The reason the author uses this cliff-hanges of a conclusion is to keep the reader interested and wanting more. By saying,�I will take that test again,� the author makes the reader question if Saeng will pass the test next time and the reader will wonder what �the test� is.	1	1		1																					
3498	5	"Throughout the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, manages to maintain a single overall mood. In many parts of the story he tells about how much he loved his childhood so it lead me to think was nostalgia, but nowhere does it emphasize that he yearns to return to past times. He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became"" family"" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states how his parents were so brave to leave their lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times on how his parents helped so many in need. If in Rodriguez's position I would love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and upbringing of their son."	2	2		2																					
3499	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir is love. the author finds out that family doesn't have to be blood related.

3508	5	The mood of the memoir is very upbeat, happy mood of how @PERSON1. Grew up in Newark, New Jersey in a very Cuban family and tells the story of how Narciso went through his childhood. This memoir really emphasizes the connection and love that Narciso had with his parents and his home. It kind of makes you think that there is more to a house than just walls and a ceiling and that maybe it's part of a family.	1	1		1																					
3511	5	 The mood created by the author in this memoir was very loving and caring for their friends, family and everyone around them, for example it says how his mom would always keep the door open for whoever was going through a rough time or untill they were back on their feet because she knew they would do the same for her and her family. Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life. The mood also shows how that somthing small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in.	2	2		2																					
3518	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez was happy and thankful. His parents taught him many things about their cuban back ground, like cooking and music.

His parents turned their house into a home for other People as well. ""My parents always kept their Arms and door open to the many people we considered family."" Narciso's parents would take in anybody that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Narciso's parents were very loving to the community and help out as much as the could in making that place at home."	2	2		2																					
3519	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a serious, happy and thankful mood. The author was serious to the point where his family had to go through economic and personal problems. However, the author was happy how they lived in a friendly and unified neighborhood with other immigrant from different countrys. The author showed thankfulness because his parents worked so hard to give him a new life. The memoir showed a good mood as well as a accurate portrait of the athour childhood.	2	2		2																					
3523	5	The author could have put alot of different types of mood in the memoir. I think that the mood of the memoir is happy, greatful and appreciated. I said happy because he talks about every thing he does and how he enjoys it I said greate because he is always thanking his parents and he admires them. He admires them because thy have comed last to the good life and they do everything in their power to have a good life. An he appreciates him because of the same thing I said before he admires them and always thank them for what they have done to her. This is the mood the authors has toward writting the story.	2	2		2																					
3524	5	"In Narciso's memoir, I feel joy. I feel joy because Narciso's parents were able to survive. They came to @LOCATION1, ""without any knowledge of the language or culture."" @CAPS1 immigrant families do not get on there feet right away and they did, within a year they went from a @NUM1 room apartment to a @NUM2 room appartment.Joy came to my mind also because they had welcoming arms to there family. People today are losing there jobs & homes and they have nobody to go to, but the Rodriguez family had a place to go. ""Countless extaded family members came & went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms & their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."""	3	2		3																					
3527	5	"The authors mood in the memoir @PERSON1 is thankful. I know this, because in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 talks about his culinary skills and how grateful he is to have it passed down to him. This shows us that he is very much thankful for this skill, because some people don't know how to cook and to be able to cook is a blessing. This also shows us that he is proud of his culture and who he is as a person. @PERSON2 quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" In @CAPS2, this shows us that @PERSON2 was very much appreciative of all that his parents had done for him. Also that he loved his parents dearly and every chance he gets, he thanks them. Therefore in the memoir Narciso gives off the mood of being thankful."	3	2		3																					
3531	5	The mood in this story was security and happiness. Security was prevailed when all different people with different culture and heritage could live together without fights or arguments at a time when there was a lot of racial tension in @LOCATION1. Happiness was showed in many different ways. One way was when he was describing the warmth, music and cooking in his house. Also, when he was talking about how thankful he was for what his parents sacrificed for him. Overall, @PERSON1 was happy about how his whole childhood when and it seemed like he loved every last minute of it.	2	3		3																					
3532	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. He seems happy because, he talks about his parents, his family, and his home which make him happy. In paragraph @NUM1, the author talks about how being blood-related doesn't have to do with family. In paragraph  two, the author talks about the simple house that his parents made a home. When you read paragraph  two, and how he describes the home, the author makes you feel happy. In paragraph @NUM2, the author says how he will always be grateful for his parents and the life that they gave him. That is the mood and some examples created by the author in the memoir.	3	3		3																					
3535	5	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" is a Open happy familly because her parents worked and made a wonderful home for her. I think the mood in the story is a open happy family becase in the text it says ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood related"" and that @CAPS3 that when @CAPS2 was growing up her family had a bunch of people that were considered family but not blood related. Also the text said ""It was a close knit community of honest, hardworking imigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" That just @CAPS3 that her parants let anyone from their community who needed a family become part of their familly, or anybody who was lonley just have some company from them."	2	3		3																					
3536	5	The mood the author creates in this memoir is a feeling of relationships and love between so called 'extended family'. The author emphasizes the relationship between Narciso Rodriguez's family and the surrounding neihbors is so close that they could be family. The author incorporates the feeling of overall joy and happiness this boy has, even though they have a small house, they could still turn it into a loving home. The author shows how much this boy loves the heritage he has and his fun parents who taught him to love cooking and cuban music. This memoir shows how he is poor, but still can have a fun and interesting life with lots of friends and fond memories. Narciso is very thankful for his parents and this shows how appreciative he is of the simplist things iand home. The overall mood in this memoir would have to be thankfulness. The characters are so thankfull for everything they have.	2	3		3																					
3538	5	"The mood created in the memoir is grateful. ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwrittingly Passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today"". What I mean by that is that he is grateful for what he learned from is parents. ""I would always be grateful to my Parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the besis of my life. What I mean about that is that he loves and cherish his mom and dad for what they did for him.

3540	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because Narciso is happy for everything that has happened Narciso is happy for his family and his native haratige. For example in the beginning of the story is says Narciso loves he haratige and his family. This means he's happy.	2	2		2																					
3543	5	The mood created by the author was happiness. Because every one came together as a family and they look out for each other when they were in need. They also helped each other out and were kind and friendly.	1	1		1																					
3544	5	"The mood in this memoir is heartwarming.This memoir is heartwarming because it's about her parents came from Cuba to the @CAPS1. S. It's nice how the blonde-brick house was better but still the same as the house their parents lived in. The Cuban music filled the air of the house like it was a house in Cuba. A house isn't a house untill you call it a home. That family has made that their home forever. Even though their family can't come down till 1970 they too will have a place to call home like Narciso Rodriguez did. Like he said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home""."	2	3		3																					
3549	5	The mood the author created in the memoir is a roller coaster. It goes up and down. At the beginning of this story, it was quit deppressing. It's basically just Rodriguez describing the crummy quarters he lived in. But, as the story progresses, it is filled with happiness and even though living conditions werent all that great, he still had fun. In the end, home is about relationships rather than physical space.	2	1		2																					
3550	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is caring because his mother gave people a home to help them get back on their feet and kept her arms open and door open.

His parents gave him these qualities which he adores but he is ""eternally grateful for his rich culinary skills that were passed on to him by his parents. @PERSON1 also talked about the role of ""family"" in the environment in which he grew up in. In his neighborhood, many people were the victims of racism, so they all came together to be a stronger whole. By growing up like this he learned how to give a helping hand to those who were in need. @PERSON1 also told the reader of the courage his parents had by leaving everything they knew and loved behind and how he wished he could have that same courage, but at least he knew of it."	3	3		3																					
3571	5	The move the author created in the memoir was that he made it so theres still hope. Even if your an immigrant you can still make it to the top. @PERSON1 family moved from Cuba when racism was legal. The neighborhood was a family, or unity. Now Narciso is a famous fashion designer. Coming from Cuba with nothing starting a new life entirely over was very hard	0	2		1																					
3576	5	"In this memoir gives a grateful feeling. Some of the reasons I think this is because like in paragraph @NUM1. The author says ""�our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuba, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevail in the United States."" But the main part of the story is that how he loves the neighborhood he lives in and the house he lives in and mostly how much the people are basically family in that neighborhood. And that is why I think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir."	2	2		2																					
3584	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created by the author. The mood is happiness and joyfulness because in this memoir the author continues to talk on about his family a culture which is a perfect reason for the mood to be happy. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" this quot was found in @CAPS1 @NUM1, this quot also shows that his family was kind and generous. This mood involved the familys culture which Narciso loved so much. His beautiful culture was just another piece of the puzzel that fit together, and that last quot ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home"" found in @CAPS1 @NUM2 really puts every thing together touching the reader emotionally."	2	2		2																					
3589	5	Narciso Rodriguez, a memoir about growing up in a new environment with his family, Narciso puts a definite mood in the memoir. The mood, to put it in general terms, is happy.

In paragraph two, the author explains how his parents brought their Cuban heritage into their home like food, music, family gatherings, and fun celebrations. All of that set a very happy backdrop for the family. In paragraph four, Narciso shows that there was always people over and having a fun time.

3590	5	"Home and family is the @CAPS1 one thing all of us love.

3591	5	"The author created a mood in the memoir. The author creates the mood of friendliness. I know this because in the text it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solodalriy and friendship."" This means that even though there was segregation around them, their neighborhood was still friendly. All and all, the author created a mood in the memoir."	2	1		2																					
3592	5	"The mood created in this memoir is excilent. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This gives me the feeling of thankfulness and to really admire what my parents have done for me. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""It was here I learned the real definition of family."" This quote makes me feel so happy that I have a family that supports me and is always there for me. This memoir really changed how I look at things and made me relize how thankful I am to have my family."	2	3		3																					
3593	5	The mood changed throughout the memoir. First the mood started off depressing by saying in Cuba they had a one room furnished apartment. That when they came to @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment. Next mood was inspirring. It was inspirring because the parents were a poor family and they found a way to move out of cuba. Also because his parents were selflessly getting out of cuba so there children could have a better place to live. Lastly there was a mood of family. They were honest hardworking immagrants who extended a hand to help people in need. Also they were always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogated grandparents Sergio and @CAPS1 there too.

Most important his so greatful to his parents for everything they've been through to see him sucuss in life and that's what I admire the most from the author. This story is giving thanks to his parents and his culture. He mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story. Like at the end when he says ""I learned the definition of ""family"", meaning his family was there for each other and and love was all over. This pasage made me realize everything my mother went through to see my brother and I success, so I can say I can relate to the auther."	3	2		3																					
3613	5	This memoir had one theme that meant many different things. One theme was helpful. The family moved to the @LOCATION1 from Cuba in 1956 and had many hard ships and struggles. Because they know what it feels like they decisded to help the other struggling people, and let them stay with them; that's exactly what they did. Another theme that I thought fit was inspiration. I think this family not only inspiried their children but other neighbors and other reletives. Last, I think another theme of this excerpt was heart � felt. The @CAPS1 � @CAPS2 family risked everything to help other families. That's was a very nice action they took on them. One person can slowly make a difference, person by person; that is exactly what this family did.	1	3		2																					
3617	5	Happy. You should always be proud where you came from. Not only that back your background like your culture and your parents. Stuff like that. Never be ashamed about stuff like that even if your diffrent it shouldn't matter. The more diffrent you're the more unique you're.  Just look at it that way. Plus you should never change just because of what you're and what you look like. 	1	0		1

3627	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood, that is overall cheerful, warm, and happy. He does this through his word choice. ""passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cookig that is still with me today."" (par @NUM1). He decribes his parents cooking skills as ""rich"" and he describes his feelings toward cooking as positive. Another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people. ""all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (par @NUM2). From this quote, you can tell that he has a very close relationship with all the people. Another example is when he says, ""always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love."" (par. @NUM3). You can feel the warmth of the room with the adjectives he uses. This is how the author creates the mood in the story."	2	4		2																					
3642	5	"The mood is happy, proud, and grateful. Happy because he loved his family, his culture, and his home. ""In our neighborhood, dispite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.

""my parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" The mood being created is detirmenation. The parents were determined to make it to the United States because that was hard to do. But the parents did make it to the United States. The other piece of evidence found is ""in 1961, I was born into the simple house, situated in a two-family, blonde-brick building in the @CAPS1 bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" The mood being created is happiness and sadness. There is happiness because he was just born. The sadness is that they couldn't go to the hospital and they live in a two-family house. This is the moods created in the memior."	2	2		2																					
3650	5	"The mood in this memoir was soft, with an exception. I say that the mood is soft because it has a nice thankful mood that's really telling everyone how grateful he is of his parents and their care. It's also saying that there was racism and segragation, so in that paragraph (which is the exception) the mood is more of a rougher mood, I say rougher as in ""a rough life,"" having to deal with racism and segragation. Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend and her putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly, this reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the camunity helps out by sometines cooking neals. This was nice of Alegria (@ORGANIZATION1's friend). And also, how they would house family until they were back on their feet and having the feeling that their familly would do the same. for them. And lastly, the last sentence of the last paragraph gave the sense of them took a house and turned it into a home would be comforting. These all gives off the soft sense, meaning nice and thankful"	3	2		3

3663	5	"The mood in the memoir is gratefullness, happyness and remembrance.                                                                  Narciso is pround and thankfull of his parents, of them coming all this way by themselves and having to start their whole lives over ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" They came to @LOCATION1 ""to give their children a better life."" They struggled, taking any job that they could find, They struggled for him, so he didn't have to struggle. Narcisco admires them for ""their strength and perseverance."" Narciso sets the mood in the memoir as gratefulness to his parents and for all that they have done for him.                      He is happy with the life they have created for him, and is happy that they have done so well ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.                                                                                                       Narciso is happy and grateful for his life that he was given by his parents."	2	3		3																					
3666	5	"The mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The author creates gratefulness by repeatedly saying what his parents gave him and that he is grateful for it. First he talks about how he is grateful his parents got him interested in cooking. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their... love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author is grateful for his parents showing him to love cooking. Another time the author is grateful is in paragraph @NUM2. It says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the author is grateful for his parents' endurance to come to @LOCATION1. In conclusion, the mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. He was grateful for his parents giving him all they could."	3	2		3																					
3668	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy. It made me feel happy because it was good to know that ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This meant that all the people around you that care about you are your ""family"". Another reason why the mood of the memoir is happy is because I think if my parents were in the same situation that Narciso's parents were in, my parents would have done the same thing. My parents would have also wanted, ""to give their children a better life."" @CAPS1 this memoir makes me feel happy because of how caring Narciso's parent's were."	2	2		2																					
3675	5	"In this memoir, there is more than one mood. There is love, friendship, and happiness Narciso expresses love for her parents and friends in paragraph @NUM1. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author is saying that everyone comes toge-ther and that they all care for eachother. She expresses friendship in parag-raph @NUM2. When she says that her babysitter was her first friend. Finally, she expresses happiness. In paragraph @NUM3, when she is saying ""she will never forget how her parents turned this simple house into a home. You could tell that she is happy, and grateful for her parents. Those are a @CAPS1 moods in the memoir."	2	3		3																					
3680	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is intresting. First of all, his parents ""originally from cuba but arrived in the united states in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one room apartment, twenty one years old Rawedia Maria and twenty seven year old @ORGANIZATION1 could afford to move into a modest three room apartment I would soon call home. ""in 1961, I was born into this simple house situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Thats how the mood is intresting from the author creation"	1	0		1																					
3684	5	The mood created by the @CAPS1 is happy because he talking about starting a new life and how grateful family he has. The way he is also happy is that he has his 'family such as cousin, aunts, uncles, and grandparents by his side. Where he live is also happy he loves it he has his friends and babysitter living above him knowing that they are their for him. That why I think the mood is happy by telling by the story and @CAPS2 words.	1	1		1																					
3687	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author is happy. The author describes his home is a place for family. He is grateful to his parents for everything they did. The author enjoyed his childhood. He was surrounded by loving people and lots of friends. That is how in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author is happy."	1	1		1																					
3689	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is deffinitty being proud. The reason I think the author is proud is because he explains how he grew up throughout his whole life. Also, growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot, to being a famous fashion designer. Lastly, this memior's mood also seems proud because he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1, the author makes him seem proud of himself."	2	1		2																					
3697	5	"In the memoir the mood that the author created is the memoir can be @CAPS1 in two ways. first was happy for being created and being able to use america's beautifulfriendlyness. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to a blood relative."" @CAPS2 was that knowing that if you have hope anything can be achived. ""I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	2	2		2																					
3702	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @PERSON1 says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir."	2	3		3																					
3705	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 created a certain mood. Narciso Rodriguez created a gentle mood that stayed constant. @CAPS1 tells how his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family."" Which means @CAPS1 probably grew up in a life without very much violence. @CAPS1 also says that @CAPS1 ""will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 wants his parents to know that @CAPS1 loves them very much and lets them know by thinking them. Lastly @CAPS1 @CAPS1 says @CAPS1 ""will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The sense of gentleness stays throughout the whole memoir because @CAPS1 is always saying the good things about his life, not the bad."	2	2		2																					
3709	5	The author was @CAPS2 likely describing his happy @CAPS1. Because in the memair it was talking about how he loved his home and his parents Cooking and music. He was @CAPS2 grateful for his parents caring and selflessness. He liked how his home was a community for Spanish, cuban, and italian immagrants. He thought back to his memorable birthdays and feasts and it made him happy. This is my summary of Narciso Rodriguez's mood of the story.	2	2		2																					
3711	5	"The mood described by the author in the memoir is a greatful and happy feeling I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, Always brings up how he is greatful for his partents helping him in his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story states, ""At tine when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great soidarity and friendship."" Even though there is racism, @CAPS1 one is friends."	2	2		2																					
3718	5	"The mood of the author in the memoir is very happy. I think it sounds like the child of the greatful family is talking and she is one of the most greatful people I ever read about because she says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house to a home""."	1	1		1																					
3719	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a truely original mood in the excerpt. I would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. He is consteintly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. One example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says: ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done."" This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful."	3	2		3																					
3722	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives has a happy mood. The author talks about ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" In paragraph @NUM1 which makes the house seem very happy and joyful. In paragraph @NUM1 the author also says ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home the very heart of our kitchen"" this makes the author seem very happy since they like to cook. Narciso Rodriguez talks about ""it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and @CAPS1 celebrated my first birthdays"" the mood here seems that everybody liked to come to this house. This whole memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" makes the mood seem very happy and warm."	3	3		3																					
3724	5	"The mood created by the memoir is shown by many things. Through positive words, often mentioned thankfulness, and a cosy setting, a happy positive mood is shown. Positive words are oftem mentioned in the article for example it @CAPS1 ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people,"" in this the words honest, hardworking, and the pease ""extended a hand,"" (which means offered help) all invoke a happy mood. The authors constant thanking of things, like as the memoir states ""(and for which I am eternally thankful)"", gives a happy mood because people are only thankful for positive things. Finally this positive mood is shown through setting, which sounds happy and is described as nice. as the memoir @CAPS1 ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This descibtion of the setting shows a clear happy cosy, positive mood. The mood created by the memoir is happy, positie, and nice because the memoir is worded with positve words, has often mentioned thankfulness, and has a nice setting."	3	3		3																					
3731	5	The memoir Narciso Rodriguez from The blue prints of our lives, there is a mood. The mood is very happy and positive and friends and family like, for example they just moved from cuba away from family just for his better life. Also it very helping and sellflly becuse even though ther friends and family were in cuba to parnts moved to New Jersey for a new lif for the kide and make a home. this is the mood of the memoir Narciso Rodriguez.	2	2		2																					
3733	5	The mood of the story is some what sad and some what happy. It's sad because he comes from a not welthy family and were immergrants. but happy because he finaly knows the meaning of family and these are the moods of the story.	1	1		1																					
3740	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and loving mood. It sets a loving mood whe the author says, ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood realitive."" This sets a loving mood because the author is pretty much saying that a person can be so close to you and love you that you consider them family even though you are really not even related. It also sets a happy and loving mood when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that Narciso's parents love their children so much that they wanted them to have better lives and to be happy. That is the mood created by the author in this memoir."	3	3		3																					
3742	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. Here are some points to consider. First of the mood of the author is I think greatfulness. For example ""(and for which I am each currently grateful). ... (Which I adore to this day). second of all the mood of the author is appreciation. For example ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 I think another mood of the author is definitely love. I kno this because he talks about love and his family and friends alot. For example ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. In conclusion the authors moods can be described in many different ways."	2	3		3																					
3744	5	The mood of the story is like a sad story then it leads to a happy ending. It starts sad because the family moves from cuba to the @ORGANIZATION1. They tell on nothing about the language or the traditions. It gets happier when they moved into the apartment and they find a job to work at. Thats what the mood of the story is.	1	1		1																					
3746	5	"In this excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a sad story. The mood the author is putting sad and happy stories at the same time. One example is when his parents left from Cuba for his son's own sake for a better place. His parents had great jobs in Cuba. His mother was a Chemical @ORGANIZATION1. and his father worked in a labratory. ""In Cuba @PERSON2,had worked in a laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering."" The author's mood of this story is sad."	2	1		2																					
3750	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It is showing all kinds of memories the family has at one house As it says in the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. It's saying that a house is a house and it doesn't mean much to people and anyone can go there. But a home is where you live, is where you grow up and have all the memories, it's just a better place"	2	2		2																					
3753	5	The mood in the memoir is very calm. It's not very tense and depressing. An example of it being calm is in paragraph @NUM1 when the words are in the parentheses it's like the person is talking to you. Also how it Just states facts and a @CAPS1. Another example of it being calm is how the @CAPS1 is happy and not sad. It has a flow to it.	1	1		1																					
3757	5	The mood is very warm and welcoming. It starts off with a beautiful and culturally enriched apartment. Then talks about delicious foods and great music. But at the end it leaves off on a sadder tone of her parents leaving to make a better life.	1	2		2																					
3761	5	"The mood of the memoir is love. @PERSON1 and his family ""... always kept their arms and their door open to the many people (they) consider family, knowing that they would do the ""same for (them)"" (@NUM1). Even though""(thier) nieghorhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"" (@NUM2) they all cared for each other as if they were one family. Prior to moving to the United States, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in the laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studed chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start thier lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find"" (@NUM3). They moved to the United States, leaving their good jobs, so that thier son could live a better life Narciso doesnt take this for granted. He engulfs the in a profusion of thanks. Throughout the memoir the author costantly writes about all the caring and love in the lives of @PERSON1 and his family."	3	3		3																					
3762	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created in the memoir is a comfortable one. I know this because in paragraph three it says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" That shows that he was comfortable in that house and neighborhood that he had developed a family other than his blood relatives. Also in the last sentence of this memoir it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" That shows that the house had to be comfortable to him if he calls at home, because a home is a place for someone fells safe and comfortable."	4	2		2																					
3765	5	The mood that the author shows is happiness and love. In the memoir he talks about his mom and dad coming to the @PERSON1 without fear and not knowing anything abot the language or culture. Also he talks about when the rest of his family comes his mom and dad lets them in with open arms and when someone needs help to stand back on their feet. The parents were happy about what they did and who they loved.	2	1		2																					
3767	5	"The mood in the memoir is very happy. Narciso Rodriguez, the main character and young cuban boy, describes some hardships such as his ""parents not able to get the right jobs"" or ""facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 Narciso talks about all the good things that happened. Such as his friend and babysitter, Alegria, made him feel great, or how his parents gave him the love of cooking. One thing Narciso will never forget his parents love and sacrifice. His parents always allowed family members to come and stay. Sometimes just to help them get back on their feet. The mood in which the author includes in the memoir is described her Narciso Rodriguez."	2	2		2																					
3770	5	The mood created by the author is the feeling of happiness and warmthe because he's talking about how he enjoyed his old home.	1	1		1																					
3772	5	The mood created by the author is touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm & segregation prevailed in the United States. Also b/c he had to share a house with alot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially & his parents couldn't find a jobs. That's why I think the mood is touching.	1	2		2																					
3774	5	"The mood created by the author was mostly happiness and thankfulness. Narciso's parents came to the @LOCATION1 with courage without any knowledge of the language nor culture. Narciso feels thankful and graceful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. During the whole memoir, the designer is happy. He explained about how peaceful and grateful his... life with his ""family"" was by keeping is Cuban culture and heritage. The author said that the sense of family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. For paragraph @NUM1 and @DATE1, the mood was pretty sad because Narciso described what hardships his parents had to go through to come to the @LOCATION1. He said I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. During the whole memoir, the author describes how much he honors his parents such as how they not only told him life lessons but also showed him. Narciso Rodriguez ended the story with a happy mood by stating he loves his parents for everything they have done for him overall, this memoir had a variety of different moods at certain times depending on what the author was talking about. But mostly, the author was GRATEFUL."	3	3		3																					
3775	5	In the memoir the author creates a homey mood. he shows us the smells and tastes of the food, he shows love from his parents, and he shows grattitude for what he has.	1	1		1																					
3776	5	The mood created by the author was to me appreshiation, and some sympathy. Heres @NUM1 people that gave up their home, job, family, friends in the hope that they can live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. I have lots of appreshiation because its just another example to show how much our parents love and want the best fer us. I feel some-what bad fer the parents because they came from Cuba, and moved to @LOCATION1. They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take imagrants. Most jobs dont take imagrents, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. The love and detication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable. The mood set was appreshiation and simpathy for the people in this story.	2	3		3																					
3777	5	The mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. One of the memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also recalls his freinds and naybors that he used to have over. Even during a time of @CAPS1.S.A racism, the freinds still found ways to make them all happy and all got a long. Another fond memory he re-calls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in cuba but moved to @LOCATION1 in order to have a better home. This taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he finds the true deffinition of family.	3	3		3																					
3781	5	Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. The outcome of that is success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life.	2	3		3																					
3782	5	"The author creates a mood that he is very greatful to his parents. His parents taught him how to cook in a Cuban-style, (wich he loves to cook). ""(and for wich I am eternally greatful)."" His main greatfullness, is of their love and sacrifise. They would take in someone who needed time to get back on their feet, wich he found amazing. ""I will allways be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And he is not affraid to let them know, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repetedly."" @CAPS1 the memoir, the auther creates a mood that he is greatful to all his parents love and sacrifices, not only to himself, but to everyone they've helped."	3	2		3																					
3784	5	"In this memoir about @PERSON1 the reader learns alot about the @CAPS1 by the mood (or tone) of the memoir. The mood of this memoir is greatful, because he is thinking of all the opportunities he got to have since his parents were so caring and selfless.     In the memor the reader learns that parent makes so many sacrifices for their children that helping around the house and thanking them is the least they can do.      In conclusion the mood in the memoir Home: The @CAPS2 prints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is, happy, and greatful because of the sacrifices made by his parents. A good citation for this is ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."""	2	3		3																					
3785	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir was admiration. First of all @CAPS2 felt proud of his parents because they share ""Cooking duties and the work around the house."" @CAPS1 of all @CAPS2 felt @CAPS3 of knowing cuban background and @CAPS2 was proud because his parents were cuban. @CAPS2 was very admire by his parents because @CAPS2 was proud of being cuban two. These is the mood created by the author in the momoir."	1	2		2																					
3786	5	The author creates a loving, and caring mood. He makes it feel that you too could be invited into their home with open arms. That if you are feeling down they would pick you right up with a warm meal and a cozzy bead. He describes that they left Cuba to come to the land of oppertunities. That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1.	2	1		2																					
3788	5	the mood created by the author in the memoir was mutule in the begining it was about move to a New contrey they did seem faced by it they were more into giveing there child a better life and in the end it really sounds like they were all happy they welcomed people that moved from somwhere els into there home and welcomed them I think overall it was a happy mood that was created by the author	2	1		2																					
3790	5	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is very happy. The mood is happy because all you read are good things @CAPS1 put you in a good. one example is ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 means to me that any one can be your family."	1	1		1																					
3795	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", what is the mood created by the author?The mood that the authors creates while writing this passage is very cultural like. Because she reason is. That he uses good detail in decribing the home of the character. For example, @CAPS1 Cuban music (which I adore to this day). This shows that there was some beautifull cultural music.Another way is that he is in a cultral mood is when he says. ""My young parents created our traditional cuban home."" This shows that they took what they had in Cuba and brang it to @LOCATION1. Also that they wanted it to be like home in which they miss.In this memoir there @MONTH1 have been other ways to describe the mood of what the author created. But I think the cultral mood is one of the bigger ones. Thats what I showed you in these two paragraphs."	1	2		2																					
3800	5	In the memoir the mood created by the author is the mood of happiness and appritiation. This has the mood of happiness because it just fills you with happiness to know the everyone can be one big family no matter what race and having realized that anyone can be family even if their not a blood relative. This memoir gives you the feeling of appritiation because it makes you appritiate what you have and appritiate having any kind of family. Also just to have everyone united as one and be thankful for my culture and it kind of makes me want to explore my culture and express it more.	1	2		2																					
3801	5	The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think thats what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up. Narciso also talked about what kinds of things happened at his house when he was a kid. One thing he talked about was how his landlords daughter was his first babysitter and first friend. He also talked about how his parents showed him thier cooking skills and thier passion for cooking.	2	1		2																					
3809	5	The mood was a little sad at certian times and greatful at others. It was sade that they have to leave Cuba and start all over agin. It was greatful becase they hade family that loved them and cared for them.	1	1		1																					
3813	5	"The author shows many moods while writing this memoir, like gratitude, happiness, and love. The main mood in this memoir however is gratitude. @ORGANIZATION1 is very grateful for everything his parents have ever done for him and he loves them with all his heart. Also he is grateful for how they always made him safe. In the last sentence Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had. So he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside."	2	2		2																					
3814	5	"The @CAPS1 created by the auther is that in paragraph @NUM1 it States that ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home. It was verry heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwitting pakd onto me their rich culinary Skills and a love a cooking that is still with me today."" I think this relats to the @CAPS1 of the memoir because living in @LOCATION1 you could Still have a house and life stile like you were Still living back where you live, in this case in Cuba."""	2	2		2																					
3815	5	The mood of the storry is happy. She discribes how lucky she is to have parents like her own, and be Cuban. She loves the music, the food, and the culture. She's glad her parent were careing and helped people.	1	2		2																					
3823	5	There where many different moods that the author created in the memoir. The three most important moods where grateful, loving, and happy. The first mood the author showed for this story was being grateful. This family was very lucky to move from cuba to the @LOCATION1 and find a better home. They where also lucky that they where going to have a better life. The second most important mood was loving. This family showed alot of love for each other. An example that shows how loving they are is when it @CAPS1 they left their family, friends, and careers so their children could have a better life. The last mood was happyness. When reading this story you can really tell that this family was happy. It talks about how they will never forget the memories and how generous their parents where. In conclusion there where many different moods in this story. The three main moods where grateful, loving, and happy	3	3		3																					
3825	5	"The mood created by the author is welcoming. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. ""In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells and lovely cuban music playing. In conclusion, the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir, especially when he is describing his home"	3	3		3																					
3833	5	The mood created by the author is welcoming and warm. The author makes it so that you want to be @CAPS1 and being able to smell the good food. Also just being able to appreciate the cuban culture.	1	2		2																					
3834	5	The mood in the memoir is basicly showing love, happiness, and friendship. The way that the mood shows love is in @CAPS1 @NUM1 and @NUM2. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 is says Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 it talks about how his parent welcome refugees to celebrate their arrival to @LOCATION1. Happiness was shown throughout the story. And friendship was shown as well The way that friendship was shown by his parents keeping their door open to whom who did not have a home. But let them stay in their home until their back on he or she is back on there feet, and considerd part of the family.	2	2		2																					
3838	5	"In the memoir, @ORGANIZATION1 the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS3 is hard and happy.The first place in the story when the @CAPS3 creates a hard mood is when they say that racism is overt. ""Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 immigrants overt racism"". this show that the mood is hard because we know that at that time racism was occurring so that made it hard for them to fit in with everybody else.The last place in the story were the author creates a happy mood is when the neighborhood came together. ""In our neighborhood, despite custom elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship"". This displays a happy mood because is represents a whole bunch of diffrent people comming together to work together.As you can see @CAPS3 creates two different types of moods hard, and happy."	3	2		3																					
3844	5	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 is very cozy and welcomeing. Inside the @PERSON1 home the @CAPS1 describes a cozy and friendly atmospher. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed bot, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This quote shows how cozy or ""warm"" their home is. In the memoir he also explains how welcome people are and that everyone in the Apartment building was friends or even family! ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me the great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote means that in his welcomeing home friends were also concidered his family. Narciso Rodriguez had a wonderful @CAPS2 to grow up in."	2	3		3																					
3846	5	The mood that is described in this story is love. Why did I pick love? I picked love because in the story it says a lot of stuff about family and Cuba and home (Cuba, is where the love (family) is. In this story is states that his love comes from his family and love comes from every family and @PERSON1's loves his family he says it alot in the story.	1	1		1																					
3876	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez it shows the story of how a young boys home and parents have changed his life forever. Originally from @LOCATION2's parents immigrated to the United States in 1956. They started off in a small apartment then later getting the money to move into a ""simple house."" ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relation."" @CAPS1 some of the most loving families are not related.     The mood in this memoir is inspiring to the narrator. This allows the reader to feel such love and happiness which is being expressed. ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do to give their children a better life."" The narrator is explaining what courage it took for his parents to make such an adjustment for the sake of his own happiness.     Overall the memoir ""@PERSON1"" is a story full of love and should be told for generations to come. The main lesson here is don't take your family for granted, the narrator is forever grateful that his parents ""turned this simple house into a home."	2	3		3																					
3877	5	"The @CAPS2 is trying to describe his house when he was a kid. In this case he describes his Cuban heritage and how being @CAPS1 is really fun and amazing. The @CAPS2 is saying that the Cuban kitchen is pouring out with amazing foods and during holidays his ""Family"" would come and visit. Cuban is a very exciting culture is what pops into my head after reading this story. The mood is that festivitys and holidays are the best for him."	1	0		1																					
3879	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was simply love. for his family and the people @CAPS1 him. Especially his parents who came to @LOCATION1 from cuba. And At first they struggled but they knew that there was hope and happiness in the near future. Love for his culture that came from cuba with the music and food. And most of all the place he had called home Not the space, but everything and everyone @CAPS1 him.	2	1		2																					
3883	5	"The mood created by the author is one of loving mood. The author is very grateful for all that his parents did for him. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""...and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" @CAPS1 loved how his parents loved him back too. They came to @LOCATION1 for him to have a better life. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 loves his parents for the sacrifice they made for him. The author wrote, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author has created a loving mood in his memoir."	3	3		3																					
3894	5	The mood in the memoir is happy and thankful. I think this because the memoir is talking about how this boy apreshiates that his parents moved just so he can have a better life. I know this because in the last paragraph the boy talks about his family and how he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house to a home. So thats the mood of the memoir.	2	1		2																					
3900	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood created by the author is lifting because it shows that race doesn't matter when it comes to unity or friendship. It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so that their family can live a better life. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how the family doesn't have to neccisarily blood related and can be someone you love and will help you. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting.	2	2		2																					
3905	5	"The mood in the @ORGANIZATION1 is displayed as happieness and appreciation. Narciso understands how much his parents had given up for him by moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. They also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him. He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". by this he is saying it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable. The happieness comes from the appreciation because you cant appreciat something and it doesn't make you make a little bit happier. his happieness is also portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying ""I will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice""."	3	3		3																					
3911	5	The mood the other Created was how happy narciso was because her parents gave up so much for her to have a better life and education in america.	1	2		2																					
3926	5	"This memoir definatley has a strong and apperent mood, and that mood stands out to me as Narciso being grateful, he is obiously very thankfull to his parents and family. I know this because the memoir says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" This quote really shows that @PERSON1 is thankfull for his parent's love for him.This mood comes out in the memoir when @PERSON2 says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and @CAPS1 are."" This quote shows how he is thankfull for his Family, but also how his Family shaped him as a person.In all, There are many emotions in this story, but the one that @CAPS2 out to me the most was him being gratefull."	3	3		3																					
3927	5	The author created a mood of immense gratefulness. The author knows that not every family (Cuban or possibly @CAPS1) can all get together and be truly happy and grateful for what they have. Not every family can work well with everyone else. Not every family can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others. This is a feeling of gratefulness because of the parents. The authors consistantly praises them on their courageous acts, and even going against the law to help those in need. The parens brought such happiness by welcoming those who are different and sharing happiness with them. The author had an incredible experience and is eternally grateful for having such wonderful parents that she had.	2	2		2																					
3945	5	"The mood created by the author is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and relaxing. I think that because all he's talking about is his family and how much his parents did for him. For example in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I will never forget how my Parents turned this simple house into a home."" To me that sounds like @CAPS2 because he knows he can always come home to his Parents if he ever need help. Another example is in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I learned there about how to love"". That to me sounds like when he was growing up it was rough and he never actually loved some one in his life until now."	1	3		2																					
3946	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is immense gratitude, happiness, and admiration. Rodriguez describes his home @CAPS1 writes, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). Rodriguez expresses happiness reminiscing about his home that was ""warm."" @CAPS2, the mood shows admiration towards his parents. @CAPS1 writes, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, withot any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (@NUM2). Rodriguez admires his parents for coming to @LOCATION1, ready to work hard, despite the problem of knowing nothing about the country. Lastly, the mood can be described as thankfulness, or gratitude. Rodriguez writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). The house was more than just the physical part; his parents filled it with love and compassion, and Narciso Rodriguez is extremely greatful The overall mood of the passage is greatfulness and happiness"	3	3		3																					
3948	5	"The mood of this memoir was appreciative. The author reflects upon his experiences at home in a positive manner which expresses the fact that he is thankful for what he had. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful) (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows Narciso's appreciation for the culinary skills his parents passed down to him. The extra information in the parentheses also provide a grateful tone to the piece of writing. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The language used (grateful) shows the intence thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word ""grateful"" is used repeadtly. The use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important. So grateful appears to be a keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age"" There is so much passion in this phrase. ""There is no way to express my gratitude"" shows that he's just so thankful there is not way to even express it. The author really shows the reader that he is appreicative of his family."	3	3		3																					
3952	5	the mood in the memoir can be exaessed in many different ways. The memoir is mostly eprssed with gratitude from Narciso to his parents. He describes in good detail all the sacrifices his parents made for him. Leaving behind all their friends and family, the hot climate, and their cultures back in Cuba. Another mood expressed in the memoir is love and kindness. Narciso's parents were kind to everyone. They turned their house into a hotel for people who needed help until they were ready to go. They had open dinner where friends and family members came. Even when they struggled financially they still let everyone in. Narciso's parents made the biggest sacrifice for him. What they did for him created the beautiful moods described in the memor.	2	3		3																					
3958	5	"Based on the excepert, the mood created by the author in memoir was being grateful and happy about his life.The first example that the mood created by the author in memoir was being grateful. This author this author was grateful for his Cuban culture and heritage. In paragraph @NUM1 it tells what he is grateful for (cuban music, food...). Here's an example from this text or passage "". My young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the Kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwitting passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" That's an example how he was grateful.The second example that the mood created by the author in memoir also was being happy about his life. In paragraph @NUM2 it explains how he is happy about his life. Here's another example from the passage, ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That was another example of how this author was happy about his life."	3	3		3																					
3966	5	"The author set a great mood of love and gratefulness in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 explains that his parents left Cuba with quite goods jobs. His father worked in a laboratory and his mother studied chemical engineering. They both came to the @LOCATION2 and had to work in whatever job they could find, although they deserved much better ones. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is very thankful for what his parents have done, how much they have given up in order for their kids to have a better life His parents showed him in their everyday lives the spirit of how to be generous at such an early age, and the true importance of family and friends. They didn't just ""tell"" him to live this way, they based their lives in this belief. that's the reason @CAPS1 has taken these teaching to be the basis of his life. These are the ways in which the author sets a mood of love and gratefullness in this memoir."	3	3		3																					
3981	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was love. One way that he expressed this in the memoir was by saying that his man had let in other immigrants to their house. Also a way that this was expressed was by saying that his parents selflessly left Cuba to get a better life for their children. Furthermore the author of the memoir expressed this by saying that his family turned this simple house into a home. This is the mood that the author created in the memoir	2	2		2																					
3987	5	The mood the author created was a peaceful mood. She was bringing up good memories of her past life in her home. She was saying how she was eternally greatful for everything her parents gave her and taught her. Her parents tought her much about her heritage when she was young and kind, she lived in a very diverse area growing up there were Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. There were times of racism and violence. The overall mood she created in this memoir was sad, happy and peaceful.	2	2		2																					
3988	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez by The @CAPS1 prints of our Lives the mood in many thing. The mood is the feel of happiness in his house of his family shows him love and his culture and heritage. I think this becausein the story it say ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many thing I learned there. about how to love """	1	1		1																					
3990	5	"In the memoir, the mood the author creates is peaceful. @PERSON1 says his family has a warm home, which means it's nice and quiet. Where @PERSON1's family lived, the different cultures that lived in the neighborhood were friendly with each other. In @PERSON1's family, they had countless extended family members who usually joined the family at the table for a nice meal and family get together. @PERSON1's family welcomed many people to their family. @PERSON1 was very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. His family had many rich culinary skills. Their best skill was cooking, which was fun and relaxing to them. Finally, growing up in the environment in New Jersey gave @PERSON1 a great sense that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Clearly, @PERSON1 and his family were very friendly and did many things that were peaceful."	3	3		3																					
3993	5	The story I just read was inspiring. I relized that your true blooded family isnt only your family theres other people that you can bond with and after a little while you can become family according to how close. The mood created my the author was happy. It was happy because everything he said in this story was true and it made me feel lucky to have such a great family and freiends that I call family.	1	1		2

He is happy that said ""times"" were so great.He is grateful for the happy times they had together like cooking, music, and so on. But he is mostly grateful for his parents turning his house into a home."	2	1		2																					
4000	5	"@ORGANIZATION1 creates a warm, comforting mood in a piece of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. He does this by explaining what goes on in a positive light. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congression of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm homes."" This quote uses words like celebrations and warm to show that this place was a comforting place that always had a great time. This shows how Narciso Rodriguez created this warm, comforting mood."	2	2		2																					
4001	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the mood created by the author is gratefull and family. Throughout the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez talks about his life growing up. Readers read things like: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage,"" and ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1, towards the end, the author explains that he is very grateful to have his parents: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."", and ""in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generousity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" @CAPS2, Narciso Rodriguez was greatly influenced by his family during his childhood, and his memoir shows that along with how grateful he will always be."	3	3		3																					
4002	5	"There is a very distinct mood set by Narciso in this passage. He talks about Faith, love, courage, and just the overall niceness of his home and community. He speaks of the ""innocence of childhood"" and the ""gratitude for the spirit of generosity"" impressed upon him at a young age. I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, of course he ""groups"" the last two together because of the deep, emotional way they all felt. Gratitude is one thing so he doesn't have."	2	2		2																					
4009	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is being together. This mood is created by saying how his parents created a traditional cuban home in New Jersey. Also, when he said that that his parents always kept open arms and door. I think that ment that they were willing to let people stay with them and help them out when they were having a hard time. Also, when he said that everyone in the neighborhood despite there customs came together in friendship.	2	2		2																					
4013	5	"The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, in the memoir was grateful and it had gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" His parents sacrificed their families, friends, careers, and the country they love to selflessly come to @LOCATION1 to give their son a better child hood because they loved him that much. Even though they had to change jobs and take any possible work. They also struggled with finances, harsh northern winters, and cultural hardship that wouldn't give up and that's why the author was grateful, creating the mood. "	3	2		3																					
4017	5	"The mood of this story is happy, hopful, and caring. In some paragraphs, the mood shifted and felt upsetting and gloomy (p @NUM1) ""They struggled both personally and financially."" At these parts in the memoir it felt sad and hopless to see what struggles they faced. But then it shifted. Narciso used words like, ""courage, selflessly, love, family, and celebration."" This transformed this memoir to an exciting and happy story. They never gave up hope and all the imagrents helped eachother with their problems. This is set a mood of selflessness, and caring which is what the Rodriguez family brought to the United States."	2	2		2																					
4019	5	"In the excerpt by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of his home is created. The mood in his home is always happy, and thankful.

4020	5	"The story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", has a comfortable and loving mood. This memoir sounds almost cozy, in some ways. If you read paragraph @NUM1, you can imagine just how happy the kitchen table was when @LOCATION1 (landlord's daughter), Sergio, and Edelmira (""surrogate grandparents"") were around it. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it talks about the Passionate and Cuban music"" that filled the air ""and the ""aromas of the kitchen"". If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I don't know what does! Love must have been a main factor in the author's life because it is evident in the excerpt. This story talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what. The first sentence in paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That alone says how much love there was in the house. The mood of this story was very comfortable and very, very loving."	2	3		3

The whole second paragraph is wonderfully written it makes me feel like I honestly was the experiencing his home & the love & kindness of his home. The love & friendship @CAPS1 shared with the people of his neighborhood is also shown in that same paragraph & as well as the other ones too. @CAPS1 shows so much love & thanks to his family & friends & his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph.

The mood made it really easy to understand and read.The mood of this story is not funky or funny. The mood is like haveing a regular conversation with a person. I like when the author adds little perenthesis, it gives it a personal touch and adds more of a conversation touch to the mood. For example in paragraph @NUM1, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)."" Its more of a fun fact or personal note.In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" has a very formal mood, with a personal twist.

4041	5	In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, there is a main mood created by the author. I think this mood is happiness. To Narciso and his whole entire family, family is the most important thing. No one leaves a family member out. In his neighborhood there mostly lived, Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. All these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso's parents came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. When I read this memoir I felt happy reading it. It let me know how other families who really have nothing, have everything. Narciso's family is very close, and caring for one another, and to them family is the only thing that matters.	3	2		3

In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the @LOCATION1. They taught Narciso rich culinary skills that he would never forget. Narciso also learned how much his family and friends mean to him. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and a demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In paragraph @NUM1 it said ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Narciso's friends and family taught him the real meaning of the words family and home."	3	2		3																					
4094	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, there is a clear mood created by the author. For instance the Cuban background set the mood of happiness. Narciso explains, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I'm eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows her love and happiness from her Cuban background. Also another mood set by the author is greatfulness. Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso is clearly greatful for her parents for leading and guiding her life to happiness. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez creates the moods of happiness, and greatfulness throughout the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4097	5	"In the memoie, ""Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood the character created was greatfull. One way he was greatfull was because he talked about how he grew up with his family and was happy for every thing his family went to help him out becoming someone in life. The author apreciated everything they have done for him even though they were immagrants but still helped him out. In conclusion the authors mood that he created was greatfull."	2	2		2																					
4105	5	"The mood in the memoir doesn't change alot. Narciso Rodriguez mood is happy in the end because @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS1 also says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 there I think Narciso is happy. The mood is mostly calm & happy because @CAPS1 telling the courage his parents had. Thats the mood the author gave."	2	2		2																					
4110	5	The mood in this article was just stunning because explaining how your parents were very good and explaining how they raised you well gives people the thought this is very good especially when you are having fun with friends and family.The author just set off a good mood towards the readers in this article: because people like to read something that would make him or her happy and this story made me feel good about my self and family just like the family he/or she has in this article	2	1		1																					
4117	5	"I think the mood of the memoir is overall positive. The charactor is always complimenting his parents and is always telling him he admires ""their strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 of the memoir is the child complimenting the parents and culitur. Narciso strongly adores him family."	1	1		1																					
4121	5	I think the authors mood is, honored, proud, loving, and appreciated. I think the author mood is part of being honored because (in paragraph @NUM1) he really expressed how he feels about his parents being so loving and makes others feel loved and welcomed. I also think he was proud because, he explains (in paragraph @NUM2) how much he appreciates his family and his parents to have open arms and help thoughs in need, and to have such great parents that he does'nt even have words really to express to commitment and kindness his parents have with everyone. Through out the story the author alway's mentions How loving his partent are and you can see in the passage that he picked that trait up with the words and expression he used in the story to express the fact of his parents being loving to their family and their @CAPS1. Those are what I think are his moods and the reason for them.	2	2		2																					
4135	5	"In the memoir there were actually two main moods. The first mood and most prominant mood was joy and happyness. Because throught the memoir the reader learns about the writers family and how greatfull the writer was for her family. An example of this is when the writer wrote: ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, because though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir. Meaning this was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. Therefor sadness is also a mood in this memoir. In the end, the joyfull mood sort of covers the depressing one, but to really get a sense of where the writer is coming from the reader most consider both these moods."	3	1		1																					
4140	5	"From the memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of gratitude and love. The author's gratitude is to his parents for their cultural and selflessness for leaving their family and friends so their kids could have a better life. one line that really showed this was ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1). That line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage. He loves his Cuban family with all their traditions. I'm aware of this because of a line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez is constantly creating a mood of gratitude and love in his memoir."	2	2		2																					
4141	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness. Rodriguez explains how appriciative he is of his parents and every thing they have done for him. Making his house a home and always being there for him. He talks about friend ships and familys, but family being the relation ships between their friends even if they werent blood realitives. Overall he thanked his parents and said ""in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."	2	3		3																					
4142	5	In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a reflective and relaxed mood about his memories. For example, his use of parentheses create a voice for him through which the reader can better understand what he is trying to say. Also, by reflecting positiely on old times, it feels as if the author is right here next to the reader, having a pleasant conversation. For example, when he is talking about his landlord's daughter, @LOCATION1, he mentions how she would often grace his table with her presence.Furthermore, by describing the enviroment of his apartment, it feels to the reader most as if we are sitting in a wood backed chair listening to the sweet saranade of an unamed Cuban singer. The smell of spices lingers in the air, The smoke from a stove waters the eye's as it drifts lazily out the window. The sound of engines and the beep of horns created by the low roar of a bus plays in the backround. The bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the furniture burn pleasantly in the eyes. This reflective and relaxed mood is so important for the author to get his stories across, and Narciso Rodriguez does it well.	1	1		1																					
4143	5	The mood that author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because this is proud of his culture. He loves his parents and loves that house that they turned into a home. The author exsplains how his life begain in new jersey and how proud of his parents he was and that he looks up to them and plans on carryinging out the culture and triditions that his family had so that's what makes me think that the mood of that the author sets was happiness and fullness of this familys life, and as I read this passage I was glad and happy for him that he admires his family that much and how happy his life was.	2	3		3																					
4144	5	"The mood created in the memoir could be of happiness, gratefulness and love. The author describes in the memoir how his parents left their country Cuba to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they love (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The author express gratefulness by saying his grateful for his culture and the sacrifice his parents did (@CAPS1 @NUM2). To conclude the author also express his feelings about the house he use to live, you learn the real definition of ""family"", he is really happy about the welcomes his parents use to do when other refugees arrival to this country. At the end the author says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3)."	3	3		3																					
4149	5	The mood in this article is happy and grateful. I think it's happy because Narciso tells you how much fun he has with his parents and close family, and how much Narciso likes living where she lives. I think its grateful because Narciso got the education that he wanted and everyone around him was so proud of Narciso. I feel like the mood is mostely happy and grateful	1	1		1																					
4151	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love. Narciso and his family had so much love that they were able to overcome struggles and help others to overcome by allowing them to stay in their home, and live with them. They allowed people who weren't even apart of their family to become part of their family, they loved and cared for other, possiably even more than them selves and gave up everything they had in cuba to come to america for a better future for their children. The amount of love in this house is what turned it form an ordiary house and into a loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home, not only for Narciso but for everyone in the community, and family"" that was created. That is what the mood of this memoir was, and in whom created it."	2	3		3																					
4153	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is happy, grateful. In paragraph @NUM1 the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" In paragraph @NUM2 ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture."" @CAPS1 therefore I say the mood of the author in this memoir is happy, grateful."	2	2		2																					
4160	5	The mood of the author of the story is happy and sad. Happy because he is so grateful to have had parents like he did/does and sad because all of his childhood wasn't great but having a family made it happy and it made it seem more like a home and where his family should be	1	1		1																					
4161	5	"When I read ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I thought the mood was warm and thoughtful. ""family had nothing to do with being blood related"" I thought that was welcoming and  showed that his parents didn't care who you were or what culture you believed in. He would always thank his parents, because they had left cuba so that their children could have a better life. His parents thought that if they get through the bad time they will enjoy the good times to come and for that he always thanked them."	3	3		3																					
4165	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love for family. He writes about how his parents and other immigrants moved to @CAPS1.S.A only for a better life of their children. He writes that in a way which could make the reader feel that he is extremely happy. He also talks about how his parents taught him to cook and talked to him about Cuban culture. He was extremely proud and grateful to his parents to teach him all these. The author writes about how this small simple home was very special home to him and also how much it meant to him. Also this house has been this special to him, by spending his childhood there and also how he got love from his parents in this house. This was the house where he was able to learn what the word ""family"" really meant and also how it made him happy about how he would never in his life be able to forget his family. These love and happiness were the the moods created by the author in the memoir dedicated to his family."	3	3		3																					
4167	5	"The mood that is created by the author is joy. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parent's are immigrants who works hard. They could've stayed in their own country but they wanted a better future for Narciso. When Narciso realized that he felt happy and filled with joy. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents."" When you're grateful you feel happyness. This is the mood that I think this author created."	2	2		2																					
4169	5	The mood of this story is very weird. This story is about different cultures coming together as one. Narciso's parents are very nice and generous. His parents are always taking in @CAPS1 needs a home, and treats them like family. Narciso still has some family in Cuba, and will might be able to meet them until a later time in life. Anyways the mood of this story is very heart-warming, Narciso was also thankful for everything he has, Narciso's parents have a lot of people to feed since, There is more than one family living in their home so It is hard for them. Well I think the mood of the story is great.	2	2		2																					
4191	5	The mood created by the auther was happy, thoughtful, and very polite. Narciso talked about his family and his life! He also was talking about how he loved his family and what he does best like cooking and playing his Cuban music.	1	1		1																					
4194	5	The mood created by the author is quite comforting and homey. As the author describes his life growing up at home as a child, he seemed to have a pleasant life. when he (the author) ex plained how greatful he was to have learned all the things he had from his family, it portreyed a simple but very enjoyable mood. When the author spoke of his family and friends that came to dine in the apartment that was made into a home, Narciso created a very relaxed mood. Everyone who came to the Rodriguez's home was welcomed and treated as if they were close family. The overall mood of this memoir is friendly and welcoming just as the Rodriguez's home was.	3	2		3																					
4201	5	The mood is very loving and happy. The way he talks about the neighborhood he grew up in and everyone was so close. Than how he talked about how caring and uselfish His parent were. Just how gratefull he is made the memoir very happy.	1	1		1																					
4203	5	"The mood is well many different things. But mainly the mood is loving. I think it's mainly loving because in the memoir at both the begining and end, Narciso talks about how nice, sweet, and caring his parents are. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" And in that sentence you can see that both Narciso's mother and father would always welcome people into their house."	2	1		2																					
4205	5	"In the memoir the mood created by the author is gratefullness. I know this because in the memoir it says, ""But, in reality, theres is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This evidence shows how Narciso Rodriguez was grateful which is the mood of the memoir. His parents taught him how to love his culture, (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The way the author puts the words and uses them shows the mood of the memoir is grateful."	2	3		3																					
4206	5	"Narciso Rodriguez's @CAPS1 from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, creates a very optimistic mood.Narciso describes how even though ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"", he and his ""family"" (which included foreign neighbors) still overcame adversity. In addition he describes how even though his neighborhood shared different cultural backgrounds, they still lived together as a family. Lastly he describes all the memories and celebrations that helped shape his house from a living space into place of love and friendship. It is real easy to tell that Narciso loved his family and friends all the same in a way that shaped his life."	2	3		2																					
4210	5	The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir was regular becacuse in the story (Narciso Rodriguez) he explains his life a little to the reader he explains how they lived in cuba then to america and the boy also explains how he loves his home, and celebration and heritage in america the boy talks with  like same kind of smat tone beacse he's really explaining his like then about really now and hear he likes is so theres no anger in this story. 	2	0		2

Narciso is very happy he learned such great cooking in his childhood. ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (@NUM1). Being so happy made this such a warm home in @CAPS1. ""I will never Forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM2). Narciso summed up his entire article in one sentence and creating what most people feel at home. At my home I feel everything Narciso does because its not were you live its how you live."	2	3		3																					
4231	5	"The mood that they author creates is kind of happy for what he has. ""In our neighborhood, despite costums elsewhere, all of their cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The quote @CAPS1 how the author thinks of the different cultures uniting together."	2	1		2

""The barriers to work were strong and high and my parents both accepted that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they had deserved."" ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr.. Had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied Chemical Engineering."" In @LOCATION3, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" Is what I thought the author in the memoir mood was."	3	2		3																					
4239	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving, caring, and gratefulness. Throughout the memoir the author continuosly mentions how grateful she is to her parents. and how much she loves them. She says that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author means that she's thankful her parents love her enough to give up their home, jobs, and friends, all to give her a better life. She also says that ""what they [her parents] did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done.""

The quote show the loving, caring, and gratefulness expressed in the memoir by the author."	3	3		3																					
4245	5	"I think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family. He wants to tell us about what they did for him. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home.'"	2	2		2																					
4247	5	c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here.

I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because they moved to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.""

Also the feel of his home reflected on the mood. It was a warm and safe environment in paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS2 can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood."	2	2		2

The author show that no matter if your rich or poor, you can still have a closely knit family.	2	2		2																					
4270	5	"The mood created by the author is that he is realy happy that his parents moved to america to live close to friends and family because in paragraph @NUM1 it says"" countless extended family members came and went -- and there was alway someone temporarily staying with us."""	1	1		1

He is also grateful that his grand parents came to @LOCATION1.	1	1		1																					
4276	5	"In the memoir Narciso rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.  I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	3	2		3																					
4286	5	"By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort. The mood created in this story shows how family should be. When @PERSON1 says that ""they take anyone in until they are back on their feet"", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. These three parts set the ""mood of the story."	3	3		3

4292	5	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is a loving one Rodriguez is looking back at all the great memories of himself and his ""family"" when @CAPS2 was young.When living in new @CAPS1 as a child, Rodriguez lived in a very loving home, and a very loving neighborhood. Rodriguez refers to the people living in his neighborhood as family, claiming ""... 'Family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" @CAPS2 always had neibors an friends over which @CAPS2 considered to be ""family."" The was alot of love in his neibors, and so @CAPS2 grew up with a lot of love around him. But, of course, @CAPS2 loves his parents the most.In this memoir Rodriguez is thanking his parents for being so selfless and loving him so much throuout his childhood. Rodriguez is looking back on how great of a childhood @CAPS2 had, living in a great loving neiborhood, with parents that love him alot.Narciso explains the true definition of family in this memoir, and thanks his parents for loving him as much as they did."	2	2		2																					
4293	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong. Narciso's mood mostly has to do with his family, friends, and most importantly his culture. Narciso is very happy and lucky to be born in the United States and have a chance to grow up there. Second Narciso loves his home. He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is greatful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not. Also his ""real"" grandparents wich weren't his real grandparents because they were still in cuba. Those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4296	5	I believe the mood of the memoir is happy and enlightening. I think this because @CAPS1 someone imagrate from a certain country of poverty or unjust laws this community or neighborhood will take you in. this community is made up of Cuban spanyards and italians all have left there homelands to persue a better life for either them, the family, for there kids In conclusion the mood of this memoir is happy because it is enlightening and welcome place to be.	1	2		2																					
4299	5	"In the @CAPS1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives,"" @PERSON2 creates a very distinct mood. I think the mood of the @CAPS1 is Warm, caring, comforting, and very loving. The author's home is very family oriented, but not to just blood family. His neighborhood was all family when ""Racism was the norm and segrigation prevailed."" When Narciso Rodriguez discribes this the @CAPS1 sounds comforting and loving. He @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This brings a happy, light feel to the article and coforting as well.When Rodriguez @CAPS2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" the mood changes a bit. Now it's admiring, grateful, and compationate. As Narciso Rodriguez discribes his parents Struggle so he could grow up @CAPS4 nicer than they did you can feel hes very grateful and loving. The mood is happy, loving, and full of compasion at this point This is the mood created by the @CAPS1 by @PERSON2 from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"""	3	3		3																					
4303	5	"In the memoir the author creates many moods with in it. In the text the first mood he created was caring because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows caring because they would let anyone that was family and wouldn't care. The next mood he showed is being grateful because in paragraph @NUM2 he says"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"". This is him showing that he is grateful because he says it in the sentence and he also tells the reason why he is grateful to them. These are the moods the memoir created."	3	3		3																					
4306	5	"I think the mood of this story is warm and loving. Narciso's Parents never had a big home in the United States but they turned a small house into a home.In a @NUM1 bedroom, two family house in @LOCATION1's parents created a traditional Cuban home. A lot of cooking hapened in the house. Family was always around which must've been fun, and all of this hapening with Cuban music playing in the back ground. ""@CAPS1 the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen. Narciso makes his home seem like a very loving home."	2	1		2																					
4309	5	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir was, gratitude towards his parents.In the memoin the @CAPS1 thanks his parents for raising him the way they did.

4312	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a sort of grateful, appreciative mood. Throughout the memoir, Narciso repeats how grateful he is to have such courageous parents. For example in the first few sentences of paragraph @NUM1, ""My mother and father come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind thier families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""  this shows how grateful he is for his parents, to do all this, just to give him a better life. I would feel just as grateful For my parents if they had done this for myself, just as how Narciso felt."	2	2		2																					
4313	5	"The mood created by the auther in the memoir are love, happyness, and @CAPS1. Love is one of the moods because they welcome people in need ""My parents always Kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, Knowing they would do the same for us. Happieness is one of the mood because Narciso is pleased with parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and secrifice."".  @CAPS1 is one of the moods because all every one in the neighbor hood got along. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship.""."	3	3		3																					
4316	5	"In @PERSON1 from: Home: The Blueprints of our Lives the author creates a warm and loving mood. When @PERSON1 talks about his parents and how they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" that sets a loving mood because if one is so generous and caring to do that, it means they love you and they care about you. Also at the end of the memoir Narciso says that he ""learned there about how to love"". @PERSON1 now says this about his house because his parents were always so up beat and caring that they showed him what love is. Being loved makes all people feel good inside."	3	2		3																					
4322	5	I think the mood was happy @CAPS2 the @CAPS1 talk about a @PERSON2 named narciso Rodriguez and that he lived in Cuba and he's parents moved to the United States so the family could Be together and I think that the @CAPS1's mood is happy @CAPS2 this story was great a talk about a @CAPS3 and his parents moving to the United States.	1	1		1

4327	5	"The author of the memoir creates a very loving, peaceful, and happy mood in the story. It is always saying that his house was always filled with friends and family. This gives the story a very loving mood and shows how they are all there for each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to lif in our warm home."" This sentence shows that the home is very loving and warm. Lastly, the mood that Narciso has throughout the memoir is very greatful. He is always saying how much he appreciates what his parents did by moving to @LOCATION1 to create a better life for him. That is the mood of the memoir throughout the whole passage."	3	3		3																					
4328	5	"The mood in this memoir is very moving and heart-felt. By the way the author writes about his family @CAPS1 can just feel the warmth and love that his family provided for him ""... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" @CAPS1 can just tell by this quote how much of an impact Narciso Rodriguez's parents had on his life. It also explains how crafted his parents were and how intelligent they were. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @PERSON2 most deffinatly loved his family. "	3	2		3																					
4330	5	"The mood of this article created by Narciso Rodriguez in ""The blueprints of our lives."" Is selfessness, admiration, gratitude, and thankfullness.

4331	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir are pretty good. The author shows that he really does appreciate his parents and thanks them for everything they've done. He calls his home a warm home. He remembers the inocence of childhood, congregation of family, friends, and endless celebrations. He states that he had a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. And I think what he's trying to say is you dont need to be blood rellated to be family, just love and care about someone."	2	2		2																					
4333	5	In the memoir narciso rodriguez by The blueprints of our Lives The mood the author created in the memoir was grateful the author created that mood because he was and is still grateful abought how his parents left behind their family and friends and Jobs so that he can have a better life also the mood is grateful because they passed on their rich culinary skills to him. Also he is grateful for livving in a simple house with all those wonderful neighbors and freinds. I think the mood created by the author is grateful because this is a memoir of all the good things in his life and all of the stuff he should be gratefull for having.	2	2		2																					
4340	5	The mood created by the auther is that of the american dream. It is a very happy and successfull theme with roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants that hopefully had simallar stories. In each paragraph there lines that have relation With freind being family and how his home was phisically quant but emotionally it was a place of love. That enhances the mood of happines in the story. Also the fact that in the story racism and segration were set aside and neighbors were relatives because of who they were not were they came from. That is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that. lastly the story tells times how the parents sacrifice for their sons better life. That has probably touched most of reader close to hom so the mood would now becom very serious. This short memoir is a great story to bring you mood from sad to hopefull and thankfull that you live in a place you can call home.	3	3		3																					
4342	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one. A reason why I think this is by talking about how he and his neighbors (of different descent) All got along very well in solidarity with one another which creates a sense of love. Also when he talks about happy times like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen they are having a good time, laughing, and listening to Cuban Music. Lastly when he and his family take in family or even just really close friends who they consider family conveys a true sense of happiness, peace, and love.	2	2		2																					
4343	5	"The @CAPS1 of this memoir creates a mood that is very touching and meaningful. It shows the hardships his family had to overcome as well as the good that came frome it all. The @CAPS1 states in his memoir, that, although his family was going through tough times, they left their door wide open to family that needed help and always had the thought of others in their mind. He explains how hard it was for his parents to leave their home and jobs in cuba, but that they did it for him, so he would get to live a better life. one more thing the @CAPS1 said in the memoir that was very touching was when he said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me..."" These words show us how much of an impact his parents action had on him and how they helped him in life. These are some examples of how the @CAPS1 describes the mood."	3	3		3																					
4344	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is very appreciative and grateful. The author, Narciso Rodriguez, is grateful and appreciative for his Cuban culture and that is also amazed that his parents could be so courageous to leave Cuba, to come to @LOCATION1.

4351	5	I think the mood of author in the memoir is thankful, proud and happy. @PERSON1 is extremely thankful of what is has, disspite what has happened through his life. He is proud of his Cuban heritage and is still proud of it today. He listens to Cuban Music and cooks Cuban food. Also his is happy.

For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing. In his neighborhood, Narciso says that ""cultures came together"" and that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love."" I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too."	2	3		3																					
4362	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful mood from beginning to end in his memior. First of all, he describes the selflessness of his parents. Narciso explains that ""they had to start their lives over entirely."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States. He understands that they only left for his benefit, and he appreciates that. Also, Narciso is thankful that although his parents moved to the United States, they kept their Cuban traditions. In Narciso's three room apartment, ""Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Lastly, Narciso expresses his appreciation, and strengthens the mood by defining what a home is. He claims that he ""will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). For these, Narciso is grateful for, and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood."	3	3		3																					
4375	5	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, she uses key terms and phrases to discuss the mood in paragraph @NUM1 she says, ""Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This line puts a clear picture in your head of what it would be like to have lived in that home. Another time Narciso Rodriguez puts a clear picture of the setting in your head is in paragraph @NUM2. She is stating where her parents must live and says, ""braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics."" This line puts the setting in my mind which makes it more clear to picture the home and setting. Narciso does a great job describing the mood of each location."	2	0		1

4392	5	"This memoir really sets of mood of love and comfort. It does this when he tells us that his parents immigrated just for him. Than it keeps that mood going when he tells us about all the people that come over regularly for dinner. His parents loved him and made a great inviorment for him like he said, they ""made a house a home"""	1	2		2																					
4398	5	"The mood in the memoir changes. But overall the mood is sad. It tells how Narciso's parents give up what they had for the better of their children. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Also, most of Narciso's family did not have homes for a while which is sad because they do not have a place to call home."" Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" Narciso's parents gave up everything for him to have a better life. They left the place they were most @CAPS1 in for him.

The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful."	1	2		2																					
4420	5	The mood created in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is a grateful, cheery tone. As Narciso talks about his parents' Cuban background and tradition, by his tone you can tell how proud and happy he is in his heritage. Also, as in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, he talks very highly of his parents, how they made their house a home, and how grateful he is to have them as parents. The mood makes me think of the color yellow, and of the sun, happiness and warmth. Narciso Rodriguez did a great job setting this cheery mood in his memoir.	2	2		2																					
4421	5	In my opinon I felt like his culture ment a lot to him and I felt that her house and family and friends was all important to him. In the frist paragraph he describes his family, where they lived where they came from, how old was they and it made me think about my culture and family. In the second paragraph it tells what year she was born in and how his house was and I wanted to describe my old house the only house with more memories then I could think of. His neighborhood is a close tight community with honest hard working immigrants. It made me think about how all are community could be if we was hard working. In my opinon her memories made my memories come back.	1	1		1																					
4426	5	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives is grateful. This is shown by how Narciso explains in detail the major chronologically ordered events his life. Narciso also includs little sentences in parentheses explaining what he had just said or telling how grateful he was for it. This happens for example when Narciso states: ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows how he is greatful his parents taught him how to cook, which he still does today. Narciso also shows his gratefullness by making it abundantly clear how gratefull he was to have parents that taught and did so much for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez created gratefullness as the overall mood in his piece. the did this by showing how thankful he was to have parents who taught and did so much for him."	3	2		3																					
4429	5	The mood created by the author memoir was upset to have to leave cuba but happy to be somewhere better. To have to leave memeries and friends and family is upsetting. Also its better because now their lives will get better. Everything they had befor they will soon have here. The mood created was upset but happy and excited.	1	1		1																					
4432	5	"The mood created in the memoir is very loving and caring and it shows appreciation to the authors parents. The author (@ORGANIZATION1) explains how it was for him as a kid and his ""family"" doesn't always mean a blood relative. He describes the household as being very humble and always had open arms and welcomed others. He also says that it wasn't about the size of the home or how expensive it was, it was about the people inside it and how close they were and the memories they shared. All in all through this memoir @PERSON1 (the author) shows that he is very appreciative of his family and wouldn't change how we grew up and thanks his ""family"" for impressing the spirit of generosity upon him in an early age."	2	3		3																					
4436	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, it explains how your house can effect you as a child and when you grow up. The mood of this memoir to me is comforting. I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and freinds that probably made him feel comfortable. Also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why.	2	1		2																					
4439	5	"I the exerpt Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives There is a specific mood set on the exerpt I think its love and @CAPS1. for example in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my birthdays."""	1	1		1																					
4444	5	The mood in the memoir was in a way sad. The reason why it was kind ave sad is how they came into this country with nothing. They had to live in a @NUM1 bedroom apartment. Even though that they still made it up to being able to make money. They got a better living style too.	1	1		1																					
4448	5	"There are many ways to describe the mood of the memoir. One way I could describe the memoir is that it makes you fell good about things.

4456	5	"In the short story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood of the short story is grateful and reasonable. In the story a man named Narciso Rodriguez twenty-seven years old migrated from Cuba in 1956 with his parents to come to the United States. When they came they had to live in a one bedroom apt. they could afford nothing else. But Narciso was being very greatful. Even though they had nowhere to to work in places with bigger pay. So they only had little pay to feed there family. Narciso is greatful in paragraph @NUM1. @CAPS1 says ""They struggle both personally and finanacially braving the harsh northern winters."" @CAPS1 had to settle for what was given to him at the time."	2	1		2

4465	5	"The mood created by the author is fairly formal, with a few informal parts. For example a formal paragraph, like paragraph number one, sets the stage of the whole memoir and uses formal transitions like ""After [living]"". Also, the paragraph is very informative, telling about his parents imigrating to the @ORGANIZATION1 from Cuba and how they were financially poor + could not afford a fancy home like they could in Cuba.An informal paragraph in the memoir is a paragraph like number six where he is describing how thankful he is for his parents being as selfless and giving as they are. He also uses informal transitions such as ""But, [in reality]."" And ""these...,"". It also just has an informal tone to that paragraph.As a conclusion these parts of the memoir have a good balance of formal + informal settings to keep the reader engaged."	2	1		2

My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" @CAPS1 more, his parents left the country Cuba to have a better life for there children. In paragraph five it says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carreers in the country they love."" @CAPS2, he thanks them and admires their strenght and preserverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" As you can see, the mood of the memior created by the author could be described in many ways. "	3	3		3																					
4480	5	"I believe the was more of a ""thank you"" in the memoir and here a three reasons. I think Narciso Rodriguez is thanking his parents for making him have a good childhood. Like in the excerpt ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Another reason I think he's thanking his parents because he was praising them. In the excerpt ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 Narciso is forever grateful to his parents. Like in the excerpt ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" These are the three ways the mood was more of a ""thank you"" kind of thing in the memoir."	2	3		3

4485	5	This passag has a very calm and happy mood. He is looking back on his childhood and the memories. He talked about the cheerful house, people and neighborhood. You could picture the house and smell the aromas. Narciso set a very nice setting and tone that the entire passage was lifted in energy. You could tell he was passionate about what she was writing. He showed a real admiration for his childhood and the people he shared it with. The way he felt about her childhood was potrayed beautifully in this piece and that really helped the reader get into the happiness and community like feel. Her gratefullness potrayed into the mood and made the entire piece fun to read.	2	2		2

The author portrays his love for his parents when he explains how selfless they were in immigrating to @LOCATION1, and sacrificing so much for the sake of their children. They also show unity by explaining how close everyone in his neighborhood and family are. They all share a similar culture, and they consider a lot of the people in their neighborhood family, even if they are not blood-relatives. A lot of their family lives close by, and they often spend time together, usually for meals as it says in paragraph @NUM1.	2	2		2																					
4489	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The blue prints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso explains the mood of his home. One way is in para graph @NUM1 when he says ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixed with the aromas of the Kitchen"". This @CAPS1 the mood of family. It gives you this sense of a warm family.Another way is in paragraph @NUM2. He says ""My parents always Kept their arms open to the many people we considered family"". This gives a loving and caring feeling. It also gives the sense of family.The last way Narciso explains the mood is in paragraph @NUM3. In this paragraph he just gives an overall warm and inviting mood. He says how appriciative of his parents he is. He really @CAPS1 the mood to be thank ful of everything they have done. These are a few ways Narciso @CAPS1 the mood of the memoir."	3	2		3																					
4491	5	In this paragraph I'm going to tell you the mood created by the author in the memoir I just read. One mood that the author had was happy. The reason why I said that is because everytime he spoke about being Cuban or about his family, he spoke with this joy or pride in his voice. Also when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't his a real grandparents until 1970. He sounded a little deppressed about that. I also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir. Those are the moods that I think the author created during the memoir.	2	2		2																					
4493	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir was happiness. He/she wasn't sad at all because all his/her memories were happy. His/her memories taught him/her what family was. The tone the author gave out was joy. ""Endless celebrations"" ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"". Not one of his/her memories he/she talked about showed any sadness for he made a lifetimes of friends. The author showed us a calm and grateful mood for everything that have happened. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The author wanted to express a lot of gratitude for what his/her parents have done for him/her. Through his/her parents Narciso Rodriguez have so much happy memories. Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was anything but sad and his/her memories taught him/her family."	2	3		3																					
4496	5	In this memoir, the mood is very light hearted and kind. It gives you a feeling of peace and community.Several times the author tries to show appreciation. Not for any one thing in particular, just gratitude. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he puts phrases in parentheses for no reason other than to show gratitude for his life as a child. As a result of this, while reading you get a feeling of peace and kindness.Because of his repeated display of gratitude, the mood is light hearted and unserious.	2	1		2																					
4500	5	In this memoir, the auther creats a mood. The mood that this author creates is the gratefulness. The reason that I say gratefulness is because Narciso Rodriguez is so greatful, and so happy to have two loving, caring, selfless parents. He's grateful to have not only a house, but a warm, cozy home, where he's grown up in and had so many memories. He is grateful to have all the perks of a traditional cuban home, with the food, the music, and all of the people Narciso is grateful that his Parents basically just gave up their own lives and dropped everything, so that he could have a better life. Nariso cannot imagine @CAPS1 to @LOCATION1 not knowing the language, not knowing anything, and leaving everything he knows behind. However that's what his parents did. they sacrificed so much for him. and he appreciates that more than anything. I think that the mood that the author chose for this story was perfect.	3	3		3																					
4503	5	A mood for the memoir would be redeaming. It would be a redeaming mood because it talks about strugles like being an immagrent and being poor. It also talks about how a community that is going through the same strugles can come together and help each other out. The author also mentions how her parents sacrificed a lot to help her acomplish what she has become today. Since there are tradteties that help the author lead to success it would be a redeaming mood.	1	2		2																					
4506	5	The mood set by the author is very solemn. He started by telling the scenery he lived in during a time of segregation. That was hard because he was Cuban. He didn't have a lot of money, and lived in an apartment. His life was like a somewhat below avereage life today.Towards the middle the memoir was still serious but happier in a sense. It was happier because we Know that he could have more life opportunities in @LOCATION1. He grew up and actually met people and made friends. Also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him. He made the memoir and nice and passionate.The moods started off a bit shaky and very serious. Then he got into a happier mood by telling how his parent and family were good to him. It ended in the same mood started in the middle of the passage, happy.	2	2		2																					
4507	5	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is a comfortable. It's comfortable because as I read the memoir it made me think of my own home life. And how important my family is to me. It also allowed to see how full and good his was to. I mean I love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells. Also, the wonderfull music that played and the people that always came over to visit. And all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another. That's the feeling I get when I read Narciso Rodriguez's memoir.	2	3		3																					
4512	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author explains the true meaning of family and home. The mood is extremely deep and pearsonal as he describes the love and selflessness his family expressed. He explains that his mother and father emigrated from Cuba and moved to @LOCATION1 so that Narciso, their son, would have a better, successful life. Reading this memoir, I can picture Narciso getting very emotional expressing how grateful he is for his parents and family. He explains, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@NUM1). This sentence and last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal. It went from happy, appreciation, and an explanation of his life to deep, incredibly personal, and to his complete thoughts. Narciso had a great love and admiration for his family and friends like most people should be able to experience like Narciso writes about in his memoir."	2	3		3																					
4513	5	The mood created by the author was a very unique one. The author was remembering and charising the memorys he had of his old home. He described his home by saying how brave and courageous his parents were to give him a better life also how his family was so rich in culture and how his family and neighbors would always visit because times were tough but the authors parents never turned them down. The author made it sound that it was the perfect childhood and described it with such detail and passian and that is why the mood is so unique and special.	2	2		2																					
4514	5	The mood created by the author was warm, welcoming, and gratefulness. When the author described his home, it gave a feeling of warmth and it was very welcoming. He made me feel like I was invited to his home with open arms and I could feel the environment around me.

He showed in the passage the warmth and love in his home.	2	2		2																					
4521	5	The mood of this memoir is love and staying a family. The author sends a message to her readers when one leaves what they once had. Her tone tells the mood by writing with passion. The mood is basically is being happy with what you have. that's how the family written about acts in this memoir.	2	2		2																					
4524	5	The mood the author created in the memoir was joyful and optimistic. In the memoir, the author describes his home and how even though the house wasn't much, his parents made it feel inviting and comfortable. In his neighborhood, all the people were friends and took care of each other when they needed help. The author's home reflected the Cuban culture because of his parents. The author describes the hardships his parents had to go through like adjusting to a colder climate in not getting good jobs. Even though they had their own troubles, they were selfless and didn't let their problems get to them. The author is very grateful for how his parents gave him a home and taught him what a family really was.	3	3		3																					
4528	5	The mood of this memior is slightly diffucult, somewhat depresing, yet gratefulness and now I am going to explain to you how. The mood is slightly diffucult and depressing because there is a different culture and a brand new language. Also in the united states you have to have get a new job. This short story is also gratefull because you have a amazing oppertunity to start a very better life and get a great education.	1	1		1																					
4530	5	The author creates a grateful mood. The author writes about how his parents had good jobs in Cuba but left everything to give their children better lives. He also writes about how he grew up, which is parents teaching him about music, cooking, and family. His parents never got the jobs they deserved because of the barriers to work for their children. The author is grateful for the things parents did for him so he could get a better life.	2	2		2																					
4531	5	"The mood created by the author of the memior exposed various emotions and contrast. In paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, the author talks alot about culture, he explains how they could not live without having their practice, in their lives. ""Rich culinary Skills and the love of cooking (and for which I am internally grateful). Passionat Cuban music (which I adore to this day) ...""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity"". Another mood the author captures is greatfullness. In paragraph six the author explains how he is so grateful for the strength and courage his parents showed from moving away from Cuba. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have done."" The final way the author creates a mood is during the last sentence of the memoir. The author states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote captures the mood of being thankful for the unity of his family. He looks up to his parents for making his life as great as it is today. These are some moods the author creates throughout the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4538	5	The author of the memoiar was writing about a boy who grew up in @LOCATION1 and loved his first home. the @CAPS1 of this story is that happiness can be created and kept in one place.

4544	5	The author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neigborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was where I learned the real definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home	2	2		2																					
4545	5	"The feeling in this article when it talks about family is love, peace, happiness, and gratefulness. Narciso understands that his parents left everything in Cuba for him. @CAPS1 could tell that his parents love him very much and @CAPS1 is grateful for that. In paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 has the opportunity to be born in @LOCATION1 and having a better life. Narciso also learned that @CAPS1 could love a non blood relative because they could be his family too. There were many people that were like family to him. @CAPS1 loved them and they were happy spending time with each other. In this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving."	2	2		2																					
4547	5	"the mood created by the author, I would say good. there very gratefull to there parents about everything. family is very important in the excerpt. In paragraph @NUM1, where it says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both"" is an explanation of how and why there so gratful towards there family. In paragraph @NUM2, where it says ""growing up in this great environment instilled me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" explains that being close to someone doesnt mean you your blood related."	2	2		2																					
4548	5	The mood the author created in this memoir is very happy and relaxed. It is also very opening. It is opening because it says we let anyone we consider family stay over for however long period of time. They are very happy and relaxed because in paragraphs @NUM1 it seems like everyone is mellow, and greatful to be in this country. They are so happy to have decent jobs, and new lives. This is the mood the author swings into the story. The author did a great job fixing these into the story to make it flow very well.	1	2		2																					
4550	5	"The mood of the @CAPS1 of the text ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very thankful and happy. I can tell this because in @CAPS2 @NUM1 it shows how greatful @CAPS3 was to live in that house with his parents.

And finally in @NUM3 the @CAPS1 tells the reader how @CAPS3 was thankful for immegrants for giving their children a new begginning @CAPS4 are ways you can tell the mood of the @CAPS1 in the text"	2	2		2																					
4553	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir was more of a homey-heart touching mood. To know that his family helped other immigrants in their time of need, in any culture, was really getting the point across. That where you live is just a house until you make it a home.	1	1		1																					
4557	5	The author did a good job bringing different moods into the memoir. There was a sad mood but also happy at times to. When there was a happy mood the memoir was more enjoyable. The last sentence leaves people knowing he wouldn't trade it for anything	0	1		1																					
4561	5	"The mood was calm as if it was a wonderful place to be in that will also makes like wanting to live their forever. As in the relevant it says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"".

In the memoir, it says that Narciso thanked his parents repeatedly for what they have done. He also states, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close � knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants, who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""

4567	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a loving mood. I think he creates a loving mood as opposed to something else because of the way he describes and explains things. For example, when he is describing his parents cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". The phrases in parenthesis portrait to me a loving mood. Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community and his parents sacrifice is shown by these next to quotes ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"", ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially,"". The detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving mood for  all the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir."	3	3		3																					
4569	5	"I think the mood the author is trying to give is thankful, and satisfied, and that he is loved.

And an example of his thankfulness is ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today..."" And lastely an example of him being loved is ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" I can tell that Narciso feels all three of those feelings and he presents it well."	3	2		2

He will be forever grateful to his parents for these lessons that have formed his life."	3	3		3																					
4858	5	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez stays constant through out the story. First, ""growing up in this environment in stilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative"". This quote talks about when Narciso's mom and dad take people in their house that need a home, but they are not blood relative family. Second, ""my mother and father came to this country not knowing the culture of language to give me a better life."" Even though his mom and dad knew nothing about the language or culture in @LOCATION1, and didn't want to leave friends and family, @ORGANIZATION1's mother and father sacrificed it all to give @CAPS1 a better life. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 means that its a simple house but it turned into a safe home with all the people @CAPS2 loves around him. All in all, the mood of this memoir is happy. The author makes all his challenges happy."	3	3		3																					
4861	5	"The mood created in memioar Narciso rodriguez is unity as shown in paragraph @NUM1 ""Our neighborhood was made mostly up of spanish, cuban, and @CAPS1 Immigrants at a time when over racismn was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere. all of these culture came together in a great  solitary and friendship. It was a close knit community of honest hard working Immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind who were clearly in need secondly they had courage as shown in paragraph @NUM2  My mother and my father had come to this country with such courage. Without any knowledge of the language and culture. They came selflessly, as many @CAPS2 due to give their children a better life even though It meant leaving behind their familys frends carrers and the country they loved. That is the mood created by the memiour."	1	2		2																					
4869	5	In this memoir the author gives the mood a sense of inspiration, as well as the love of family and friends. In the memoir the author talks about how great it is that the author's parents had turned a simple ordinary house into a home, which means that the author's parents had made thier house to feel like home by bringing their Cuban culture into the house, such as Cuban food, Cuban music, and Cuban decoration. That makes the memoir a happy mood. But there is also inspiration to this memoir because it basically tells readers that it doesn't matter who your blood relatives are, family is family, people who love and care about you the most.	2	1		2																					
4873	5	The mood created in Rodriguez's memoir is one of gratefulness + happiness. There are supporting feelings such as coziness + friendlyness but Rodriguez himself most exhibits gratefulness. In paragraph @NUM1, there is a great catalogue of gratefulness to the social skills that were passed down to him. When in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about their cuban feast, a small one perhaps but with true love + life. You get a true sense of the gratefulness Rodriguez displays for his parents not because of who they are or how much money they have or what they give him (materialistically), but being genuinely grateful of the nature + kindness bestowed to him.	2	3		3																					
4878	5	the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy for remember the most important peoples on his life, the poor house were he lives when he had his first birthday and a different kind of people in the place were his family live, he was grateful for everything to his parents gived to him when he was a little boy and the education how his parents give it to him.	2	1		2																					
4880	5	Based on the auther in the @CAPS1, the mood created by the author was happy and sad, I sead that the mood created by the auther was happy because he lived in a comfortable with made by thier neighborhood was mostly, Spanish, Cuban, and italian immigrants at a time, it was no rasism, no segregation he lived his home peaceful, and the sad thing was that NARCISO RODRIGUEZ learned how to love and the the definition of family and about how to love but he saed that he would never how parents turn house into a simple home.	1	2		2																					
4882	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez is an internationally recognized clothing designer. He talks about his hometown in Newark, New Jersey. In the memoir, he offers the true definition of ""family"". I felt like the mood was comforting, and loving, and heart-warming. Just by the way he talks about how much he loves his Cuban heritage, and how his mother and father immagrated from Cuba, to @LOCATION2, and how, even at a young age, they still managed to raise him, and do alot for him, and give him the best childhood they could give him, that he'll always remember. He also talks about how ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", meant that you could even consider someone not blood related to you, as your own flesh and blood, family."	2	3		2																					
4887	5	The mood by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is happy. When the author talk about his or her memoirs it seemed like they felt happy having those memoirs to talk about. Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there. So if I was in the author's shoe's I would fell good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of thing that mean a lot to you. That is what I think the author's mood is.	2	1		2																					
4891	5	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, many moods were shown and created in the memoir. One mood shown in the memoir is great love. In paragraph three, Narciso wrote, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 mood described in Narciso's memoir was gratitude. In the final paragraph, the author wrote, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" A last mood produced in the memoir was pride. In paragraph two, Narciso wrote, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Many positive emotions were created by Narciso Rodriguez in his great family memoir."	2	2		2																					
4903	5	I think that the mood that the author created was a unpleasnt. One beccause he lived in a one room apartment so that must mean that they are poor. and that they live in a poor town without any food.	0	1		1																					
4904	5	The mood in this memoir is one of gratitude. This is first seen in paragraph @NUM1 when he talks about cooking and Cuban music. It is also in paragraph @NUM2 when he talks about leaving their home countrys. A third time is seen in paragraph @NUM3 when he tries to say thank you, but can't find the right words. The mood in this memoir gratitude and it is easiest to see in paragraphs @NUM1, @NUM2, and @NUM3.	2	2		2																					
4905	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir could be strong to many people once they put it together. Narciso's parents started of in a home that meant nothing. However, Narciso's parents turned it into something great. In the last sentence of the memoir Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. What he was trying to explain was your home is what you make of it. That is what I believe the mood created by the author in the memoir is."	1	2		2																					
4911	5	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our lives, the mood in the memior is emotional & loving. In this story the @CAPS3 talks about how his Parents are immagrents. How his Parents we're nice enough to let people stay in thier home & how the let people w/ them"	2	1		2																					
4913	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is a warm and happy one. He does this by talking about homes, friendship and his neighborhood.                                                                                                                                  He creates this happy feeling by talking about his home. He talks about his simple house in which was created a cuban home. His kitchen has aromas of food filling the air. The rich skill of cooking was passed on to him. In this house he had the innocence of childhood.                                                                                                                         The second way he creates a happy mood is talking about friendship. He talked about how his land lords daughter was his friend and babysitter. This led to a playful warm tone as he lead to his grandparents who also enjoyed a meal at his house.                                                                                                                                                         The last way is talking about his neighborhood. He talked about how the immigrants in his neighborhood all helped each other. They all came to @LOCATION1 hardworking and willing. The author also wrote that family doesn't need blood.                                                                                                                                                                        Those are the ways that the author created a happy mood in the memoir	3	3		3																					
4917	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir is... to show how to be grateful. Appreciate what you have in life. Like in the memoir Narciso lives in a apartment with one bed room. But he loved it there was and is good memories. Narciso quotes on @CAPS1 @NUM1.... ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thank them repedatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon, me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are.                                                                                                                                                                                           That quote told every thing the whole mood of the story and the very last sentence                                                      ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	2	3		3

4920	5	There were several different moods created by the author some were @CAPS1 peacful. Like he was talking about his first @CAPS2 warmth of the kitchen cuban the feast. The mood of courage of his parents moving to the united States. Hes admiration strenth and perseverance for his parents. The faith the struggle hard times. 	2	2		2																					
4921	5	The mood in this memoir is caring, happy, and loving. First, it is caring. For example @PERSON1 would do anything for his family. If @PERSON1 did not do anything for his loved ones he would not care for them. Second, it is happy. For example @PERSON1 has a baby sitter and his first friend. Lastly, it is loveing. An example is when he talks about his parents. He is very greatful when he talks about his parents and the mood describes that by makeing the home feel loved.	2	2		2

You can tell that the mood is happy because throughout the memoir the author tells about all the good times that they had in their house in Newark, New Jersey. The author tells about how her family would always come over to her house and have dinner there. He/@CAPS2 also tells about how their was always cuban music and cuban food. They used to have fun at that house. That's how you can tell that the mood is happy."	2	2		2

The mood created by the author in the story is alive, hopeful and cultural. Narciso said that his parents created a traditional Cuban home alive with Cuban food and music. Thats stating the mood was very cultural. Throughout the story it was hopefull they left Cuba and only lived in a @NUM1 room apartment but his parents were hopeful they would succeed. It was also very alive they always had someone other than their family at the table had doors open to family and friends. The Cuban music and food aroma drifted through the small place. Narciso Rodriguez will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home."	3	3		3																					
4930	5	"The author creates a sense of unity and happiness when she explaining how she had grown in her home, her neighborhood, and with her parents. Narciso first begins to tell us about where she grew up and how she was brought. She says that she was born in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey. She also says that she had lived in a traditional Cuban home and how she is thankful for her Cuban roots. Then Narciso continues by telling us about how there was a great sense of unity and ""family"" growing where she did. She says she grew in a neighborhood where everyone was one big family. Towards the end Narciso tells us how much she is greatful for her parents and their love & sacrifice.

4940	5	"In the memoir from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of this seems to be overjoyed, and happy. His life so far in @LOCATION1 must be great. For example, Narciso talked about how his sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Also, about passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. As well as the love and sacrifice of his parents that was given to give him a better life. But most of all the mood gets serious at times, like when he talked about how his parents turned the simple house he lived in into a home. Then, how it was in @LOCATION1 he learned the real definition of the word ""family"", and how to love, etc. In conclusion, the memoir jumped from overjoyed and happy into very serious and real."	3	3		3

4946	5	The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates is gratefullness. When I read this, I feel thankful like the author. Although his family had a good life in Cuba, they left to give their kids a better life. @CAPS1 the author's family hadn't left Cuba, I think the mood would be different. Then the author wouldn't think his parents were selfless (for that reason, anyway) @CAPS1 my parents did that for my siblings and me, I would want people to feel grateful as well. @PERSON1 understands how hard it was for his parents. Another mood could be guilt. I feel guilty when I read this because I don't always thank my parents or apreciate them. Narciso Rodriguez created a lot of moods in the memoir.	2	1		2

4953	5	The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez is very happy and uplifting. The whole story is an optimistic view of Narciso's child hood. None of the bad parts of his childhood are written about. He writes about his perent's coming from Cuba and how some of his family would come and eat with them. Narciso's memoir is a happy look back at his child hood.Narciso is very grateful for his family, specifically his parents. They came from Cuba to @LOCATION1 to start a good life for their son.

There are many examples of this in the memoire. One is when Narciso Rodriguez says ""the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the back drop to life in our warm home.""
