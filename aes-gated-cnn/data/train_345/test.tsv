2	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. He was in the desert, which is dry and hot. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the  temperature was hot and made every thing around him hot, �brackish water faling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Since he was in the desert, there was no escape from the sun. The text  states, �The sun was beginning to beat down�(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out, no one could help him. � and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgous day in June�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town� but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). Thesettings that the cyclist was riding in wasn't good ones and so they negativly affected him; causing him to be dehydrated and tiredin the end."	2	2		2																					
3	3	Everyone travels to unfamiliar places. Sometimes we get lost and ask locals for directions which @MONTH1 not be a good idea. The setting affected the cyclist. He had a perfectly good map but asked older men who look like they haven�t been out in ages. The old men apparently haven�t been out because they gave the cyclist the wrong directions.  My advice would be to not listen to anyone no matter their age if you have a perfectly good map with you. Also try to know where you are going at all times. �Yes, sir!	1	1		1																					
6	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. For instance, it was extremely hot and dry. Also it  was nearly deserted, almost all of the places he crossed were deserted .A  lost her features of the setting were a ram shackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that caldnt hald in the lamest move.an is the feature give you an idea if haw the cyclist feels.  	1	1		1																					
12	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist very much so! The cyclist is riding through the hot desert. Meaning he needs lots of cold water to keep him hydrated. The longer he rides in the hot sun, the more he sweats, the more likely he will get dehydrated. If he was riding in the rain or snow it could possibly slow him down also, because he would be cold and his muscles might get stiff and not be able to move as fast. This is why the setting affects the cyclist very much so. 	1	1		1																					
13	3	"There was many features that affected the cyclist such as heat and lack of water. The cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having little water left. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� That shows he wasn�t prepared with enough water for his trip to Yosemite. Without water he/she would die from the heat. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke"" This states that he @CAPS1 the danger of not having enough water in his system. Features such as water and heat affected him/her throughout the story. Not having enough water could make him/her lose more sweat and the heat is making him lose even more sweat which can cause extreme heatstroke."	3	2		3																					
17	3	Many different characteristics in a setting and determine the outcome of an event there. Im the story, Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the cyclists journey was affected my a few weather relouded things. The heat was an extreme thing that showed him down and in most cases detened him from reading his maximum level of ability. Also the time of your in which this labes place, greatly affects the cyclist. Lastly, the type of road and amount of ground that he has to cover after affects his performance. Overall, setting can be a determining factor in a journey as they life	2	2		2																					
24	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the lock of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. He frind the water but e tar like substance come out and it tasted like battery. When he left he had to go through rough road which he couldn�t travel that fast leanes of the condition of the road.	1	1		1																					
28	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way. This ways are pysical and mental. The pysical ways that features affect cyclist is the terrain. If the roads are long and wiredy, this could wear the cyclist out. They could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep. When it�s you against gravity, it can be egausting. The temperature can also be a crusal factor in a cyclist pysical ability. Nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding. The cyclist and also be attracted mentally. If the terrain looks deserted or anything like a desert the byciclist instintaniously thinks �dehydration� and �death.� If some people see dead animals or bones they would think they could die. If they see vulture circling them they would get afraid and think death, but the worse thing of all is that knowing all of these things are in the same place at the same time. This is how setting affects cyclists	3	2		3																					
29	3	The settings of the story were grveling. While the cyclist was riding along, the sun was beginning to beat down on him. The cyclist began to sweat due to the heat and thus he drank just about all of his water. Now the cyclist was experiencing major heat, sweat, and dehydration. The California desert is a grveling place to be, especially in June. Luckily, the cyclist did come up to a camp and found fresh food and water, before he would eventually continue his way to Yosemite National Park	2	2		2																					
40	3	The features of the settings affect in the story �Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit� it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart. Then..leaves and see these wide bunch of hills. inconclusion I would never do all the riding he did.  	1	2		2																					
54	3	The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
55	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the main character the cyclist. The cyclist is biking �through the high desert of california in June.� So naturally it can be infereal that it is not and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases �a tarlike substance followed by brackish water� he is runningout of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that �l cald drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service causing more anxiousness and dispare l have had an experience similar to this where l wat out walking in a state park in the @DATE1. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow covered trees made me feel at if I�d never be warm again similar to He cyclist who�s environment made him feel hes wald die of dehydration. So, as can be seen. He setting of this short story affects the cyclist.   	3	3		3																					
58	3	"I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills� this shows that he is a warm and trobled by the change of the terrain. He also fells alone �I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path� he also. Though he was in a ghost town. �Summer time� rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my detorating brain"" he felt that he was slowly dying. He also though he was losing it, the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was no seeing a mirage. But through it all he had hopes the author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things dont look good keep moving foward never look back and alway's be positive and take advanage of your surrounding. This is the message the author tries to give"	2	2		2																					
60	3	The features of the setting effects the cyclist by the way that the auther started talking and how he sound at the beginning of the story. When they both at the picture he looks like hes cecilla ssing and then ceoos. To the story and goo continue ties reads. It doesn�t sound like he is enjoying his ride, because of the niuse he was down on the bumpy roads, sparkes, and the bor of counter tirst he doesn�t have. hes sacting time and sec from add perso doesn�t mic at all because there could hou old �timers and don�t know once thou are tailoring around her, to save, to goo shouldn�t take advice from them because goo could end its line this nidsnes transitin califend doesn�t and how feres how could now do it, to let some or therefore so be dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
65	3	The setting effected the cyclist in a great way. The snakes blocked his pathways, and hi short water supply made it hard to continue. He felt as if he could drop of a heatstroke. His environment, and the information from the old man made his ride very hard to continue. All in all, his settings had a big effect on him.	1	1		1																					
71	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist traveled miles on a bike dealing with the weather in the deserts, little bit of water, and being tired. The cyclist faced many hard times trying to travel on a bicycle from one point to another.	1	1		1																					
75	3	The features of the setting affect the cylceist by the ground would change terrian a lot makeing it difficult to ride at the same speed the entire way. Also, the lack of water made it hard to focus. I think the features of the setting affect the cycleist by people think they are worse than the actually are.	1	1		1																					
80	3	The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the �town� had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this �town� is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road.	2	1		2																					
82	3	The affects of the features around them affect them by the hot bikes so the bikers need water and also it affects them by the roads are so hill so they can�t just road. Stight so they need to go over the hilles and that affects them because cycles are very hard to land form a jump.	1	1		1																					
84	3	 The bike rider in the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by @PERSON1, is greatly affected by the condition of land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running, low on water. However since it is such a dry place he can�t find any. Also since it is out in the middle of no where, there is no one he can ask for some. If this story was set somewhere else he wouldn�t have has either problems.	1	1		1																					
85	3	"In ""rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Many visual features create a very deserted area thats hott in your head. For example in paragraph five they use alot of adjectives to describe how abandon the place was. Words like ramshackle and rusty. Also how often the lack of water was brung up made us think of how hott this California desert must have been. Also the heat made the cyclist belive he was seeing a miracle when he saw the Welch�s fruit juice factory. The choice of visual words in this story are words to describe what affected the cyclist."	1	2		2																					
86	3	In the passage,the cyclist had about @NUM1 different settings. One of these settings were the rough terrains he had to pass through where he lacked on the amount of water.Another setting the cyclist had to go through was the hill like terrains.Where he was laughing at himself for taking the old men advice in the first place.Both of these features had a great a tall on the cyclist body strength and his spirit. But with confidence, determination, and the relief of the success he was able to overcome the obstacles.	2	2		2																					
89	3	The features that affected the cyclist was plenty of things. One thing would be lack of water. In the text he said the pump gave water that taste like battery acid. Another one would be all the surroundings changed from what the old men sald and he got lost. When he was lost he had to have determination to find someone say that he could survive.   	1	1		1																					
90	3	The setting and it`s features affect the cyclist greatly. He is in the desert and all the town's are abandoned. Also he now hits a sign that says �Rough Road Ahead�(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1). This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up, old, beaten roads. And he has the sun beating down and is almost out of water.	2	1		2																					
99	3	The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn�t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
112	3	There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	1		1																					
114	3	The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact was June , hes in the desert and has low on water were what almost lead to his own down fall. This hot desert setting sounds hostile and am I�m surprised he lived and that he was that lucky.	1	1		1																					
118	3	"The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, �affect  the cyclist in major ways. First, when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, he is reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living. The text states, ��A young   pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung  my head �   (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). The  text later states, "" At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..."" (kurmaskie). This tells that the cyclist feels de pressed and is majorly affected by these sights. This could and would later ruin his self esteem and think about diying."	2	2		2																					
120	3	The setting of the essay didn�t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, �a ghost town.� @CAPS1 this couldn�t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is �traveling through the deserts of California in June.� Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels.	3	2		3																					
122	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the essay, it states, �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.� This statement might affect the cyclist in the way that, they fear if they get into any trouble there is no one around to help out. This statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way. In the essay, it states, �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral they couldn�t had in the larger mule greeted me.� This statement simply gives the cyclist the impression that this particular town is juice, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, @MONTH1 be decades. The different features of the journey of the cyclist in the essay, many would fear the outcome,if they over fear the journey and turned �old timers� who had never left their porches, in order to experience such things.         	1	2		2																					
123	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because, forty miles into the desert, I arrived at the fisrt �toun�. The setting of the desert affected the cyclilst because the cyclist, because cyclist was arising doun the road when the men with the settings came and affected the cyclist. The man was very crazy. Her water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of driead sweat circled my shirt, and ?? he ?? that should drop from heatsroke on a gorqeas day in june simply because I listened to some gentleman who were it been off their ??? ???, ??? to tough. This my responese to the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
130	3	"The features of the setting affects he cyclist. One way it affect the cyclist is it by being hotlike a says in the text""I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgerous day in June ""@CAPS1 way it affects the cyclist by being bumby like it says in the text ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" that is how the setting affects the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
140	3	As the features changed in the setting it becomes harder for the cyclist .At first the cyclist stoned off pretty easy .He had plat smooth roads to go through .He started out before the sun could to him.� The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite my name written all it �He kept his mind off the sun and this helped him .Then, he got to a highway that made it kind of harder .I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills �So he had to pedal harder and would tire him faster.� At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path. Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state �.By the tumble weeds that means he was in the desert during a hot period of time .So he had little water left and he was becoming dehydrated .This was a hard task for him to overcome .By the terrain changing it become harder for him.	3	2		3																					
150	3	During his cycling trip, the author had to endure extreme heat, face snakes, deal with little or no shade and survive a dire lack of water, all problems related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes of becoming dehydrated, and describes, �the sun was beginning to beat down and l was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 struggle for him was crossing the path of a �ridiculously large snake� and �trying to keep his balance in his dehydrates state. Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme heat, and upon reaching a water pump, finds the water to be unfit for drinking and �in the neighborhood of zoo degrees.� @CAPS1 setting-related issue for kurmaskie was the fact the area seemed deserted and he had to continue for mile until he was able to find a spot with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate.	3	2		3																					
152	3	The features of the setting keep affecting the cyclist because first its hopeful then he relizes its hopeless. He was laughting when people told him the right directions and now �It was sad, hopeless laught, mind you, but at least I still had energy to feel bad for self.� said the cyclist when he was refering back to the first town. The reason this affect the cyclist is at first he was going good then he got thirsty and bad things happened.  thats how it affect th cyclist.	1	1		1																					
156	3	Many features in the setting affect the cyclist. Several main features include the cars lading town. that aint really towns anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could give him water, but it was all run down and weakened. �I arrived at the first �town�. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.� He is saying that the town could�ve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed He tried to pump water but got no success. �I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldn�t cool down.� A working water pump would�ve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading	2	2		2																					
160	3	In �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the cyclists was effected by the features of the setting. She was first effected by the old men which told her a �shortcut� to her ride to Yosemite National Park. Then she was effected by a ghost towns which had no water to give her. Then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweed and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by. Then at the end she came upon �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� where she decided to make decisions herself. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way except �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� which saved her from dehydration.	2	2		2																					
172	3	In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions were from elder men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to decide which way to take when there was a fork in the road. He chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into flat roads that went to rolling hills, snakes blocking his path, and a dehydration state that could�ve killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
178	3	The feature�s of the setting affect the cyclist because, the cyclist is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he�s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn�t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. �Rough road ahead.�  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
179	3	The settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the �@CAPS1 town� he isn�t really warried he is kind of laughing and thinks his funny by saying.� This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time  - say, before the last world war.� Then after he says that it ways he chuckled. When he gets the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water he begins to switch into conservation made and begins to get is scared. He says.� I would comer  water- a test at my inner spirit � This showing that he was scared. After he sees the abanoned Grape juice factory he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind same expensive biking gear. This definatly shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction. When he finally reaches the balt shop he is releved and goes to the bathrom and drinks water. He  also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn�t have a rod. These examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
182	3	The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.� This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration.	2	1		2																					
192	3	The features in the setting are very effective to the cyclist. He is in a desert area of California and he has limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry. He barely had an water to drink and he had to go a long way in the hot and humid weather. The deficiency of water could have made him became dehydrated. Another obstacle that he had during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park was the hills that he faced. At the beginning, he was on flat terrain, now he has hills that he has to pedal up that makes it a lot harder for him. One other obstacle that he faced was the snake he ran into. That setting had many obstacles for this guy. If it wasn't for the heat and lack of water, he might have been able to make it a little easier.	1	1		1																					
195	3	Some features of the setting setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said �I wipe the sweat from my eyes.�	1	1		1																					
196	3	The setting had a huge affect on the cyclist. One affect was the lack of water in the area he was in, which was a dessert. Also, the lack of people in the area didn�t help the cyclist out at all. The hills on the road made it more tougher on the cyclist because it drashed what little energy he had left. Also, the sun beating down on him made his body more warm and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do.	1	2		2																					
197	3	"In the setting of � Rough road ahead: do non excee posted speed limit.� The cyclist is greatly affected. In the beginning the authour is enjoying a nice campground outside lodi California when �old-timers� told the cyclist directions and from his piont of view  ""they'd  sounded so sure of themselves when pointing off out land marks and spouting off towns  I would come to along this breezy aunt.� So the cyclist used that information and it wasn�t for   The Better."	1	1		1																					
200	3	In this essay, the features of the setting cause the cyclist to become irritaed toward the old men. Ten this essay, old men give the cyclist direction, and instead of using a map, he takes their advice. However their information is out of date, and takes the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist uses all of his energy to get to unknown towns of no importance, and with no water. The cyclist blame the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy. However he showed realy become himself for taking their advice, and motuising a credited map on real directions.	2	3		3																					
201	3	The setting of where you are riding has alot to do with the cyclist. In my own opinion I think the setting is the most important part.	2	2		2																					
204	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summer�s day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, �.I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.� (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except �Old timers who haven�t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing� (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor. It can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting.	2	3		3																					
210	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. one example is, the condition of his jar	0	0		0																					
215	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun. The heat dyhydrates and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor. It takes up the time and energy he has to preform. Another key ingreedient of the setting was the desert. There was no one to help him and there wasn't a place to get water. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story.	1	1		1																					
220	3	"On that long bike ride the cyclist was affected by the setting. He was affected of the lack water, the heat and the bad directions, throughout the story the cyclist ran out of water due to bad directions from some men.""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride.� I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men.� Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information. But not the land has changed and the directions were wrong. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help. The cyclist experienced how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal."	2	3		3																					
223	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is hot, therefore he gets thirsty. When he says �the sun was beating on me� this shows it was hot. Thats one of the reasons why he was tired and dehydrated.	1	2		2																					
240	3	There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town there wasn�t any real water he could drink. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty. Also, it�s the middle of June in California, it�s very hot and size and the is going to wear him out pretty quickly. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says �Over one long, crippling hill�, he�s saying the hills are very hard for him. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story.	2	1		2																					
251	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the authour was not and augsosted and as she was ridding her bike there was no place for her to stop and fill up her water bottle.	1	1		1																					
252	3	The rode was deserted there wasn�t a builing, car, or house in sight. He was stuck andhes in the middle of nowhere without any water or food, poisonous snakes and the heat could made him collapse.	1	1		1																					
253	3	"The cyclist on her trips sees a lot of features that would discourage her. She is riding in high desserts of california in June"" (kurmaskie). We all know desserts are steaming hot and dry especially in june. She also encounters hills (kurmaskie) to make matters wose she was travelling on hills in the extreme heat.Though the cyclist goes through many perilous obstacles she makes it to a camp a lives I could seethe horizon, telling myself that I could make it that par, I'd be fine.""(kurmaskie) This shows the author's dedication and that if you don tgive up you will be fine."	2	2		2																					
254	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� the setting is an all- important factor. The author feels the need to describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details each place he stops, such as in �one ramshackle shed�and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule�� and �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite�� In a story such as this setting is of great importance especially since it is so rapidly changing. The story itself would be of much different quality likely for a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past, this story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is.	1	1		1																					
258	3	The cyclist in the essay goes through phases that effect him differently according to the setting. At first the cyclist knows where he is and is very familiar with his location. He is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it. He then shows up at a �ghost town.� He begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him. This place was completely deserted and there was no water for him. He began to feel discouraged when he passed the Grape juice factory and he seriously believed this was the end for him. His hope and enjoyment finally returned to him after he saw the sign for the bait. The bikers feelings and attitude changed as often as the setting did.	2	2		2																					
259	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned �@PERSON1�s Grape Juice� factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets �old timers and the give him a �shortcut� to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their �shortcut.� While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. �It din�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.	2	2		2																					
260	3	The features can affect the cyclist very well or not. I depends on what condition happening. For example, he could fall. Does he have a traveling first aid kit.	0	0		0																					
261	3	Setting is a very important element to the story �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit: by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative, for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1 the story would not be as interesting.	3	0		2																					
267	3	"The features of the setting affect the cy clist in many ways. For example the lack of water was the biggest thing. Without cool water he had nothing to reboost his energy. He would get tired out faster. Even he does find water its hot, like when he says,� brakish water feeling some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This shows how in �the high desert of June,"" the water is all very hot. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes the water still wouldn�t cool down the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot. Also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it. We know the roads rough when he says, �large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. ""This also shows you couldn�t go fast."	3	2		3																					
268	3	The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes �that the old men would have been right,had he been riding,� before the last word war.� But any �town� he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says,�It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� @CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, But �hope was fading.� Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who haven�t moved from their front porches in years.	1	1		1																					
275	3	"When the cyclist takes off on the road again he has plenty of water, strongs legs and enjoys the sunny and warm day. But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and cough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence, as he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terain he says,"" i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the queruring that he says,"" i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�. This shows that by this time his confidecnce was lost because of the insane heat and unberable terrain. He begins to lose  his sanily along with his strength because the setting around him was so terrible."	2	3		3																					
279	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by how much confidence in where he�s going and how he�s gona get there. Having no water	1	1		1																					
282	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in @CAPS1 ways. The cyclist was in California in June weather. If it wasn�t so hot, he wouldn�t have needed water as badly. He wouldn�t have been sweating as much. Also, there weren�t any buildings or cars around, so there wasn�t anyone to help him. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.� @CAPS1 features of the setting could affect the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
287	3	"He setting made the cyclist feel lonely. The cyclist lost hope quickly because she was never saw any people or water on the way. The cyclist said they saw a �ghost town�. Before he got to the fish camp the cyclist saw no one and was becoming dehydrated. This caused him to lose hope and at some points he thought he was going to die. For example, he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It is clear that the setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way."	2	2		2																					
289	3	The setting of the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.� It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on �the sun was beginning to beat down� He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. �I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. �The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on.	2	3		3																					
292	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly in his determined ride. At first he seemed at case talking about the cool pines and rushing rivers he was going to encounter once getting to Yosemite. After a strenuous ride he started to get nervous and wonder if he was even going to survive. He was running out of water and he thought be a diamondback. Once he reached the rolling hills he saw a posted speed limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m.p.h. He was doing a ''water depleting 12 m.p.h. wonder how he was going to survive. At the end of the rolling hills he came to an old Welch�s grape factory wondering his life was so cruel. After that he was determined to survive and make it to his destination. He picked out spoke on horizon and rode to them makes his way across the desert. The finally made it to �Only and wilbers fish camp where he know he was safe and would survive.	2	3		3																					
296	3	"During the cyclist journey he was faced with many ?? ??. Mostly the driver ?? and out of water. In the essay it says how he arrived at the first town and was in search for water. It said ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way. "	1	1		1																					
297	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because of the bad conditions of the road and the not sun and the desserts and the low amount of energy supply he had left the reasons why  	1	1		1																					
298	3	As if along bike ride through the city isn�t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. �High deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good.	3	2		3																					
299	3	The features that affect the cyclist is the lack of water he slows. Another is the directions from the old men that probably aren�t up to date nowadays.	1	1		1																					
304	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, �Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven�t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. �This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se � a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
308	3	There were many features of the setting that affect he cyclist to make his difficut journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise. For example, �I followed their advice and launched out at first line, nd along a �short cut� that was toslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.� This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed @CAPS1, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate. For example, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death. For example �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June�� This is stating without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die.  	2	3		3																					
309	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting often affects the character. One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me�. This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was confused. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels @NUM1 degrees. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� That quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. ""@CAPS1 road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made the biker have to work harder, and use more energy. These conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination."	3	2		3																					
310	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,� affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was �traveling through the high desserts� which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, �trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.� From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into �A far like substance� The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
315	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie�s, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""This sentence from the text stores he is dehydrated, because of this it creates an obstacle he must face. Also, another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is, the rough road ahead he had to face. �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign I would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead. Luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well."	2	1		2																					
321	3	Whether the lack of water, the hills, the tumble weeds � all are things that affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water. The hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills. Finally is the tumbleweeds. The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look. When he sees tumble weeds he try�s to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn�t want to crash. The dehydration / lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive. When you are lack of water and energy it makes your goal more hard to complete.  	2	2		2																					
322	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, �I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved @NUM1). Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a �ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, �Telling myself that of I could make it that far, I�d be @NUM3). The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
326	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.	1	1		1																					
333	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert. The dessert is very hot. I know this because in the story, he states that it feels around @NUM1 degrees. He struggled for water but couldn�t find any that was cool. He found a water pump that had ""a tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This means it was hot and couldn�t find water."	2	2		2																					
342	3	@CAPS1   the  story  the  condition of  problem  often effected the mood of the cyclist . For  example when the sign said ,” Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.” @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated . The dry and hot climate began to become problem for the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
343	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he could have tried  if he drunk the battery taste water. or if he didn�t get enough clean water on time. Driving a bike on in a long distance, with no water or any other supples is very energy consuming. So you have to plan trips like that very wisly.  	1	1		1																					
345	3	The features of the setting afect the cyclist in many ways. If he wasn�t in �High deserts of California in June� he probaly wouldn�t be dehydrated if he was in @DATE1 it wouldn�t be so hot out. Also if there weren�t �short rolling hills� he would have had more energy. As you can see setting affects the cyclist a lot.	1	1		1																					
350	3	The features of the setting in the essay entitled �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist in an tagonizing manner. He is dehydrated and exhausted due to the conditions of the environment he was in. the cyclist became dehydrated because of not only a lack of water, but also the scorching heat of the desert. He sweat to much to the point that he lost an enormous amount of bodily fluids. The cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved. Therefore the cyclist became so exausted that he almost died. These are the ways the environment the cyclist was in affected him.	2	2		2																					
359	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist quite durastrely. First of all, he was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� He was running out of water and the pump he found only produced.� brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. �and� had the flavor of battery acid.� Then he came upon �rolling  hills� and �Rough @CAPS1.� By the end, he was exausted, dehidrated, and in desperate need of water. The turain made the story more meaning full in proving that you souldn�t get directions from old guys. 	2	2		2																					
380	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly was incorrect and he got lost. The lack of water led to the possibility to sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst. The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy.These were the affects the setting had to the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
386	3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He can�t say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him he�ll die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and that�s like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.	2	3		3																					
394	3	Winding hills limited water and poor directions are the troubles of this cyclist. First he gets very bad directions from a group of old men that have not been outside of their porch in awile, then he gos through the first town and does not fill is water bottles then he gets lost and runs out of water but finds a fishing store where there is water and people that give him a better map.	2	1		2																					
397	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist grate deal. For example, it was not and hill goet dehydrated. He went down this rusty-bumpy road, which didnt help his dehygration And another example would be he found a plane was he could set a change and find the best way to get where he was going. That the features on the setting affection the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
398	3	The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all he rides into barren land. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying �it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This was in response to the first �town� he came across. Next he speaks of a large snake that came close to him which is dangerous, but luckily he manuvers out of its way. But the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water. This is a threat to any living creature. But in the end he found some water and the story ended fine.	2	2		2																					
401	3	"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting are devastating to the cyclists condition. ""@CAPS1 through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over �short, rolling hills.� Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn�t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits �the traditional definition of a ghost town� and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path. This combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling, and almost pushing him to death."	3	2		3																					
404	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The reasons were the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water were cooled down offer he refilled it all the way up. My last reason is because of the rolling hills.	1	1		1																					
415	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by helping him get water for his thirst. And getting back on the road to go where ever he is trying to go at. But the only thing is that he didn�t never say anything about getting his bait for the fish. Also, cyclist was all so affected because he almost died from thirst and no road.	1	1		1																					
417	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way. Having desert rahas makes you want to just lay their and not try to go any further, because you don�t know where and end will be. As for grassy, flowery land its more of a sense rout, and makes you want to keep going and see many things. Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a chalange, and a good workout at the same time, the setting does affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
418	3	When the cyclist first recieves directions to Yosemite Park from the �old timers� he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.  	3	3		3																					
420	3	"In the story the cyclist is affect by many features of the desert. The main feature is the heat. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" He�s also running low on water,�The water bottles only contained & few tantalizing sips.� He�s faced by extrem heat and lack of water. He�s tired and has a long way to go. So far, all of the towns have been deserted. Finally he reaches a bait shop and his water and refills his water and promised to stick to the map in the future."	2	2		2																					
422	3	The terrain described in this essay add affect to the strugles of the cyclist. For example when the author says �their were no cars nor buildings in sight� that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere. Also it adds a lot of affect when he comes upon an abandond juice factory and he is so thirsty he puts stones in his mouth to gather saliva. Also when he finally finds water an �oldtimer� asks if he knows the best way to go.	2	2		2																					
430	3	In the case of thr cyclist in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,� the setting has an enormous affecton the biker. Preclaminatly, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he �had been nitting my water bottles pretty regularly. �@CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, for the demonsrtrating just how much he needed water. The wate in this pump, the owner said, was, �somewhere in the neighbar had of two hundred degrees. If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, �ghost town� infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; �there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn�t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lose and acne.	3	3		3																					
432	3	"In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first �town� that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist �chuckled and moved on�, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached �the fork of sorts� twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber�s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men�s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."	3	3		3																					
437	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, the high deserts of California affected him. Also, �Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change.� For example flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then after over coming that, �A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,� �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55. Last the author says, �Sometimes life can feelso cruel. In conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
439	3	In the essay intitled �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit� the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, �At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.� This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of �old-timers.� From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, �About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first �town�, a ghost town,� �The sun was beginning to heat down,� This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a �A Rough Road Ahead� sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood.	3	3		3																					
446	3	The features of the setting in this story, �Do not exceed Posted Speed limit,� affect the cyclist in a huge way. The cyclist was biking through California in a desert-like area. It can get very hot there,like the writer describes, �wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.� The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed.  	2	2		2																					
447	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist. �I maneuvered down the hill.� This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would hawe been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy. If there werent anyhills to get in his way.	2	1		2																					
449	3	"In the start story �Do not exceed speed limit,� time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of california in June. The fact that the story took place in June (and especially in a California desert) really is what caused the cyclist�s dehydration. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual. This heat cause the dehydration and the ""growing realization that I (the author)"	1	1		1																					
451	3	Don�t let anything stop you with your goals. Going to Yosemite National Park. Takes a status that would out home off side. Forty miles into the trys comes to a town. Got to a water station and get nothing because old men say �the water taste like buttery acid. Lead going to hills and azyl towns, @CAPS1 can be rod without anything to drink. People die  from heatatacks because they don�t  sits and take herats for water and food.	1	1		1																					
454	3	Each person has a really good ability that stands out. Someone can be good looking, smart or confident. Someone @MONTH1 never give up and do what he wishes to do. The cyclist in the story is or man with a strong will. He wants to be alive. He saw too many difficult in his way to get the place he wanted to be. He listened to some old guys and he lost his way. The sun was beginning to beat down. He was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal. He was losing his strength. The weather  was @NUM1�@CAPS1.The  water  tasted  like  acid battery. He  believed  himself  that he can be alive. He got stronger by believing in himself eventhough he was losing strength. Every place that he passed by was a new experienced for life. They were like a game that he came successful. He never give up. He did everything he could do to not losing his mind. He didn�t want lose the battle in his mind.   	2	3		3																					
456	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us ��I was travelling through the high deserts of California  in June.� The extreme heat of the summer definitely put a  strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water . Unfortonatly the  �towns� were very far apart and many not having good water making dehydration  problem. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.� @CAPS1 of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map.	2	2		2																					
458	3	The features of the setting been amajor affect of this cyclist  in the  story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but think is a lot like and winding. The cyclist also comes across bumps, non-paved roads that make it hard to meneuver through. Then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story.         	2	1		2																					
461	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by that he or she should behave act or talk according to the settings. It means that where ever they are existing and whatever it looks like, they need to fit them self in. They also need to fit the mood according to where they are located. The cyclist is feeling comfortable according to the story and he dosent need any change in setting or location. For conclusion the features of the setting affects the cyclist by that he needs to make improvment and changes according to where he or she is located. 	1	1		1																					
463	3	"In the story �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist, it say this because the cyclist enables us of what is going around him and he feels about it. It says, �one ramshack shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule greated me. The author goes on to say that it troubled him. Actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town. The unplanned that the roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55 mph since he barely had any water he was going 12 mph. This tells me, he�s troubled and confused about the surrounding ways, because it all desert seem light it became the author is slowly loosing hope on the travels further and further. I think it�s the same week people that as soon as trouble comes; or looks like it�s among they start losing hope and their better judgment, and life seems a lot harder."	3	2		3																					
464	3	In this story it seems as if everything is dry. The rider would be getting real thirsty. He is all by himself that would make any man feel strong, because if you have an ascedent that nobody would be there to help. Hes going up and down steep hills so he would have to be careful.	1	1		1																					
466	3	The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men�s �town� was now abandoned. ��(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled�� This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When �a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a �sad, hopeless laugh.� The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water.	3	3		3																					
469	3	FLAT ROADS, HILLS, BUILDING - ALL ARE SETTINGS THAT AFFECTED THE CYCLIST. WHILE THE HILLS WERE FLAT THE CYCLIST WAS DETERMINED HE COULD MAKE IT AND WASN�T GOING TO GIVE UP ON HIMSELF. WHEN THE HILLS GOT BIGGER AND HARDER TO PEDAI, HE BEGAN TO GET EXHAUSTED AND TIRED. LASTLY, THE BUILDINGS WERE WHAT MADE HIM WANT TO GIVE UP. WHEN HE SEES THE BUILDING OF THE WELCH�S GRAPE JUICE FACTORY AND THE YOUNG BOY DRINKING HE �HUNG HIS HEAD.� HE WAS GETTING MORE TIRED AS HE WENT ALONG. THE LAND WAS MAKING HIM FEEL AS IF HE DIDN�T WANT TO KEEP MOVING ALONG.	2	2		2																					
485	3	Many things on the cyclist journey affected him. It was in the middle of summer in California. The heat is unbeleivable and rediculously hot. �� I could drop from heatstroke�� he was so bad overheated and dyhdrated that he could of died any minute. He could have also been killed by a giant snake. ��look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement�� It could have easily killed him, if he wasn�t careful. But with his determination and spite he pulled threw and made it to a fresh supply of water. If he would have gaven up his life would have been over.	3	3		3																					
486	3	When the cyclist went to ask about the road the old men told him all its good way that he should go. But the old man hasn�t seen the land in a really long time. The man don�t long that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends ?? the cyclist didn�t know what to do.  	1	1		1																					
492	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him� no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclution of the setting, having only seen �One ramshackle shed in many miles, the cyclist almost looses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of �the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.� That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope.	2	2		2																					
495	3	There are many features in the setting that affect the cycleist, one of which is that he is in the middle of California riding his bike in the sun with a limited ammount of water. It affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
499	3	On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their direction aren�t so good. The desserted place affected him because there was no where for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. There were rusted water pump�s, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration.	2	2		2																					
505	3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement �I was travelling through the high deserts of California.� not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement �I was travelling in June.� @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, �blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also �had the flavor of battery acid.� This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he �had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.� The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink.	3	3		3																					
506	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with �His name written over them�. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. �That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map.	3	3		3																					
509	3	In the selection �Do not exceed posted speed limit� there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn�t been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and �crippling hills,� according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn�t empty and deserted.	2	3		3																					
511	3	The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn�t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay.	2	2		2																					
513	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welch�s Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,� describes the cyclist, �but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the �shortcut.� �Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,� reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, � By the looks of it- had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory.� The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.  	3	3		3																					
514	3	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts olwing the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water decive his trip, but he was mistaken. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The setting affected the cyclist�s mood in a negative way.  	2	2		2																					
515	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. It stated, �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was  pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along. Also it stated,� At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down. There was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy.	2	2		2																					
516	3	Many things caneffect a cyclist and how they ride, in this essay many things effected him such as the setting of the story. One of the problems of the setting was there were no stores or even people, another and most important thing was the lack of water around him, so many things can effect a cyclist while They are riding inculding there suriondings.	2	3		3																					
517	3	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay �A sea worry �, because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says �my son body-surfs. He says it�s his �job�. That quote was explaining that he�s a body-surfer & it�s his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph.	1	2		2																					
523	3	The setting of the place was �ghost town� as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldn�t ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of new world because they told him the wrong directions.	1	1		1																					
525	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe @PERSON1 it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the problems he faced. For example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story it said �Drop from heatstroke.� this shows the setting affected him in a negative way, in the story heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character.	2	1		2																					
528	3	The setting affects alot in a cyclist. For example if you are in a city you seel rush tired and everweled. But in a forest you are happy and a bit less stress. A setting sets the mode also the attude in the story.	1	1		1																					
538	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn�t prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the �high deserts of colifornia in June� I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a �ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back� That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to �ease post� it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was �replaced by short, rolling hills� which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?"	3	3		3																					
539	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike the roads also would make him work harder.	1	1		1																					
540	3	The features of the setting affected the cycalist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didn�t know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
541	3	First the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem. That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn�t trust the guy. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desteart road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn�t attack him. Finally the biker faced his  las long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water.	2	2		2																					
545	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat in �the high deserts of California in June. The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds rattle snakes and ghost towns. All of these make the cyclist start to give up hope. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally.	2	2		2																					
547	3	The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.	2	2		2																					
549	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. In the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. Also because he was in the desert he had no sense of direction. Also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn�t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water.	2	2		2																					
550	3	"The setting really afeted the cyclist alot.The sun and hot weather dehidrated him. He also had pretty much ran out of water. In the story he says ""The bottles contained only a few drops this shows that he had drank almost all of his water. Then it says ""the growing relization that I could drop from a leaf stroke"" shows the heat was affecting him."	2	2		2																					
553	3	I read �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� written by Joe Kurmaskie in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by accepting advice from �old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches @CAPS1 was in office�	1	1		1																					
555	3	The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist. For example.� I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� The deserts of California especially in June are hot and dry and caused the cyclist to use much of his water supply, very quickly. As he �toiled� on, the terrain features became even more trying,� over one long, crippling hill��By this time the cyclist barely had enough energy to make it over a hill from all the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting.	2	2		2																					
559	3	The features of the setting affect the setting affect the cyclist by. Dehydrating him due to the heat and lack of water and to see mirages. And he loses strength going over the many hills. And there is a very large snake he has to ride by that could have bitten him.	1	1		1																					
569	3	He�s on a very hot climate, in a desert, so he needs lots of water, but he has a limited supply. He�s riding on hills, which makes it even harder. He can�t find any towns that aren�t abandoned.	2	2		2																					
571	3	There were several features of the setting that held an affect on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert. This condition normally prevents one from obtaining water. Seeing as how water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack there at due to the desert created the conflict of dehydration. Additionally, the town that was abandoned triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclist�s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope. By the time he/she reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now his head is screaming with annoyance and his body is screaming with lack of water. This abandoned juice factory almost completely wiped out the cyclist hope. A man is little to nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative affect on him. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her desperation of survival, an instinct in all of us. In conclusion, the desert removed water and the abandoned homes and factory removed hope and all three created a negative affect. The cyclist is lucky to have survived. 	1	1		1																					
583	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot, him not having anything to drink, nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages. In the essay it states, �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.� This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding enviroment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasen�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. �The cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one.	2	2		2																					
585	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the �high desserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. �I could drop from a heatstroke,� he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist�s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. �Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact.	3	3		3																					
588	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the �town� The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, ��I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, �Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp�� (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   	3	2		3																					
591	3	In the cyclist�s outlook on his journey through Yosemite�s park, reader�s can get a good feel of how it might be to be riding right along side. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride. He sees such a vast variety of scenery including rivers, sandy dry deserts also, as well as cool pines and trees in the park part. He said it was also breezy which probably made for an enjoyable temperature.	1	1		1																					
593	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. �I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.� All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.	2	2		2																					
595	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways, first is that it is very hot in the desert. Second is that there aren�t many towns out there. Finally is that water is hard to find out there, so if he get thirsty it would be hard to get more water if you didn�t find a town.	1	1		1																					
596	3	The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the dessert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1. In conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which affects his entire journey.	3	2		3																					
597	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren�t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat.	2	2		2																					
603	3	"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
606	3	I guess really sofcty comes first, and you have to be cautious when yay out in the streets on a bicycle. I really don�t understand much, so I can�t write much.	0	0		0																					
611	3	The feature of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. He was a California desert in the month of June. There was no water in the desert so he had to use the water he had. He says the sun began taking harder ran and the terrain turned into short rolling hills. The hills made him work harder which dehydrate him guccher.and since there was no water in the desert, he could have died of dehydration	2	2		2																					
614	3	The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� Affect the cyclist in many ways. First in the essay when the @CAPS1 says he is in the deserts of California, that can affect because it gives them an idea of how hot it most likely was out there and how lack of water can really harm someone. Also when the @CAPS1 describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply.	2	2		2																					
616	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because. It was a lack of the water and he was in the high deserts or California .For example in the text stated �when I tried a drop or two, it  had the flovor of battery acid. That showed clearly when he tried to get water from a pump what it clearly came out as the settling was extremely hot and made the cyclist misreable in such ways.	1	1		1																					
623	3	The features from the essay affect the cyclist in many was because he is getting field, and is drinking more and more water. The raods are getting rough so he needs to slow down. If he slows down he will get tierd and need more water although he is all out on top of that the old men really didnt know what they were talking about the features affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
627	3	The cyclist has to over come a lot of obstacles. For example, there is a snake in his path, so he cationly rides around it. Also, there are alot of hills and he wasn�t sure if he could make it up those hills. Furthermore, he is almost out of water so he could die of heatstroke or dehidration. In conclusion he over comes these obsticles and achieves his goal. 	2	1		2																					
630	3	Blazing tempitures, lack of water, dwinding hope-all are the parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. Blazing tempitures, because the hotter the water was the more perspiration and lack of hydration was appointment you can�t put anything back in your skin and your body can�t function without water finally dwinding . Hope, the cyclist didn�t think he was going to live through this. He tried hard and pushed himself and success was made. He lived.	2	2		2																					
641	3	The features affects the setting of the cyclist because in some ways they through you off a little with others lines and then will get confused of what their acually talking about. The littlest thing that could through you off is the line when it says before the last world war. That kind off through me off alittle.	1	1		1																					
643	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldn�t find any building or water for many miles. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didn�t know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
644	3	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again.	2	2		2																					
645	3	"The features of the setting make him happy because he meets some people that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip. This is what the text says, �what I shouldn�t have done was let them have a peck at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a �shortcut� that was to slice away hours from my ride."" He also talks about not talking directions from old timers. This is when the text says,�"	1	1		1																					
646	3	During the cyclist journey to Yosemite many things got in his way and slowed him down. For example, he listened to the old men who gave him wrong directions to where he wanted to go. Also, his water supply was getting low which drained his energy alot quicker than usual. The heat also played a part of his energy loss. The heat made him sweat perfusely which made the water that was in his body be of no use.    	2	1		2																					
650	3	At first the trip was easy going and flat. It was a nice day out and the water sapply was draining. Soon, the path became hills and soon got rough. Even though the pines gave shade it wasn�t enough to help the cyclist. Eventually he reached some what civilization after enduring a grueling climb and by cycle trip through the woods.	1	1		1																					
654	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.   "	3	3		3																					
655	3	Well the features of the setting affects the cyclist is a lot of ways. Well when his water was is hot to drink He got some pebbles and stuck them, in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that it will dilute your spit. The terrain of the story was very rocky and hilly. Those are the features of the terrain.	1	1		1																					
656	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The hills afected the cyclist because they would be harder for him to ride The abandoned town also affected him. When he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break but when he got there the town was abandoned. Also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on. Also there was nowhere that he could get water around him. Many features of the setting affected him.	2	2		2																					
662	3	I would think even riding a bike for so long can be bad for the behind. But also good exercising especially for the legs all the strength you get from the muscle. To know where you going could take forever. But I do know what they would have to face all types of weather, but as long as you have gear on no harm could come to you.	1	1		1																					
664	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, �Sometimes life can be so cruel�. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He�s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
672	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all he is travelling through a desert in California in June so the weather is extremely hot and the cyclist needs water, however as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water himself so he is thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, if frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot it tastes like battery acid @CAPS1, when the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, but there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, that the cyclist cannot go more that 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town. he still will have to wait longer for the much needed water, travelling at 12 mph. The snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape. Thus his major concern is the lack of water.	3	3		3																					
674	3	"The features of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when it says, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.� The features of this setting are making the cyclist determined. Another example, is when it says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" The features of the setting are making him brave and couragious. The last example is when it says, �I hung my head.� The features of this setting are making the cyclist have despair. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
677	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by rush he /she got when speeding down the hill. The fresh morning air, no limits just you and your feet. Speeding, going as fast as you can with your heart pounding in your chest. No boundarys, when you can go where you like, when you like. No people to get in the way of you and your need for speed.	0	0		0																					
681	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed Limit,� is about a man that follows some bad directions and in the middle of a desert is stuck without water. He starts to lack confidence in the directions when the setting changes. He said, �After fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.� He had been told this was a thriving town but was left with nothing. This was a big let down and the cyclist wasn�t so positive this had been the right choice. He keeps on riding and finds another dissetling sight.� One ramshacle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that wouldn�t  hold in the lamest of mule greeted me.� @CAPS1 was another place said to be good but all he got was battery flavored water. On the last strech of his bike met with rough rolling hills, a diamondback looking snake, and an abandoned juice factory. All of this brang his spirits lower and lower until he thought he would die. The cyclist ended up finding a store but he was discauraged by the environment he was in a hot and could have died.	1	1		1																					
682	3	In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,�The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.� In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I�d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.� This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn�t care if he died. From the author�s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
688	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuious setting to have to bike with. I would never be able to do what he did.	1	1		1																					
689	3	The cyclist had alot of problems with his setting. It was very hot and he started getting low on water. This caused him to become dehydrated. There was hardly any civilization so no one could come to his aid. Also, the path he decided to take was long and vigorous.	1	1		1																					
692	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� By Joe Kurmaskie the settings affected the cyclist by how hard his ride is. When the road was smooth He ride was fast when it was the hills it took him longer to get to the next town.	1	1		1																					
693	3	Varias faetures of the setting affect the journey and mooble if the cyclist in the text. The first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the desert. He is �traveling through the high deserts of California in June� , and this is making him really thirsty. �[He] had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly �because of this. He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless. He becomes hopelee because there is no building or establishments anywere in sight. Therefore no water and there isn�t a place to get any water. Another feature of the setting that affects him is the people that gave him directions. They told him abait a shoutcut, and he listened. This through everything off, and he was left with despair. Another feature is the Gary and Wilber�s fish camp.This lead him to sicocss of finding water. This affected his mood because he had hope again. In conlusio, many of the features of the setting affected his mood in many ways.	2	3		3																					
698	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he had some troubles, the fact that there was not much civilization affected the cyclist because he was not able to refill his water bottles, so he grew very thirsty. Also, the many hills and the fact that it is summer impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast. When it says, �A tar like substance oozed out Wouldn�t cool down,� it showed how he wasn�t able to drink. Also, when he passed the grape juice factory, it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty. If he hadn�t taken the advice of the men in the first place he would have had a much shorter ride and would not have been so exhausted. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay.	3	3		3																					
699	3	The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? � It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�� The heat must have been bad, he wasn�t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men �helping� with directions.	2	2		2																					
702	3	The cyclit of �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was �@NUM1 degers�. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would�ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story.	2	2		2																					
706	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was very hot and he didn�t have any more water also, there aren�t any towns that had good water in them, until he eventually arrived at this fishing comp. Due to his lack of water, he became dehydrated and really weak. �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� this quote shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and losing his energy.	1	2		2																					
711	3	Many features of the carlifonian desert influenced the cyclist during his ride.Ghost towns, rolling hills, and dangerous snakes influenced the cyclists experience during the''shortcut'' to yosenite.The Ghost towns along the journey syndized the world desrting him during his ride by offering no help with water supply as a place to cool dowdn.The road sign warning of rough terrain was another barrier on his bike ride that he had to get through in dehydration to reach his goal,yosenite.The diamondback rattlesnate caused additional horror to the cyclist's'' ride from hell''.He had to manuever around the serpent while unstable from dehydration.All features of the cyclist's riding setting affected his ride to yosenite.	3	2		3																					
714	3	"The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affects the cyclist in many ways. First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men who�s directions were out of date. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways. "	2	2		2																					
715	3	The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he�s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he�s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that there�s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved.	3	3		3																					
716	3	The setting affected the cyclist by the people from Lodi get him into the wrong way and he had to survive from there so he that was very dry and No water or nothing to the next stop was at the bait store so he was determined to get to next stop destination by he did want to give up own but the guy ask him did he want direction he said he was not going to be fooled twice.	1	1		1																					
720	3	"The setting affect is used to a great extent in the short story �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� The cycleist had beed going for a very long time when he came to the first town and there was no water At this point you can tell that he has lost confidence the �old timers"" directions. From this quote; �a ton-like substance oozed out.� This quote shows how after @NUM1 miles of pedaling when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point his one chance of water had been depleated. The next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out. He said, �I hung my head� this shows how he almost completely lost all hope and that he was sure that he is going to die."	3	3		3																					
722	3	During the cyclist�s biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town This sight doesn�t immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain. Eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief. As evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence.	3	2		3																					
725	3	The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him. Also the change from �Flat read�, (Kurmaskie) to �short, rolling hills� (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster. This is how the features in the setting affected the author of the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.�	2	2		2																					
727	3	The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront  nature. when he began his trip with advice from �old coggers� he � rode out with strong legs and a smile.� As he came to the first town, he describes it as a �ghost town� having no water and no human contact for some time. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rods on. Through the miles he incountered a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps, snakes,and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his �inner spirit� and caused his dehydration to further. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation.	2	2		2																					
732	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldn�t get water from anywhere because he was in a dessert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty camps. Second, there were short rolling hills, and rough roads which made it hard to ride on. There were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes. The heat made it hard to keep riding. And there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
736	3	The setting effects the cyclist very much. By the very dry climates	2	2		2																					
737	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead� plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn�t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see�s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn�t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. �Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.� @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her."	3	3		3																					
741	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. They make it hard to concentrate, because its heat, they make it unbearable. The setting has the affect of drowsiness and thirst, �Dry bitter lnad, longing, longing.	1	1		1																					
743	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The man was riding a bike through rough lands. His adventure wouldn�t of been an adventure if he was just riding his bike an flat smooth element. The fact that the hills were steep, rocky and many hills is what made his bike ride what it was.	1	1		1																					
747	3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly effected by his surroundings. First, he described a beating sun and pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent. The setting is active just like the cyclist. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad souding corral. When these old, forsaken things one mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair. And to tap that off, he drinks water that tastes like �battery acid.� Battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
751	3	When the cyclist is in the �serenity of an early sunset evening�, the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good. Next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water. On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly.	2	2		2																					
763	3	In  the   cyclist   story  the  setting   took  a  huge  roll on  how  the  story    thined   out.The  water  had  a lot  of  effects  on  the  cyclist.The  setting  of the story  took  place  in  the  high  deserts of  california   in  june.As  soon  as  you  read   that  you  now  something  is  wrong.In   the  story  he say  ,the  sun  was  beginning    to  beat  down .This  is going  to  affect  him because  hes  riding  through the desert on  a  bike,which  causes  him  to  become  dehydrated .I  eased  past,trying  to  keep my  balance  in  my dehydrated  state.Thes begining   to  lose  his  mind  because  he  has  no water  because   of  the  setting.Everything  about  the setting  causes  the  cyclist  some  problems.The  heat ,the   setting ,the  lack  of  water  almost  causes him his  life.    	2	1		2																					
764	3	The setting affects the cyclist in alot of ways. The first way is that he was riding in the middle of a desert in June. If he was riding  in @LOCATION1, it woudn't be painfully hot. Also, the rolling hills probablly didnt help If it was mostly down hill, he would have been fine. Riding a bike up a hill when your tired is near impossible.	1	1		1																					
767	3	The feature of the setting is making the cyclist frustrated, thirsty, and confused. The features are making him frustrated by he thought he was going the right way where he really was going out.	1	1		1																					
775	3	The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June traveling back rodes, with no place to stop for water, if the cyclist would have followed the path they intended on following the ride probably have been more enjoyable and he/she wouldn�t of had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water, they would have been fine.	1	1		1																					
777	3	The main features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the fact that it was June and the dessert heat. �� I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�.� (kurmaskie @NUM1). This helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of California dessert. This affected the cyclist by his dehydration and the fact that he was inthe middle of no where with no one to help him. This is how the month of June and the dessert heat affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
778	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that said �Rough Road Ahead� he was already low on water, but that made things much worse. The rough road made it harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working harder and getting thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some pebbles on the ground and shoved them in his mouth. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate�. Lastly, �GARY AND WILBER�S FISH CAMP�, could possibly have saved the cyclist�s life. He stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear. The setting and features severly affected the cyclist throughout his journey.  	2	2		2																					
780	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they don�t ride as much anymore and don�t know the best routes to take. So they just take their old routes, thinking they are still the better way, but when they use them they realize how tiring and bad they are.	1	1		1																					
783	3	In the short story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� by @PERSON1, a cyclist travels through an extreme climate and tough terrain that nearly end his life to get to his destination. After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first �town� the locals said he�d find is deserted. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has �the flavor of battery acid.� With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June�, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� @CAPS1 tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a �water-depleting @NUM3.� eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, knowing now to strike out on better days and better directions.	2	3		3																					
786	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist�s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he @MONTH1 not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let  down for the cyclist�s mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned.	2	3		3																					
794	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
797	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in �ghost towns�, there is no-one to ask directions from or to just talk to. Also, some pumped water from water pumps tastes like �battery acid� and could most likely make some one sick. Also, there are poisonous snakes and other dangerous animals.	1	1		1																					
798	3	"There are many features in the story, ""that affect the roles, like out of waters, bad directions. The narrator is ??? and says, ""the water bottles container a few tantalizing sips..� it is say that there is hardly any water left , and he still have to keep going on, until he can find some In the story water is something he has to over come because he is out of it by the time he gets to the fish store."	1	1		1																					
799	3	In this @ORGANIZATION1 I will explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the short story �Rough Road A Head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� The whole ordeal occurs in the �high deserts of california.� @CAPS1 to the text the cyclist had taken �out of date� direction from elderly people who thought they new the way. The cyclist encountered a snake, ghost town ad shutdown factory. Most of the time the cyclist was going over.	1	1		1																					
803	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the features is just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it. The cyclist gives you what you want and need to know so the affect would be about time the feature is finish play in noone would want to see the cyclist.	0	0		0																					
804	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting of a story is the background, place, and time the story took place. In the story, a cyclist needs to get to @CAPS1 Park. He stops and gets direction from a group of old men, who aren�t up with the times, and the cyclist gets lost. He faces drought, a snake, and being lost in the desert, the cyclist says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like a diamond back � blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, to"	1	2		2																					
808	3	The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe.	2	1		2																					
813	3	The setting affect the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay. The mood of the essay I think is a sort of dry summer day, the sort of �oh my gosh, its really hot,� type thing. The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, tumble weeds and more to contribut to the hopeless feeling. Although he was secured, and didn�t die, it seemed like he would surely not make it judging by the lack of water, scorching hot sun, and distance, with enduring these conditions. So the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him.	2	2		2																					
826	3	The features of a setting could be a number of different things. It could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, breezy and humid. The features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. The setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. In the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. These have been what I believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist.	2	3		3																					
831	3	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappoint, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally when he passes a portrin the road with nothing but a �ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral�� he becomes disturbed.  The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, �doing a water-deleting @NUM1.� The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, �ironic twist� the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist.	3	2		3																					
835	3	Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a group of old guys and ends up lost on rough road with no water, or relylittic supply of flat road was replaced by short rolling hills large highways lon jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� The rough road made have to work harder want more water and just made things tougher more than what they already were.	2	2		2																					
839	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point.	3	2		3																					
840	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The bumpy roads. Sand in the eyes, thirst hit him too hot and humid tempures. Maybe he got tired of pedaling had to walk. A wild dog chased him went he got in town. Had no money to buy a drink	1	1		1																					
843	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he�s fine. �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them� (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn�t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, �It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� he knows that things are going to get rough, because �the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph�. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn�t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, �tumble weeds crossed my path.� The landscape seems to get more threatening too, �a ridiculously large shake.� The landscape changes with the state of water."	3	3		3																					
856	3	The setting is mid summer in California in the desert. It is hot, humid and very dry. There is a lack of water in his bag. He is on a trip, going down the lost, rough and rigorous roads.	1	1		1																					
863	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. The speed limit sign makes him feel like life is cruel. His first glimpse of the welch's Juice factory makes him feel excited. Meeting the deserted fork in the road makes him feel troubled. When he finally gets there, he feels relieved. These are all examples showing that features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
864	3	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist & his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,�and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place. Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert. that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced.	1	1		1																					
867	3	Many features of the cyclist�s surroundings effect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor cycles, or even buildings. It�s like he�s on the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won�t hit any thing. The fact that he�s alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident.	1	1		1																					
869	3	this story is set in the hot in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote �about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first �town�. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one time�. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone.	2	2		2																					
871	3	Hot, terrain, middle of nowhere- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the hot weather in California made the cyclist thirsty and almost dehydrated. There was no place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad and warm. Second, the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere. He couldn�t get water to hydrate himself or to sit down and rest.	2	1		2																					
872	3	The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one. He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long  in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the author�s terrain. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I don�t have to bike in that terrain.  	2	1		2																					
873	3	The cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1� was riding through the California dessert in June. This dry, bare setting made it impossible to find any source of water. The only time that this cyclist found water was when it @NUM1 and tasting of battery acid. There was nowhere for him to find water for miles. This lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily. He even says that he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone. By taking the advise of the old men and taking a �short cut�, the cyclist past through ghost towns with no water. This �short cut� prolonged his trip, most likely by hours If he had gone through populated area despite the fact that it is a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would allow him to go faster. The dry, hot setting of the old men�s �short cut� made this cyclist�s trip last much longer than nessiarry.	3	2		3																					
880	3	The settings and features are very important to cyclists one because water and food try might carry a waterbottle and a snack but they need to know  where they are going and if they will need to bring extra or not. In the story I just read he didn�t bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble. Its important that a cyclist knows where their going and whats around them so they don't get lost and have no acsess to food or water.	2	1		2																					
887	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the �high deserts of California�, making a hint that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he must�ve been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the sun beating down on him. Second, he began to ride through hills, and as common sense would be used, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle especially up hill, and it wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water must�ve tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water. As you can tell, the difference in setting plays it�s crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply.	2	2		2																					
888	3	The setting affects the cyclists because he can not take the heat. His water supply is running how and he is dehydrated. It says this when the characters says. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide wings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from head strok� This is saying he is afraid he might pass out and die before he finds more water.	2	1		2																					
890	3	"It is my hot so the cyclist is very dehydrated, tired and lack of water. �I checked my water supply and heated on� is a good example oF this. There is also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around this bars the cyclists hope of finding civilization. Also not seeing any building and when he sees are it being deserted makes this very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he @CAPS1 the pump that has tar, dirt, then hot water in it. Also the road plays a toll on him. I know this house he says �If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill I�ll be alright"".This is how I know the setting and features in the setting is affecting the cyclists mentally and physically."	1	1		1																					
891	3	Hot, alone, no water � all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is very hot as the cyclist is riding. This makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated. The cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight. If anything happened to him there is no one to help. The cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy. With very little water it is hard to stay hydrated. Hot, alone, no water- all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
895	3	The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water. He did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him. Being in that situation and setting I would have given up.	2	2		2																					
896	3	When cycling it�s important to make yourself aware of the type of terrain it is, make sure of the weather, make sure of the environment, and most importantly make sure of your resources. These things are key before taking any cycling trip. They are very important in determining the type of trip you will have and enjoyable and relaxing trip, or a long and miserable trip.  	1	1		1																					
901	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way. For example, A tarlike substance oozed followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This affects him because cant get water from the well. So this means he needs water, but cannot get water. Also in the essay it says the terrain is bad so that means that the cyclist has to pedal harder to keep moving and he has to work harder to hot reek. So all this puts affect on him from just whats around him. The old abbandon factory with the boy drinking juice was had the  most effect on the cyclist because he was so thirsty and that was when he was about to give up. In this essay the setting had alot of affect on the cyclist to were he thought he might die."	2	2		2																					
911	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist mood and behavior. First the cyclist sees from believing the shortcut will help him arrive to Yosemite faster then he relies it wont. Next, the harsh sun and rafh terrain and lack of water causes the cyclist to give up hope that he will make it to yosemite and causes him to rethink his judgement and taking advice from others.	1	2		2																					
916	3	In the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy torns. Also, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people which made him fell alone and life he was going to die. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story �Over onelong, crippling hill a building came into view! This quote shows how the hills in the seting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
923	3	In the essay the setting had every thing to do with  the cyclist cause he is ridding through the desert with batey tay water. He is pedaling through the dry heat thats tough even you had water pluse there were hills deadly snakes.Its dangerous enough with out that stuff being there. So I would listen to the cyclist & never ever listen to old men.	1	1		1																					
924	3	On the cyclists rideto Yosemite National Park he encouters a lot of hardships due to the setting hes around and the advice given by oldmen. The cyclist riding his bike in the middle of June in the deserts of california isnt good to begin with adding to cyclist dehydration state. He first come to encouters ''one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn`t hold in the lament mule'' By that description oF his lecatracy it seems as if he might be in ghost town by himself almost could strand him. He described the terrain with �short, rolling hils.'' and ''over one long, crippling hill.'' This shows some of the obstacle that he had to go through in a bike, just to get to Yosemite National Park. He @CAPS1 realized once he encounterd these Features oF the terrain that he was oFF track and needed to find help. After his survival of his surroundings For as long as he could go, @CAPS1 gets help at a real camp. That is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist epidemic.	2	2		2																					
929	3	In my opinion the features of the selling affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he was talking abut the terair changing from long strat roads to shard winday one and the speed limit changing he said.he was doing a waterdepleting @NUM1 fuier sands like he is having a hard time, or doesn'twnt to go on.	1	1		1																					
937	3	In the essay �Rough road ahead: do not exeed posted speed limit,� the author is continually depressed, by the features of the landscape he passes. At first he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water, this sight doesn�t bothe him. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a �rusted water pump,� and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path then he passes an abandoned Welch�s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. The setting its features serve to dissappoint depress the cyclist in his quest to find water.	3	2		3																					
943	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, because there was no one in sight he couldn�t ask for any help or direction. Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didn�t help him it just tired him more. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have biten him and then he wouldn�t be able to make it anywhere because of the bite. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
946	3	�Do not Exceed the posted speed limit� tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of �the serenity of an early summer evening,� and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the �town� he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclist�s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.	3	3		3																					
949	3	The setting in the essay �Rough Road ahead; Do not Exceed the speed limit� affected the narrator in many ways. The first thing that affected his ride was the heat. at first he didnt really notice but then it began to slow him down. Then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride, the roads went from flat sheet to short, rolling hills.� The road change and the heat made him say �I could drop from heatstroke.� Then because of the old towns he went through he was unable to get water. The water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality.	2	2		2																					
950	3	The complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story. His trip goes from bad to worse as he progresses to Yosemite. After taking directions from the �old codgers,� the author attempts the shortcut, but is dissapointed. He arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted. He rubbed it off though, and kept �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,� as his motivation. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued. Just as if things couldn�t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope. He became even more of a pessimist when �a ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavement�� He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned. He even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration. When he finally found the fish camp, he was relieved. All the obstacles he prospered through were worth in the end.	2	1		2																					
951	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in �Do not exceed posted speed limit� had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist�s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. �It didn�t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.	2	3		3																					
955	3	The features of the setting in the essay affected he cyclist because first of all he lisined to old fowks that hav�nt left their front porch in about ten years. Then he didn�t ask someone elses apirean on where to go and how to get there. His worsed mistake tough was not trusting the map he had with him the howl time. If he would have just trusted his map and not when with when the old fella said he wouldint have almost died of heat stroke.	2	1		2																					
967	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if the old men didnt give the boy advice then he probably wouldnt have run into all the trouble he ran into. At the same time the boy made his way to were he was going. Next time though he will just use his map so he dont have to go through the scare of death again.	1	1		1																					
968	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by the road�s condition being rough as the cyclist rides further along the road.	1	1		1																					
969	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a �run-down� rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.	3	3		3																					
975	3	The feature of the setting included nice cool pines and than a gost town and it bein hot out and banser of @CAPS1 and posine snacks and hills that where getting harder to go up. When he first started the pines where nice and cool but when he scan the gost town he sot dischriced than it started to set hot and than he seen the snack and thout that it was a dimed baby and was nuvves and than he was carid of dehydration than the hills started to make it harder and harder that is what it was like.	2	2		2																					
976	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water. When he coudnt.	1	2		2																					
979	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was died tried he/she didn�t have anything to drink. The essay stated how would say she/he would save the water til the end. He /she was so tired so the lack of water really affect him/her. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions.	2	2		2																					
981	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more.� I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldn�t find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit�, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
982	3	He feels alone there is noune around him to push him, and yet he keeps going trying to push him self to the end to win. The fast roads are rough and the hills are tall but he is a determined to finish.	1	1		1																					
983	3	Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no.	1	2		2																					
985	3	The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time. Destined to reach yosemite national park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening strongly. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture. next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted�. With what I believed to be my last burst of enery, I manevuered down the hill�. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replerilshed with confidence he had before when he �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile�	3	2		3																					
988	3	The author�s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist�s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he�s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person�s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.	3	2		3																					
991	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. �I noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling @NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
993	3	The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others. As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat. In one sentence the effect of the heat were clearly described by the cyclist	1	1		1																					
999	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� many features of the setting affected the cyclist. And these setting could be easily formed in the middle part of the essay. And these settings caused the cyclist exsaused on his journey. First, the cyclist noticed a rode change from flat to short, rolling hills. He had to spend more energy to go up the hills which caused him to loss a certain amount of  energy. Then, his lack of water caused him a dehydrated state. He could loss an another large amount of energy by this and out of this stage, he mostly needs someone to support him or be on his side, but he was riding alone, there was no one on sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. This might cause his emotion break down to make his energy to loss. Overall, the cyclist suffered a loss of energy on his journey. And was unable to have a supporter to help	2	3		3																					
1009	3	"In the essay, �Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling�, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, �The sun was beginning to beat down�, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a �modernized� town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."	3	2		3																					
1015	3	The features like not enough water not enough sense of direction, effect the cyclist because he needs water to keep on peadiling. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going. From not enough water he said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and there been sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that pargraph� That site ment that the old man�s sense of directin was out of date. They did not no where any thing was at just there in giant poarch.	1	1		1																					
1021	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all I think that when the cyclist came across the �ghost town� he felt alone and discouraged. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was. Overall I think that it had really physical and psycoligical effects on him. 	2	2		2																					
1022	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist runs into a couple obstacles and they affected him in many ways. In the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles. �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state.� This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had tumbleweed, a snake and he was dehydrated. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration. All through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well.	2	2		2																					
1024	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way.	2	1		2																					
1025	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly be coming dehydrated. Another feature is that all the building seem to be either abandoned or in despair.	1	1		1																					
1029	3	Because he is dehydrated, the setting makes him worse. He�s biking, in California, in @LOCATION2. It�s not and the sun is probably scorching. The heat plus all the biking he�s doing, is making him even more thirsty and tired.	1	1		1																					
1033	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist tremendously. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles until he passed through the flat round, that was replaced by short rolling hills. He said and I quoted �I toiledon� he sounds like it�s hopeless, that he wasn�t going to make it. As you can see the setting does effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1037	3	"The feature of the cyclist was very good �it erodding to who he say in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1�. I would describe it as a fun. It also looks this time was one of his bes time. Here are some examples he is happy, competive, and thin is full. I�m going to explain my examples. First, he looks hoppy becaus in the story he said �the morning with strong legs and smile on my face. the phase can to you how hoppy he felt. My second example was competive, he seems like a competive person, bcouse he is very heathy and lead to to take a ride from the bike. My third example is the way he is becasse he soid ""As easily as sounding  bond, my trouble, thirst and fears were all behind me the part made me feel.  "	1	2		2																					
1041	3	In the short story �Rough road ahead .Do not exceed posted speed limit ,� The cyclist faced many difficulties .These difficulties were the result of the setting .The story takes place in �the high deserts of California in June � .Because the month June is very warm , and the climate of California is usually hot and dry ,the cyclist ran into problems .Not only did this affect the cyclist , but he travelling through the desert .The setting also included several abandoned towns along the way , which contributed to the problem .The cyclistsoon ran out of water , and discovered the towns that lay before him were unoccupied .He had no choice but to continue with his the journey .	2	3		3																					
1050	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. �... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�. This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist.	1	1		1																					
1052	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in many ways, if it were hot out, he would be thirsty and sweaty. If there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty. The cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town. The cyclist said� I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine,� By saying this, he knows that he can make it that far as well as determined to do so. With the terrain causing even more trouble for him, would make it more difficult, but he knows that he must overcome his challenging activity but he still keeps a strong spirit with that, he can do just about anything because he has the encouragement he needs.	2	2		2																					
1054	3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .� The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,� In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it � had been a Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.� For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    	3	2		3																					
1060	3	The features of the setting in the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit� affect the cyclist. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as �a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.� The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, �The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large� snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn�t give up and is relieved when he finally receives water.	3	3		3																					
1062	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people, and cars on his �shortcut� he was in great doubt of his survival. �I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.� He thought he wouldn�t get any water because there was nothing around him and he thought he would die of dehydration or heatstroke. �And the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke.�	2	2		2																					
1067	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn�t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn�t in a �ghost town�, with the, �sun beggining to beat down�. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, �about forty miles into the petal�, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot.	2	2		2																					
1076	3	"After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,�water-deplating� one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as �rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrator�s hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally."	2	3		3																					
1077	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power.	2	2		2																					
1078	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways.for example, he ask the older guts, ""that haven't left rheir porches since carter was in the office where the next placewas to get water. Also he was out in the middle of nowhere. It was also in June were the weather was warm,and he didn't have a lot of water."	1	1		1																					
1082	3	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him.	1	1		1																					
1087	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer and more difficult and dangerous way to go. He takes the awee of going that way by some old folks that he says �haven�t gotten off there porches since carter was in office.� I think tha tthere would be a reason to not listen to them though they @MONTH1 have wisdom.	1	1		1																					
1088	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died.	2	1		2																					
1090	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.	1	1		1																					
1091	3	The hot wheather is dehydrating the cyclist, who can�t find more water. The hills are rough terrain is draining the energy he has. The heat is so rough he has to break the road down it to polants he wants to get to. He get drained physically and emotionally. He has a hard journey.	1	1		1																					
1099	3	"In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasnt traveling in a car, he was riding a bike and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike. ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel.� In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he�s at risk of running out. Not only that but he�s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.� I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.� So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings. "	3	2		3																					
1106	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For example when he was riding on the road he would pick a destination and ride to it. Then he would take a break. If this destination was a building he would be strong willed and determined. If it looked like their was nothing ahead but hills, he would just ride and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world.	1	1		1																					
1113	3	In the story the Features of the setting affects the cyclist is that when he is riding he has very little water. Also he takes advise from old men and he meets up with an @CAPS1 Snake and he goes down an dirt Road he has no water at the time there. The conclusion is that he comes of the dirt Road and @CAPS2 the main Road that he travels. Also he promised to stick to it in the @CAPS3. That is how you should stick things at in the future.	1	1		1																					
1114	3	The biker has many features in his story. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example �One long, crippling hill� I can picture it in my head. �There was no one in sight.� All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help.	1	1		1																					
1124	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because when all the cyclist is worried about is finding a place with water all he�s doing is getting scared and panicing. In other words, when he�s looking around, the setting he sees is like desert and no buildings. The story says, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� when he sees that he panics and thinks he�s not gonna make it which affects him mentally.	1	1		1																					
1125	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways The woman who had listen to the older men to get where she was going had made her run out water and almost died of thirst. As she was going to this place she had seen a snake �At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondback� (@NUM1). She started to see things that wasn�t there.	1	1		1																					
1129	3	Features of any setting affect what you do and how you do it. Features affect the cyclist by water, help, and saftey. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing what spit you have to circulate.� This quote so his desperate need for water by saying he sucks a on rock to drink his own spit. The rough terrain and abandoned road the old men sent him on that was out of date, made him unable to ask for directions, and to even know if he is travelling correctly. Along the road he meets a snake. Being so far away from civilization, if he was to have gotten bit then he would have no one to help save him from dyeing on the side of the road. Also, if he was to have a heatstroke he has no water and no help. Safty, help, and water are all factors which contribute to the features, and how they effect the cyclist.   	1	1		1																					
1130	3	The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard. It has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy. Also, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry. This makes the author need more water than he normally would. The author said ��I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without water, he said ��I could drop from heatstroke�� If the setting had been cooler there would not be so much danger.	2	2		2																					
1135	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. In the story it says, ""I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" This is telling the reader that the weather was hot and you need a lot of water here to survive, especially if you are riding a bike or working. Later on in the story it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This quote gives the reader information and tells us that the cyclist is having a hard time surviving through the harsh features of the setting through the harsh features of the setting. In California deserts I know from prior knowledge it is hot and dry, exspecially in the summer. If you are working outside, like the cyclist in this story is, and you do not have water to drink, you will get dehydrated which eventually leads to death. The author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
1138	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit � the setting affected the cyclist. The setting affected the cyclist mentally and physically, when the setting was nice he had a positive outlook and was full of energy. Later in the essay, as the setting grew less appealing, and more treaterous, the cyclist grew weary and distressed.	1	1		1																					
1139	3	A cyclist always has to face many problems such as the weather, the condition of the road, etc.	1	1		1																					
1141	3	The featers of the setting afected the cyclist by the lack of water made him tiered and a bit deloshional. The lack of shade increased the rate of dehidrashion. The rough road made it hard to balinc. And the snack slowed him dowen. He thought that he was going to die.	1	2		2																					
1144	3	"At the beginning of his journey, the cyclist is relaxed and the features of his environment. He says, �I enjoyed the seranety of an early- summer evening.� At a campground in @LOCATION1, the setting is calming and relaxing. At the first town, the setting is shocking, but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous. After looking around he says. �this sight was trowoling�. The cyclist tip gets worse when he reads for the next town. �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This part of his journey affects him the most. His environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty. The setting has a major role for a cyclist."	2	3		3																					
1146	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.� So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn�t help him much.  	3	2		3																					
1148	3	The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, �A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, �Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways.	1	2		2																					
1151	3	The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite @ORGANIZATION1�l Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it wouldve made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle @MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn�t. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn�t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It�s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it. 	2	3		3																					
1153	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1161	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not being in town. I say this Because the cyclist talks about �old timeres who haven't left the contines of their porches since carter was in office."" So that means he dousen't know were he's at."	1	1		1																					
1162	3	In the cyclists journey to Yosemite, several factors hinder him from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders. The second is that because the information wasn�t true, the cyclist had an insufficient amount of water. This made him dehydrated. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads, and old ghost towns and abandoned buildings which made the cyclist less confident. Those are the features of the setting which affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1165	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclists because he was thirsty and it was hot and he was almost out of water and he almost died because when he was drinking the water and he hit a bump and spit got lodged in his throat and tiring hills it seemed to never end.	1	1		1																					
1167	3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water �to feel sorry for himself� The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to �rolling hills�. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist.	3	2		3																					
1175	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who haden�t gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldn�t get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip.	2	3		3																					
1178	3	"The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park and on the way ran out of water. ""The wate bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� Then, hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� The rider didn�t think he would live �I was going to die and the birds would pick he clean� but he found a place to get water �drank deeply from the sink� and finished his ride."	2	2		2																					
1182	3	"In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is his lack of water:"" The water bottles contained only a few tantallizing sips. The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the welch�s grape juice factory. The  building-abandoned years earlier-had been a welch�s grape juice factory and bottling plant."" This despersion, after he had come to the abondoned factory, was followed by dissapointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abondoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1185	3	A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting. One feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard times on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling ??? know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks  on us. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature.	3	2		3																					
1186	3	The features of the setting inhance the cyclist�s desparate spirit. Throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people, cars, or buildings around. This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as �Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant� which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation.	2	2		2																					
1188	3	In the story the cyclisst had ran out of water. He had mentioned it tasted like battery acid. The surroundings affected him by looking around and not seeing anybody around for miles. That brings despair. Also a desert with the hot sun beating down on him and just the sand and catus all around. Now if you saw that you would think of no water or shade of noting because the desert is put to image when you hear those descriptions.	1	1		1																					
1193	3	The cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1 suffers from some hardship while riding through the desert. The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation that means there is no water so he was becoming dehydrated. Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldn�t quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasn�t been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welch�s juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved. Also the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left, and rocky tent to take more strength and endurance.	2	3		3																					
1199	3	In the essay intitled �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� It talks about a gentlemen who is riding a bike to �Yosemite� and he does not know exactly how to get there. So he stops and ask some old folks and he says �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porchers since Carter was in office.� @CAPS1 means they are not familiar with the changes. After he leaves the old-folks he continues on his long hot journey. He begins to run out of water and so he begins to panic. Next he comes to the sign that said �Rough	1	1		1																					
1202	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The text first mentions that, �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.� This shows that the cyclist felt in saccure and was starting to upset him. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist is, �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� You can see through the cyclists that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps were lame. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, �battery acid,� that he wouldn�t last much longer. In- conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. 	1	1		1																					
1203	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a �ramshackle shed� surrounded by �several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lames mule�, he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he can�t make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says �sometimes life can be so cruel� as he notices the speed limit to be @NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesn�t believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation �should please all sadists� reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling.	3	3		3																					
1206	3	The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, He is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, ��but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst�� This @CAPS1 is saying that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to get his mind off of how thirsty he was. I think this @CAPS1 is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that effected how thirsty the cyclist got was how hard he worked which was also a feature of the setting since during the end of his trip, he met rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat even more than he was. This made him @NUM1 more dehydrated. This story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you.	2	2		2																					
1213	3	Steep mountains, rolling roads, jagged rocks � are all reasons why the setting is affected towards the cyclist. Well the cyclist needs to know what is going on and what @MONTH1 happen. For example �Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This setting lead to a lot of changes. So yes the setting does reveals a lot and I guess it describes how the cyclist @MONTH1 react to it also. So yes I think the settings do affect the cyclist through this whole story.	1	1		1																					
1217	3	There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they won�t try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water. 	2	3		3																					
1219	3	I the essays the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch. The directions seem incorrect at first. The remains of a Grape Juice factory make it seem like he will never find civilization.	1	1		1																					
1221	3	The setting effected the cyclist severly. Biking in the desert following outdated directions nearly got him killed. He also came across several broken down factories and towns causing more dismay. However he came across a last stop that saved his life.	1	1		1																					
1230	3	The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time.	2	2		2																					
1242	3	"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what developes the character but, that what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself."	3	2		3																					
1243	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. There were	1	1		1																					
1246	3	When the cyclist first set off, he was doing fine, he had plenty of water. As he kept going, and sort of got of cause, he began to come into the desert region. He was hot, and he was ruunning out of water. This was making him dehydrated. Also, seeing the tumbleweeds, and lack of vegetation probably made him even worse mentally, because he was maybe thinking he was never going to get free from that. When he saw the fish bate shop though, he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved,    	2	2		2																					
1247	3	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected and one of these are the setting. The setting affects them because if it is short smooth setting the ride will be easy. But if it is long bumpy rough roads it will be harder to control the bike which means that the cyclist�s job will be harden this is how a cyclist is affected by his or her settings.	1	1		1																					
1248	3	The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory. No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1249	3	The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. �Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� Once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didn�t because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadn�t been running out of water I don�t think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse.	3	2		3																					
1251	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct.� This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,� by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.� This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, �To @CAPS2 a fire� where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. "	3	3		3																					
1254	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert and heat with no water cause him to get dehydrated. The rolling hills and rough terrain tire him out. In the story it says �and growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This shows that the heat and terrain could cause him to over heat and live a heat stroke.	1	1		1																					
1255	3	The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example in the text he says �the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips� and then it goes on to say, �I could drop from from a heat stroke.� This showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat.	2	1		2																					
1258	3	The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot and going up those hills had to be hard. The road was also very rough. It says, �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� It also says, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1268	3	The features affect the cyclist.The setting affects the cyclist because it�s real hot. So he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men. Then come to find out these tips weren�t really short cuts. So now he�s riding and angry that he took their tips. Also he�s running out of water and becoming dehydrated. He sees an abonded place with water, but in order to get it you need to pump it. So he starts pumping and sees black gunk. He pumps for about @NUM1 to cool the water, but it doesn�t cool off. Come to find out the water tastes like battery acid. So he starts riding again. but encounters a snake. Luckily he gets away, but he feels that he�s about to die and regrets listening to men who haven�t got off their porch since @PERSON1 was president. What makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure. As as he's riding he sees a juice factory and goes there. Now it�s a fishing store and drinks lots and lots of water. He also says he�s never listening to old men and he�ll always use the map.	3	2		3																					
1270	3	The features of the surrounding setting affect the cyclist from hi/her performance for example, In the essay �Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted SPeed Limit� the setting is full of hills, twisting, rising and desending. All of these things are working against the energy that the cyclist has. Also, the lack of the people in towns give the cyclist a hard and depriving time on finding a water supply so he/she does not dehydrate. Third the weather in the essay has a great deal of being affected on the cyclist it is hot in the desert of California and the cyclist has to be very hydrated to continue on his bike ride.  	2	2		2																					
1273	3	I think features affect the cyclist because when you write a bycles you need to con	1	1		1																					
1274	3	"In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist has a very long journey that it�s affected by a variety of things, and problems. The cyclist is confident with himself at the beginning but after a few moments he feels really bad, and learns a really good lesson. �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" the cyclist shows that it is really hard for him to move without water. This quote shows that he is not only thirsty but dehydrated which is several for a human being. The cyclist also had a really bad time, because he had to taste stones in order to make his thirst go away, one example of that is when"	2	2		2																					
1275	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist is confronted with a troubling setting on his journy to Yosemite. He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This setting is a major setback to the cyclist�s journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best outof it. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perserverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey.	3	3		3																					
1279	3	The fatures of the setting affected the cyclist by it hard for him to control hill bike down on rough road, hotter making him thisty and running out of water. Also there wasnt an building in sight so he could get anything to drink. Also he did know where he was go. These are the features that affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1281	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because �never accept travel advice from	1	1		1																					
1282	3	"The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way. He intrusted that these men he had asked directions from knew what they were talking about. With the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination. Only to find deserted towns, disowned factorys, and hills. With all this being the �high deserts of California in June.� With all these aspects the cycalrst was worn out and dehydrated saying �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst"" shaving his deep name of thirst. After finding a place to get a drink he stated �I had an overwhelming and buy some bait� showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water."	2	2		2																					
1284	3	While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite. �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� The cyclist continued on his spirits as well as her water supply going down. The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building. ��telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine.� @CAPS1 many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones. ��slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� @CAPS2 the cyclist found a deserted building, he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist found open store with modern bathrooms, he had �an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1, kiss them, and buy some bait.� At the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map.	2	3		3																					
1289	3	The feature of the setting do affect cyclist in such ways making him illusionalistic and dehydrated. He saw all idea that a juice factory was working, when it was abounded. He saw rusty pipes, this made him dehydrated because he knew those pipes could never produce water.	1	1		1																					
1294	3	In the begining of the story, a young cyclist sets out on a long journy to Yosemite national park. Along  his ride he meets some old but confident men. They tell him a new rout wich �was to slice away hours� from his ride the setting was excedingly hot @DATE1. He was supposed to encounter a few thriving towns along the way the first was a �baren ghost town� the next had water �the flavor of battery acid, then he came to an abanded welches grape juice factory. The author navigated through a very trying setting until he reached a baite shop. The advice that he gives to his readers is to stick to your guns & don�t let old timers try and change your mind.	3	2		3																					
1299	3	In the story,� Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� written by the @CAPS1, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, �Flat roads was replaced by short, riding hills �@CAPS2 as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and care free and the land had no hills and he flat. However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure� tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me.� The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.    	3	3		3																					
1301	3	In the book �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting was in codi, California. The author went on a journey	1	1		1																					
1302	3	Throughout the riders long journey the setting greatly affected him. For example, the hot weather caused him to drink the majority of water suply making him dehydrated and tired. If the weather was cool he would have lasted much longer.	1	1		1																					
1306	3	All the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hoy out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips� and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke.	2	2		2																					
1313	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he is in the desert and it is very hot outside. Also he is running out of water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because he�s pretty much dehydrated. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water. In conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way.	2	2		2																					
1322	3	In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions  of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels, � The  sun was beginning to beat down , � (Kurmaskie) .He is starting to get tired �because � it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June �. (Kurmaskie).Not only is he very tired and hot not where he is riding is barron and open and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. Through the passage you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cycler can change how and why how he does. 	2	2		2																					
1331	3	Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are �the cool pines and rushing rivers� they affect the cyclist by keeping him cool and energized by the senery and the temperature, another is the juice factory and it was old and shut down showing that he would die alone. The goast town which was completely and utterly desserted showing that the place is barren and unlivible these are some of the features the affect the biker.	2	1		2																					
1334	3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers �shortcut� as he states that �things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� But what he didn�t know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first �town� which was a ghost town. He wasn�t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how �a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting.	3	3		3																					
1337	3	The features in the setting affect cyclist in many ways. One of which is bring only to carry so much equipment which @MONTH1 be needed. For example, you can only take so much water with you and once you run out of there are no buildings or anything around that you are out of luck. Also, you can only take so much food. Finally, when you are ready to go to sleep you can�t just pull over you have to ride until you find a hotel or get home. I know that I would not make it. So those are just a few reasons on why the setting affects cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1339	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him in a way because he wouldn�t have to use strength and pedal as hard without having as much water in his body. When he came to a pump, it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid. The dryness of the dessert had a bad affect on the cyclist because he wasn�t able to get to the Yosemite water until the end. The breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down. The features of the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1340	3	Many things that involve settings can affect other things. In the �Do not exceed the posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National park. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day�.� (kurmaskie @NUM1). The sertting from the day is affecting him very much and it is hard for him to continue. He is very tired and almost sick from the heat. The settings of this place are hurting to the cycleist and he wants to go home and away from the heat. The setting of this place effects the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
1341	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way that the features affect the cyclist, is that it is summer time, and it harder for the cyclist because	1	1		1																					
1350	3	When you do something really to often you get used to it, well I think is the same thing with how sitting affects the cyclist features. It might make their butt flat or their back has a diferent shape and with different shep I dont mean that they are diformed but evey person is diferen so their back can either have a �@CAPS1� shape or an �I� shape or a �D� shape.	0	0		0																					
1354	3	One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, �About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town.� This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn�t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization.	3	3		3																					
1359	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered.	2	2		2																					
1361	3	The features of the setting affected the cycles beceuse it was hot and was a mough train.	1	1		1																					
1364	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because if there is a rough road ahead your just going to have to be able and to handle the up and downs, bumps. The author was scared that he was gonna die and that the birds were gonna pick his bones clean.	1	1		1																					
1370	3	In the essay �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� By Joe Kurmaskie. The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was on a bike and it was hot he ran into bumpy roads, and hills. For example he says �Not June miles into the next section of the road. He noticed the terrains changing. Flat land was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 example is �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that he could die from heatstroke.� These examples show that it was not easy and how the features affected the cyclist. In conclusion this story shows that you should never take directions from a old person, exspecially if its hot and you are riding a bike.	1	1		1																					
1382	3	In the story, The man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. He faces many obsticales in the story. For example, he has gone about @NUM1 miles without water. Also, their are a lot of hills and turns withen the story which slow him down He is having a hard time getting to water because of many obsticals	1	1		1																					
1383	3	In the story the cyclist is on a bike ride to @LOCATION1. He has a new map is doing very well, until he asks these old men the best way to get there taking less time and by getting these faster a.k.a a short at. He takes there directions and feels good abut it. But soon things change, he experiences new terrain and it becomes much harder. The type of setting that he faces are steep hills, speed limits that he can�t exceed, dry hot temperature, and he has no water. All these features combine together to make the situation worse. While he is experiencing these things he feels like he is going to die and feels like giving up. But eventually he finds someone and doesn�t ask for directions. So the lession is don�t take directions from a stranger unless your willing to face the unexpected. 	3	2		3																					
1384	3	The features affected the cyclist because of the rough roads. This affected him because it slowed him down, I know this because in the story it said �Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit�. which this means slow down or you will have an accident. Another feature has it was hot which means he was losing water because it either evaporated or he was drinking it. I know this because it said �The water bottles contained  water a few tantalizing sips� which means it was few left.	2	1		2																					
1397	3	The cyclist was exhausted as he was going up hill. The setting of story affects the cyclist alot. This is because in California it is really good to be cycling. The weather is warm and perfect for a town. It had one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that could not hold in the lamest mule greeted him.Besides that, after riding twenty miles ahead, there was a terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. After he crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at him. The rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit.	2	1		2																					
1403	3	Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story.	1	1		1																					
1419	3	The condition the cyclist are in calls for a lot of preparation. The cyclist was in a hot desert area with winding road and hills. The cyclist need to have plenty of water to make it where he is going, and, as read in the story, the conditions almost caused @CAPS1 health to the man who was trying to ride through.	1	1		1																					
1424	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. First is the emptiness, the feeling that he is all alone. Nor a car, person  or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone. That it would be along while before  anyone would be able to  find him. Nor that  might ecase some, But I think dalved him even more. It gave him that extra boost of energy that seems  to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of animal. The desert environment is very, unforgiving. The sun beats down like your only person on the plannet. The lack of water the food that it hasn�t rained in decades. The never ending, @CAPS1 road. The ups and downs and all the animals that await him. The fact that if he stops at all, ever, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment that is explained in the text has alot to do with the cyclist and affects him a great deal.  	2	3		3																					
1427	3	"The features of the setting have affected the cyclist in �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" greatly, first he statrs off happy because he�s going to Yosemite national park and he�d gotten short cut advice that would make his trip shorter. ""He rode into the morning with strong legs,� Then he got to the first stop. It looked like a buzzing town at one time, but now a ghost town. So he kept on with plenty of water and thought he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. He was hitting the water pretty regular and the hot sun was beating down on him. The next terrain changed he thought he would die & have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then became to his next stop which seemed to be an old welch�s grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water a hot sun. next the hills came & he paced himself a little time, then he finally came to a modern looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After that he been through asuring himself he would die he was relieved to see the old man�s there he would forever on listen to their advice because he made it."	1	1		1																					
1428	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesn�t have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. �This statement proves that the cyclist wasn�t a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that aren�t there, but you want to see those things. � I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. �It was a good decision that the cyclist didn�t get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful.	2	2		2																					
1435	3	During this bikers adventure heat and lack of water affect him. In this short story when the cyclist feels lost he says �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� This suggests that the rider was faced with the extreme heat of the desert during his ride. He also says �The water bottles contained only a few tantilizing sips.� This quote shows that not only was he faced with the heat, but also with lack of water. These facts and quotes show the clear threats this biker faced on his long bike-ride.	2	2		2																					
1444	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist because of his enduranc. The amount of time he can ride without stopping, houever long he can ride up hill, how ever many bumps he rides over, however long he can ride without a drink of water.	1	1		1																					
1446	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by for the roads and heat has. He has tine ling through a desert in June which made it really hot for him, @CAPS1 that the road was bumpy and that made him have to pedal harder.  The @CAPS1 had to prit more effort into it because the romds here long and he had the spirit and determination to get to Yosemite. He @CAPS1 ran into a snake which told him that I am getting deeper into the desert.	2	2		2																					
1447	3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the tormils in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills the Welch factory, & finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a heven, @NUM1 safe ground that contains everything the men needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready & eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is wher the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as �the high deserts of California.� The sun is boiling down & water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder the chances of his survival lessons. When he crosses a snake, it suggest even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive & is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
1451	3	In the story the cyclist explains how the road goes from good to bad: An example,� Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit. Also the dry.	1	1		1																					
1454	3	'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrian changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills'' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficulty he become more ignorant and hopeless. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. it was a sad, hopeless laugh'' (@NUM1). He wasn't goig to die, die but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. ''Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timerd who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office'' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot raod, and he started taking stabs at the old men ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (@NUM4) The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back thos trip of only a few rough terrain, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless,angry, and he felt sorry for himself.	3	3		3																					
1459	3	Hot, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink. He will get dehydrated. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structur of any kind. Finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road. So he had to move around it.	2	2		2																					
1471	3	THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE �SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,� AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO EFFECT HIM A COUPLE OF WAYS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN �GHOST TOWNS� THAT CONSISTS OF �RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS� AND �SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS.� THESE FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL HOPELESSNESS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIN�T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED.  OBSTACLES SUCH AS �TUMBLEWEEDS� AND �PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES� ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVE ON THE �@NUM1 ROAD� ONLY DOING �12 MPH.� ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON.  THE OBSTACLE BEING A �LONG CROPPING HILL,� THIS MADE THE CYCLIST EXHAUSTED, AS HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL, HE WAS ??? ???? ??? ???	3	2		3																					
1472	3	Topic: The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting affect a cyclist or the major problem that a cyclist encounter are some rough road, inspection of the bike, putting on necessary equipment, do not exceed posted speed limit For a cyclist to be doing all this I don think there is going to be any features of the setting affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to maintaining the speed limit of @NUM1 or a water-depleting @NUM2: sometimes life can feel so cruel. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much of speed but for them to be using the necessary equipment they won�t get seriously injured. Forget that old saying about never taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be �Never accept to	1	1		1																					
1474	3	"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welch�s Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, �with all my strength.� @CAPS1 he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because �it had the flavor of battery acid.� Next, the Welch�s Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of �a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice�, made him feel worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, all refreshments in the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am alergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2�s peanut shade. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and ""drank deeply from the sinle.� He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sush : bar, and sush: is my favorite food."	3	3		3																					
1477	3	The cyclist is most affected by e heat. He is exerting all his energy and will to get to Yosemite. The hot sun and lack of water makes him very tired and causes him to use his energy inefficiently. At one point, he has to make sure the building is a mirage. It is so hot his mind could be playing tricks on him.	1	1		1																					
1480	3	The features of his journey are cruel. �Rolling hills,� make him work harder to get over them. The more he works, the more he sweats and therefore he needs fluids to do so. The lack of water he has does not help. Poisonous don�t really bother him if he leaves alone. The condition of the roads adds on to the hills. Rough roads make him work hard to get through and then over the hills. So this guy is getting it pretty rough.	2	1		2																					
1493	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie�s �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The terrain has a great deal to do with it. Also, the heat: First, the terrain affects the cyclist. It affects the cyclist because there is alot of hills. The text says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.� In order to go down a hill, you had to have gone up a hill. So, having to use the energy to pedal up hills affected the cyclist alot. Next, the heat affected the cyclist. I know this because the text says �and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.� This proves it is extremely hot outside. Heat would affect the cyclist because heat prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability. That is how the features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. The terrain affects the cyclist because of the hills. The heat because it drains your energy quick. "	2	2		2																					
1494	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him is the towns were old and deserted. In the story he said �This place might have been a thriving little spot� but @CAPS1 it was a ghost town.� He could not get any water or any directions. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because the roads were bumby and there were many hills. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 the cyclist had to use all his power to manuever over the hills. The third reason why the setting affected the cyclist was the weather and that it was a desert. �I was traveling through the deserts of California in June.� He was hot, sweaty and thirsty. He was also tired and desperate to find water and town that was not deserted. The features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by the roads, deserted towns and the lack of water.	2	2		2																					
1499	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negitvly because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no stones too get a drink at, For example he says �There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind's. This explains how his setting affected him because he had no where to go or get a drink. That is my reason why the cyclist settings where negitve.	1	1		1																					
1500	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in bad ways. The rocky road and steep hills made him peddle harder. The old people made him go through the rocky way. The temperature from the desert made him thirsty so he ran out of water fast, He said �When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� The heat could have killed him anytime. For example �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This ride this man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous ride.  	2	2		2																					
1519	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting of the terrain was hot and water draining. In the text it says �Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees� this proves that the cyclist is exagerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says �I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.� This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out. In conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best. 	2	2		2																					
1520	3	"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, �Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view�. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. Also it says in the story �I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."	3	3		3																					
1521	3	Usally the features, setting has an major affect upon the cyclist. The features, setting relates, and describes the hassh, and eventually relief condition of the cyclist. The setting relates to the person and plays a role, which the cyclist can observe. One reason how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is it shows the various problems that are being faced with the cyclist. For example, the cool pines, no one in sight, and I am alone. The way how this interepts a clear meaning, I the cyclist needs help getting home, and eventually by traveling, he needs water, to fill his thirst. Prior to thisy, the features, shows the weakness of the cyclist. For example, with that i believed it was my last burst of energy, as I consently, maneuvered down the hill. The features, and settings, affect the cyclist by showing how he was facing his troubles, thirst and fear, which all lead behind him at the end. These features and settings develop a clear understandmet, for the cyclist, and what is to be expected, in by him.	3	2		3																					
1529	3	The setting affects the cyclist by wanting to go longer and riding the bike. And to see what is up ahead. By riding a bike in the heat, you can have a heat stroke and die from dehydration and the heat. That�s why you are supposed to have a lot of water with you when you are riding a bike.	1	1		1																					
1530	3	THE CYCLIST SETTINGS HINDER HIM IN THE ESSAY �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD. THE CYCLIST IS IN THE DESERT IN THE SUMMER TIME WITH HARDLY ANY WATER. HE IS TRYING TO FIND HIS WAY TO YOSEMITE, BUT HE GETS LOST ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE SOME OLD MEN GAVE HIM BAD DIRECTIONS. DURING THIS TIME HE IS RIDING HIS BICYCLE FOR MILES AND MILES IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER. HIS THOUGHTS OF THIRST GET IN THE WAY OF HIM TRYING TO CONTINUE ON TO FIND YOSEMITE. I BELIEVE THAT IF THE CYCLIST WAS IN A COOLER ENVIRONMENT THEN THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BECAUSE HIS SETTINGS WERE SORT OF A DISTRATION TO HIM	1	2		2																					
1531	3	The cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all. he was in the desert in june very hot day and every town he had come to was abandoned and had no water. It was also very hilly which made the work even harder. 	3	2		3																					
1533	3	The cyclist �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was definatly affected by the setting. He was cycling in California - which is a hot place to begin with - in June - which made it even hotter coming upon a hot desert. When you�re doing a physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get hot and he was out of water. This affected his body by making him tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself. Then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice. He said �In an ironic twist abandon years earlier had been a Welch�s grape juice factory and bottling plant.� He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant. The cyclist was definatly affected by his surrondings both mental - by saying �I�m going to die.� - and physically by becoming dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
1540	3	Excitement, desperation, and self-pitty are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite park because of it peacefulness. He said, �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name.� He wanted to get their because it was so hot. He started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of this hot water hole. �I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid.� He was running out of water so he got desperate for some. He started to have self-pitty on his self,� sometimes life can be so cruel,� he was feeling pitty on himself because he had such a long way to go still. These are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting.	2	2		2																					
1544	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by when the story says �Twenty miles up the road. I came to a fork of sorts�, This statement from the story affected the cyclist because he didn�t know which way to go. Another feature that affected the setting is when the story says �I got on my hand and knees, Working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength�. That statement shows that the cyclist was dieing for water and he didn�t think any was going to come out. Last feature that affected the cyclist was when the story says �Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. This shows that the rider had to go under a speed limit but he was earlier tired and he was going way under it and that he could make it up the rough road.	2	3		3																					
1546	3	In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert which dehydrated him and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the  towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they don�t get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise.	2	3		3																					
1547	3	Because the setting of the cyclist ride is dry desert it makes the cyclist seem more and more determined. He's is going against the odds so it seems like hes pushing himself to the limit. Against the heat and the long road he's on and having no water all seems lost for the cyclist. But in the end he pulls himself together and makes it happen for himself and triumphs over adversity.	1	1		1																					
1564	3	The desert is the crulest of nature�s environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert�s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.� If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, � I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. �As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, �the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear�.	3	2		3																					
1566	3	The features in the setting, such as the ghost town desert, and the Juice factory, give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness. He is running out of water when he comes to the ghost town, which he thought was @CAPS1 because the next town was only a short ways down the road. However when he came to the next �town� and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot, foul liquid came up instead of water. He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welch�s factory, abandoned. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming �the birds will pick me clean,� To the cyclist also was best, then he was �saved� by a bait shop. These features in the setting gradually emptied his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his fait in old men, was returned.	2	3		3																					
1568	3	This essay takes place on a barren desert landscape.The setting being very hot causes him to get dehydrated faster. Also fones are scarce. In this place as he says sometime into free essay, �the negg down was only @NUM1 down the road. This place also caused him to question what he saw thinking it might be just a mirage.	1	1		1																					
1571	3	The setting affected the cycist because it made his ride harder. For example, the weather was extremly hot. �The sun was beginning to beat down.� He says it didn�t affect him, yet he was very thirsty and dehydrated so internally it affected him. Also, the weeds and snakes frightened him. �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� This could not of made his ride easier. Next the hills and roads, �over one long, crippling hill.� This proves how intense his ride was. Thats how the setting affected the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie.	1	2		2																					
1580	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of them is that it was in the daylight and the sun bothers the cyclist. Another one is that because there was nothing around him, he felt frustrated. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� If something were there, he wouldn�t feel frustrated and at least he would have more hope to find something. 	1	2		2																					
1583	3	It is very difficult to be outside in heat, let alone advise from old folks and riding a bike. If it feels like it is @NUM1 out sides, you don�t need to be out there. Doesn,t matter how long you are outside for, a heatstroke could come at any body fast than they can count to @NUM2.	1	1		1																					
1590	3	The features of a setting, such as terrain and weather greatly affect the cyclist who is biking in it. The features of a setting can make the cyclists trip either easier or harder. Weather can make them use up their water faster or slower, rain as bad road conditions could force a cyclist go slower. In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist is slowed down and more fatigued because of the features of the setting he was in. The lack of water and settlements slowed him down. Rough roads did as well. Hills and animals on the road slowed down the cyclist even more.  The features of a setting can help or hinder a cyclist, and in the case of the one in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features seriously impared his bike ride.	2	2		2																					
1593	3	"When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome when he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty. The text says ""pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid.� The second drink source he passed was on abandoned @PERSON1�s Juice factory. The text says,�a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth.� These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, then it was taken away."	2	3		3																					
1597	3	"In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. He followed the �short cut� that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer route. These old men had no clue what they were realy talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path through more obstacles. When the cyclist was in need of more water he ran into ""several rusty pumps."" No water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going @CAPS1 water. As he moved forwad in his travels he said that the �Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 any water, he did not have much strength left to face rolling hills, but he had no choice. The cyclist had to go on for miles @CAPS1 seeing anyone or anything. �There was noone in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" His troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp."	2	2		2																					
1599	3	In the story, do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist was affected about the road ahead. He took advice that he thought was right but it was wrong. So it took him off track of his good he was trying to reach	1	1		1																					
1612	3	The cyclist was is a horrible nasty environment for cycling, but the thing that really threw the cycle off was running out of water. There were no houses to refill his bottle or no one around to give him updated directions. From the heat made him drink more water and also harder to breath in extreme heat. Without those faults the cyclist would have been fine.	1	1		1																					
1638	3	In the story the setting affected the cyclist all through the story till he arrived at body and wilbers fish camp. As the man rides his bike for a while he is of but as he road into the first town it seemed to be a ghost town. As he pedal on � The sun was beginning to beat down but I barely noticed it�. At that time the wheater is affecting him a lot but he keeps Yosemite cool pines and rushing rivers in his head He also only had only a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottle while going up a big hill.	2	1		3																					
1641	3	Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, �That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� Because it was hot. This could make the cyclist thirsty. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion. We know their were many hills because in the text it says.� Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� Going over all those hills can really tire someone out. A third feature of te setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake. This making it dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during @DATE1, not June.	3	3		3																					
1642	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,� the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement �the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them� helps describe the cyclist situation. The idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 hope during his increasinlgly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equal a good out come. Later on, the cyclist comes across �one ramshackle shed, several rusts pump, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest make.� This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And inteact at this point the cyclist becomes troubles to his situation. While pedaling through desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, cones by. The nile of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story �The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1.� @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a deslated land filled wild beast to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personalith surrounded by uncivilized people and creating @PERSON2 tears of his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured. Part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay �Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit� is used as an important for character development.  	3	3		3																					
1652	3	In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, features of setting affect the cyclist because there is old people that been around for along time and you can�t ask for advice because they�re to old old to give information and wouldn�t know what their talking about. �A better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches sine Carter was in office.� That is the features of the setting and examples from the essay.	1	1		1																					
1655	3	In the story �rough road ahead� the setting and the features affect the cyclist. For example in the story he says �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate�. This shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperatly thirsty unless it was very hot out. The setting and features of this story is it takes place in California, on a hot day. Another quote that could support the question is when the author says, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage.� This shows that it is hot because he is sweating. This also could show that it is hot because he thinks it�s a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot.	2	2		2																					
1656	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, the as the cyclist rode on for the first miles, he did not see anything in sight. This made him less determined to reach his goal. Then, in paragraph @NUM1, the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal. The cyclist�s determination went down as long as he was riding. But then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself.	2	1		2																					
1664	3	The setting in the passage is working against the cycler. Hes running low on water hes almost dehydrated and the weather were hes at is very very hot and he cant see a town for miles.	1	1		1																					
1666	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the good way. For examples he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport. He would be rich because he would win the contest of cycling.	0	0		0																					
1669	3	The cyclist was affected by many features of the setting. The flat road soon became bumpy hills, which were made harder to cycle because of lack of water. The hot desert sun and lack of towns and people also made the journey difficult.	1	1		1																					
1671	3	There are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. One reason is because it is so hot, I know this because it was sammertime in the California desert. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the sign that he saw that said �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1). This tells you that the road is very rough. And being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from. There is no one around to give him a drink of water. These are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1675	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the river and the pine trees �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"". Thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" and a sign on another road said �rough road ahead� The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low. �the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing  sips.� Not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandon or �ghost town�. The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite national park."	2	3		3																					
1679	3	The setting of the desert is a hard setting to be in with no water or help. If the author would have been on a population trait with water fountain and shade, he would have been fine. But, he was in the desert no one around, hot, dry, no water, and no shade. �tumbleweeds crossed my path� (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This dicride his loneleness because no one was in the desert to help him. The setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp. The setting had a huge affected on the author.	2	2		2																					
1682	3	"The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. ""The journey nass make an snake this quote and that there made it seem like he is in the middle of know were and is ulcoming no plass because the man on the pourch said it would not be to far. The first town also was empty and when saw the town he was excited to go and feel a little out when he got closer he realized that the town has been abandoned this whole time so he was forced to keep going out the empty town made him feel almost hopless. In his attempts to make it to that next town, that how the setting mos affected the cyclist in the way that it did."	2	2		2																					
1686	3	Different features of the settings affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is based in the desert has a negative affect on the character. �The desert land is baron, leaving him only with his small supply of water. During his journey he runs out of water causing him to lose contact with reality. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his trip. To his dismay, it turns out to be a no more than a mirage. The lengthy road also affected the trip. The length and roughness of the road had worn the cyclist down.	1	1		1																					
1687	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, �The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water�� He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn�t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing.	3	3		3																					
1690	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist mentally, physically, positively and negatively. For instance, had been do @CAPS1's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy by pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still been seen."" This affected the author mentally, making him remember he had no water. Which inturn affected him physically by becoming dehydrated as moments passed. So overall that setting features had a negative direction affect on the cyclist. Another example, ""One ramshacked shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling."" This affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again. It also affected him physically because the water tasted like ""battery acid"" which put him deeper into his dehydration state. This setting features had a negative affect on the cyclist. The setting features and had they affected the cyclist is like an environment a person is adised in and how it makes them who they are."	3	2		3																					
1694	3	Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone than the cyclist would have tirerd less quickly making his journey easyer. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1696	3	The terrain setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The fast that he was in a desert made him thirsty. There was no towns any sign of water to quench his thirst. The hills he would dtwepend than heartycle town just  made him moretired. These what the setting did to the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1698	3	"Every body experiences physical and emotional pain, but most probably wouldn't have survived what the cyclist in this story went through. The man started a bike ride Yosemite National park, but when some eldrerly men told him a short cut, his adventure had just because. First at all, every ""town""and ""building"" the men told him he would come to, would come to, wound up being completely desserted. At first this wasn't a big deal to the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph when he came to his first desserted town he, ""chuckled, checked [his] water town supply, and moved."" @CAPS1, as his journey progressed, his water decreased.He was then in desperation for a town.On topof thatin the story he wrote, ''the tast roadwas replaced short, rolling hills. ""This made his biking harder and he was then becoming denyarated. He finally found a town with water, but learned his lesson from taking advice from strangers and old men. "	3	3		3																					
1700	3	"There are many features of the setting that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit,"" The time of year affected the cyclist because it�s mid June, @CAPS1 the region affected the cyclist because mid June in arizona is extremely hot and try. If it was in a more northern state in @DATE1 or I, ll it wouldn�t be as bad and you world not have the dance of a heat struggles. @CAPS1 when the terrain changed from flat to hills this affected him because it made it harder for him the to ride. These are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit."""	1	1		1																					
1708	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man�s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	2	2		2																					
1717	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is riding through the desert in the middle of June yet he has very little water. This affects him because he is thirsty but he doesn�t have a lot of water to drink and he is in a desert in the middle of June which makes it very hot. Also in the story it says he comes to Welch�s Grape Juice Factory were on the side of the building he see picture of a �young boy pouring a refreshing a loss of juice into his mouth� This make the cyclist even thirstier but he continues one to find water at a bait shop.	1	1		1																					
1722	3	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path. He had lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.�  	2	2		2																					
1723	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist like if you have to goup hill or along long bumpy type roads. Then in the essay it says �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit: @CAPS1 does make things more difficult than average. Especially with a lack of water to make things worse.	1	1		1																					
1737	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story started out by Saeng failing the test, going out and buying a plant to comfort her and confessing to her mom. The plant related to her by the memories of her homeland and when she failed that test she felt very depressed and sad. She cried to show her pain, and bought a plant to cheer her up. As she told her mom she felt the pain again but, her mother made her favorite food and helped her plant the plant. She knew that it wasn�t like the old plant but, it was the thought and memories she knew that she couldn�t just give up, so when it came the right time she was going to try the test again. It relates because it helps the readers understand the story a little better and shows that she wasn�t going to just quit. Her mother was very understanding and when she goes to retake the test she will be prepared. That is how it relates back to the story.	2	2		2																					
1740	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show a sense of determination that Saeng posesses. When Saeng comes back and shows her mother the hibiscus plant, she is very upset, with tears in her eyes.Her mother at first is disappointed in her for buying the plant, but is then understanding when she realizes that Saeng was distraught. The mother offers to help Saeng plant the hibiscus, which comforts Saeng a little bit, helping her gain the determination she needs to recover. The story says �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This quote states that Saeng realizes that things at home can be the same as things in her new country. The author uses the term �familiar� to express that Saeng is starting to accept the fact that some things @MONTH1 be different, but she will eventually get used to it, making her view on life more positive.  	2	2		2																					
1744	4	The arthur uses it because Saeng got confidence back from planting the hibiscus and everything that happened that year. So now shes ready and that�s what the arthur wanted the reader to figure out.	1	1		1																					
1747	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph by teaching Saeng how to be confident and vow silently, In order to teach her more lessons because of the fact she failed the test in the middle of the passage Saeng tells her mother that when the snow is gone in the spring time she will retake the test that she failed. Her mother was very upset when she found out that Saeng failed the test the first time.	1	1		1																					
1748	4	They probably ended it like that to build suspense of leave the reader on a good note because someone @MONTH1 think things are going to get better for them and Saeng @MONTH1 get her license. They @MONTH1 get more money.	1	1		1																					
1751	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all things have routins and things they have to do to survive. The geese fly @CAPS1 for the warm months so they don�t die from the cold. The flower dies in the winter is brought back to life in the spring. This pertains to Saeng because when the geese and the flowr come back she will take the test of trying to fit in, in her new country, That is why the auther chose this to end the story.	2	1		2																					
1752	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, the author ends with the last specified paragraph, �When they came back�then I will take that test again.� because it leaves many un-answered questions the reader might have. The reader then might want to read her next piece of work. Basically, the last paragraph drows attention to the reader. many of the unanswered questions revolve around, �I failed the test.�. We also do not know �her gentle grandmother�, �mrs.Lambert�, and �home�. Another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have a effect on the reader. The reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What will happen? All we know is, �when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader. This is why, I believe the author of �Winter Hibiscus� ended with the specified paragraph.	1	2		2																					
1762	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted to show just cause saeng failed that test don�t mean she giving up. she said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take it again. what the author means that right now she has failed but over time she can study and learn more to get ready to re take it. And by the time she ready to take the test the snow with have went away every should be hot out the birds come back and the flower is growing fine. she  will take it. And how author ended it lets us know she going to take it but how he use the words let us know that she will not only take it but pass it too.	2	1		2																					
1765	4	the author added that sentence to the story to show how much Saeng cared about the snow and the plants. She says that she much rather do gardening then school work. She loves planting new things.	0	0		0																					
1768	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is most comfortable when she is surrounded by things from her homeland. She thinks she will be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again, and when the hibiscus begins to bud. Narrator says ��A saebya ledges tall and high, had surrounded their garden��� @CAPS2 is evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well reminds her of it. The narrator also says,�� Overhead, a flock of @CAPS1 geese, their faint looks clear and -yes-familiar to Saeng now,�� @CAPS2 proves that the geese symbolize @CAPS3 home also.     	2	2		2																					
1771	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wrote the same thing that it had in the paragraph and he wrote it in his story but added a little more details to it and problems and things.	0	0		0																					
1772	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng is respectful and how her feelings miss her homeland. First example when �Saeng vowed silently to herself� it shows how she respect and miss her homeland. It tells that she want to try again about her failure in the past. The last example when she want to overcome her failure in the past. The last line of the paragraph say �then I will take that test again�. It says she want another. Chance on her life. These are the example of the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
1774	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won�t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point.	1	1		1																					
1775	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng�s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about.	3	2		3																					
1780	4	"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent.� @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant."	0	0		0																					
1781	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows Saeng passion for gardening. How she�s willing to take the test is to see if her plants can grow when spring comes around and the hibiscus starts to bud she will attempt to grow it which shows how anxious Saeng is for gardening and to try and get the hibiscus to grow during the spring.	0	0		0																					
1782	4	The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.	1	1		1																					
1785	4	For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior. She said ��when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again. So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     	1	2		2																					
1787	4	In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, �when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again�     	3	2		3																					
1788	4	"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. Saeng missed her home. It was hard for her to say her country�s home without crying. ""It�s not like the wind we had at-at-."" She also spent @MONEY1 on a plant because it remind her of back at home. One could inter she adapted because she was familiar with the season change and it states when the geese return she is going to take the test again."	1	2		2																					
1793	4	The author concludes the story with in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is  budding then I will take that test again, because she is saying there will be a new year. For example he failed it the first time she will wait until she tries again. Another example she just want to try until she get her driving license.	1	1		1																					
1797	4	Hope, a new beginning, adjustment-all are reasons why the speaker concludes by saying �when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� That hibiscus flower gives that girl hope because it remind her of her grandmother and back home, how wonderful things were back there, and by the flower blooming, she realize it could wear out there too. She�ll also have a new beging in the spring, by spring she should adjust to her surrounding and have new friends, things to do, and new memories to look back on, that looking backabout flawall won't be as bad the flower will bring her hope and comfort with her adjustment.	2	2		2																					
1798	4	The author is saying that she�s not doing nothing intell it is a nice day outside. Also she want it to be not that cold but not that not for she can come out and play with her children. Then she said she will take her test again for a nice day outside for her.	1	1		1																					
1801	4	"The author had concluded her paragraph like this for emotion. This last paragraph gives emotion to know she can�t garden do to winter. In the winter time all of her plants die for the season. 'The, author is just saying saeng is coming back. After the snow, frosts and cold weather is gone Saeng will come next season so she can continue with her gardening, plants and soil. As said �I will take the test again"" saeng.  Meaning saeng will come back and take the test of effort with her gardening and her mother next time/ next season when her starts to grow again."	1	1		1																					
1802	4	I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden. Without no friends just let in her mom	1	1		1																					
1806	4	I think that the story came back to this because that is what the story starts off with. It all started with Saeng going to take a test but she did not pass it. So when the weather is better she would have a batter time trying to pass that test. This is way I think she came back that the test.	1	1		1																					
1810	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because these geese coming back symbolize Saeng�s determination and hope that she needs to pass the driving test. She will wait for the winter to pass so that she can pass the test. The coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth. Saeng will have the chance again to pass the driving test with renewed faith and encouragement. This is a great way to end the story because it is really deep and makes the reader think about the meaning of the scene and how the geese, hibiscus plant, and spring arriving effect the conclusion of the story.	3	2		3																					
1816	4	The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because he figures after all that has happened like she failed the test he wanted to end to be remembered is a happy thing. Also wanted the end to show how something bad happened but  next she was going to do it again. The author wanted to show that she wouldn�t give up, she goes after what she wants. And he wanted that to be the last pharagraph.	1	1		1																					
1817	4	The author concludes the story the way that they did to signify that the girl will not give up trying to pass her test and will adapt to her new found home and make it what her home in Vietnam was to her. The girl is remeniscent of her past life and wishes to go back and have the life she had in her home country. When she is  	1	1		1																					
1824	4	The authoR concludes thEy stoRy with thE paRagraph bEcause in thE bEing oF the stoRy heR Family movEd to thE United States from Vietnam. Saeng was walking home FRom Failing heR dRivER's test.

1827	4	I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country. This is a good way to leave off the story because you don�t know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I also tink this is a good way to leave it off because he could write a sequal to it and make a series out of it.	1	1		1																					
1828	4	The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nices thing around.	0	0		0																					
1835	4	I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test. For example when she said, �When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
1839	4	She will try gardning again after the geese and flowers return. She wants to have the best garden around. She wants to keep the tradition going.	0	0		0																					
1840	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause. Saeng didn�t think the winter hibiscus was In the ground now and that when she got back all of her plants was gone do to the snow so she said she will take that test again meaning she will start back to the first steps of her plants and flowers.	0	0		0																					
1858	4	The author of this essay includes those sentences as the conclusion to make it that she will realize that they are coming back.	0	0		0																					
1859	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow�� to show that Saeng got stronger. She got, stronger because she adjusted to her new home and new environment. Saeng is more confident in herself to take the test again. She doesn�t want to cry again, like she did in her last test. Being more confident and more adjusted is the reason why she has become stronger, and the reason why she wants to take the test again is because she is stronger.	2	2		2																					
1861	4	Because withe the blooming of the hibiscuse plant comes new hope. In the story she sees the hibiscuse as her old life and with the budding of the plant starts a new chapter in the young girls life.	1	1		1																					
1863	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he or she wants to show Saeng is determined to not fail that drivers test. The author wants to leave Saeng on a good note so she wont be sad. When she takes the test again shell be better prepared and know what shes expecting. Shell have a better winter.	1	1		1																					
1868	4	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) @CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and won�t give up. �Saeng  vowed silently to herself, �I will take that test again�, Finally I think  the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how  they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, @CAPS2, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again.	2	3		3																					
1869	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the reader compare the girl to the geese and the hibiscus. The geese leave for the. winter and then come back in the spring, however the geese also show how the girl is going to come back and take the drivers test again in the spring. The hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring, this shows that winter is its weakness. Like the hibiscus the girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by remembering her homeland. The author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so you can see that the girl is like the geese and the hibiscus.	3	2		3																					
1873	4	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph. The author chose because the sentence informs you Saeng will take the test agin. In paragraph @NUM1 Saeng tell�s her mother she faild the test. So by the time spring comes around the hibiscus will start budding and Saeng will retake the test. Also the geese left the home temporally because of snow. So she sort of compares herself to the geese because she missis her home. The geese will return when the time is right, that is what the author concludes in the story�s paragraph.	2	1		2																					
1875	4	In the story �� Winter Hibiscus,�� the author concludes the story with this paragraph  for many reasons. This paragraph shows that Saeng  will not give up, she  will wait for next time  to come around to take the test. It also means she will be well prepared and will have a list  of  confidence in passing  this test. It gives the reader an idea that Saeng will not give up and she will complete the test. Her mother will be proud of her  for it and it shows Saeng will never give up. Just like when she said �let�s plant it, right now,�� T his example shows that even though Saeng had failed the the test and disapointed her mother,she will never give up and she still has hope in the plant just like how her mother has hope for Saeng.         	2	2		2																					
1879	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can not wait until spring because her plant will budd and it will remind her of her home land again. She can not wait to take the test in spring because she would have been alsole to stayed and she @MONTH1 pass the test in the spring because she did not pass it the first time she toke the test. Maybe she concluded the story with this paragraph because she @MONTH1 like the spring and she can not wait for it to come.    	1	1		1																					
1889	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 she is detarmand to pass that test and is not going to give up until she passes it.	1	1		1																					
1891	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by �Minfong Ho� she ends the story by saying, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. �I-I failed the test�. As many kids do, Saeng failed her driving test and she is crucially upset about it. nobody wants to fail at something and it is almost a humiliating experience to have failed at a test. knowing that others have already successfully passed. With the quote in the introduction paragraph, or the one in the question, it was written as a sign of symbolism. When the geese return back north, it is to show that they are ready to �start over� again or to �try again�. When the hibiscus is budding it is trying to �start life� again. Saeng seeing objects doing things over and over again empowers her to want to succeed and try again. She realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail. Minfong concludes with that quote because she understands that no matter what the obstacle, you must press forward and keep trying in order to succeed. She realizes success can only come from hard work and commitment, and that that is what makes a great, strong individual.	2	3		3																					
1892	4	The reason why the author concludes the paragraph with that sentence is because her wants to let reader know that it's not over. He wants the reader to know @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget. And also that all this will happen again.	1	1		1																					
1895	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to ensure the reader that she will say again. Also, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life it will always be something and or someone their to assure you of everything. The author also wanted the reader to feel a sence of similarity to the character meaning no matter how out of place you feel its always something you can relate to	1	1		1																					
1900	4	"I think the author concludes the sentence then they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geess and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" is that because it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese come back it will be spring, so it will be time to go back to school. I think thats the reason."	0	0		0																					
1901	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes his story with an odd ending. ��when they come back,� Saeng vowed silently to herself,�in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again.�� I believe that beyond the literal meaning the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. By failing her driver�s test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. �She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home..� I believe that this is showing that she still didn�t consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past.       	3	3		3																					
1903	4	The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningfull. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, �I will take that test again.� By use of the word will, the author shows the girls determination. She didn�t say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new begginigs. The story quotes, �when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again. This shows that in spring, the new begginig of life she will take the test. This is why I believe the author ended the story this way.	2	2		2																					
1905	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its important when she says when geese returns and this hibisus is budding then she says she will take that test again and to tell the reader when she will take that test again. Thats way its in the story.	0	0		0																					
1907	4	The last paragraph states �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.� I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to state the fact when her new home is like her old home maybe she will feel more confident and more in her place, instead of cold winter total opposite of where she use to live. The feeling of her old home, in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then she will take the test feeling at home and pass.	1	2		2																					
1908	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that�s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can�t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. �She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now�. Saeng didn�t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won�t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her. �She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" With Saeng�s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1909	4	The authour meerly states the obvious within this story of shortness. This exerpt mainly mainly means that when spring arrives she will return to the Green house or area with all the plants. When she gets there, the girllwill atempt to act the plant that grews wild in her home country and bring it to her new home.	0	0		0																					
1914	4	Saeng feels more comfirtable in the spring because it reminds her of home. She probably never experienced snow or winter before. So nothing in this time of year reminds her of home. In the spring it does because the geese return and the hibiscus grow again making everything feel like its her home again. Conferdence is what she receives when spring comes again. 	1	1		1																					
1915	4	The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with that paragraph because it sums up everything the hibiscus has given Saeng for strength and courage. Just like the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in this new country and the hibiscus helps her realize the importance in adapting to her survival in order to live happily. She can�t alway be dwelling in the past but learn to like where she lives now. Therefore, when the author writes, �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� it is a direct symbol of Saeng budding or opening her mind to the @CAPS1 ways, like learning to drive. 	2	2		2																					
1921	4	The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.	1	2		2																					
1922	4	After reading the story �Winter Hibiscus� by: Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a unique way that demonstrates a will to survive. For example in the text the author writes and explain how the plants �dok faeng-noi,� has adapted to its cold environment is different to the ones back at home. This demonstrates the idea of survival be the fact that in the past this plant migrated to a place that seemed warm at the time, but when cold streets, it found ways to change itself and adapt all based on the instinct to survive. Another example in the text is the author     Saeng telling herself that in the spring she will try and take the test again. This demonstrates the will to survive because when Saeng failed the test she felt a sense of meloncoly and failure. The fact that she had the courage to prepare for the test in spring shows how she human being wants to live and for her to live in a new country she must adapt by passing that test to become a survivor.	2	3		3																					
1924	4	In the story � Winter Hibiscus � Saeng vowes to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding. then I will take the test again. The author concludes   with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings her comfort from home and confidence. �Almost  familiar to her now.� This quote from the story shows that things are starting to be right and she is starting to feel comforting her by making her relize that where she is living now can be similar to where she used to live. When around the hibiscus it brings back memorys of the flowers that   they used to have where they lived. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home. For example, in the story the mother says �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here.� This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclution the author concludes this story with that paragraph because it helps readers to understand the importance of the  girls memory of where she used to live.	2	3		3																					
1935	4	The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months. Meaning she�ll survive also. Although the flower isn�t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she�ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     	2	2		2																					
1940	4	The author concludes the story with this because the season is ending and also the story is ending.	0	0		0																					
1946	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng will be ready to take the test in time. She first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings. Just like the hibiscus flower and the geese. The hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store The geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter. Saeng needs to still learn more and adapt before she can pass her drivers test. By ending the story with this paragraph it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do. She needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country.	2	2		2																					
1950	4	So she did not forget to take the test again.	0	1		1																					
1955	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� the author concludes the story the way he does to show that Saeng isn�t giving up. In the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick. �Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work.� This quote shows that when she sees familiar plants she is reminded of home, so in the spring when her plant blooms she will see it and feel more comforting and more at home which will help her find the strength to pass the driving test. So as the plant blooms, so does her comfort level.	2	1		2																					
1959	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is more will power because she loves the hibiscus and what other way to end the story that have her comparing he self to the hibiscus because when she say  �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is is saying now this snow is slowing down the hibiscus. So the fail is slowing her down. So she is going to be reading to prepare for when the spring comes when the hibiscus is budding then she will be budding too by passing her test.	1	2		2																					
1960	4	  In the article the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to herself that �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is bidding, then I will take that test again� because the spring and the hibiscus reminds her of home. For example in the article she gets shaky because she cant say home because she misses it too much. So she finds things that reminds her of it like a plant called dok faeng-noi. It�s not the real plant but she gets it to remind her where she comes from. In conclusion, Saeng finds a plant, she likes the soring because it reminds her home. How about what reminds you of home. Think about it.	2	2		2																					
1964	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it's important to the story. Also it closes the story up. Its exploning that the girl is starting to adjust to the new area, and is going to try harder to get along well there. So by saying shes going to take the test again. It means shes going to look at it in a new way. The authur put this at the end trying to make sense of everything and show the girl had changed.	1	1		1																					
1971	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that while this particular tale is over Saeng�s life will continue. The paragraph provides closure for the reader as well as explains that in time Saeng will take the test again, once she has further adapted to @LOCATION1 culture.	1	1		1																					
1973	4	In the response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because this story was about a plant growing back every year around the same time. The paragraph ment like I think when the plant came back inspring & the geese would come back around it be another test of growing and not letting the plant die	0	0		0																					
1975	4	Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past.	2	2		2																					
1978	4	The author concludes the �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph to show the narrator realizes that even though she�s in a new country, some things are still the same. So she becomes determined to pass the test. For example, the narrator said, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of are strange before had become, through the quick repetition of season upon season familiar to her now.�  This quote shows that the narrator has realized that even though aspects of how life has changed, some things remain same. This also shows that some things like the test were strange to her but now that she is familiar with it she could pass it. The narrator also said, �Saeng did not dare look at her mother in her eyes.� This quote shows that the narrator was disappointed with herself for not passing the test. This means that the test was very important to her with the  of pressure to pass, and of a new is ready to pass the test. But she�ll be more prepared. The theme of this story could be seen things discourage you. The narrator has gone through recently many but in the seasons.	3	2		3																					
1979	4	The author shows a willingness to try harder in this story. She states that, �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author realizes that she is going to have to adapt. Also, saying that she will wait till the spring, means she is going to try again, and not give up. The author has a sentimental value to. Insince she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud, I believe she is referring that hibiscus to her country. Insince she has left her country, the hibiscus is the closet thing she has to it, and therefore, she will wait with the flower	2	2		2																					
1983	4	I think the auther concludes the story with the paragraph because it is saying I�ll never give up. She is determined to concor everything. I think she is saying she will take the test over and over until she succeeds. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because you should never give up.	1	1		1																					
1986	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform what her hole meaning was. For example when she returned she felt great b/c she came back to were she belonged. One reason is what she �vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.� @CAPS1 meant that coming back was probably the best thing she could had done.	1	1		1																					
1995	4	"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don�t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."	2	3		3																					
1996	4	The last paragraph of the �Winter Hibiscus� reads �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author ends with this statement to let the reader know that Saeng has hope and will continue to adjust to her new settling in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 the story, Saeng realizes that she is not as distant from her home in Vietnam as she believes. In the florists shops she sees �plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood worth. �The plants she grew up with exist in the @LOCATION2 as well. She fails �the test� by buying a winter hibiscus after breaking down crying, homesick. By the end of the story she recognizes that she is becoming more accustomed to her new life, which is �almost familiar to her now,� such as the geese flying overhead. The statement of the last paragraph means that by the spring, she hopes to no longer be homesick, and to think of the @LOCATION2 with its geese and winter hibiscuses as her home.	2	2		2																					
1997	4	The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. �the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is �strong enough to make it through the cold months that�s what matters.� This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming �familiar�. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it�s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   	3	3		3																					
2004	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 the carter Saeng want to finish or @CAPS2 Take the Test agin when they come back and and also the author is @CAPS3 people @CAPS4't give up what you are doing with your self then she say that ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding Then I will take that test agin"" she means that she will not give up at all."	1	1		1																					
2005	4	The author ended the story with that sentence because in the spring Saeng is going retake the test and her hibiscus will finally be budding. Saeng is going to retake the test because she failed it the @CAPS1 time she took. That is why the author put that sentence at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2009	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of �Winter Hibiscus� means and this is why the author concluded it this way.	1	1		1																					
2012	4	Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author uses the conclusion �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says �and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went� It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn�t pass her test she doesn�t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  	2	2		2																					
2017	4	The author uses this paragraph because it brings back memories from when Saeng put down the soil during the �winter hibiscus� and a flock of Canada geese flew by her. When Saeng failed her test the first time she did not dare look at her mother. She depended on the hibiscus which helped or want to retake the test but not until they re-bud again.	1	1		1																					
2024	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test.	3	3		3																					
2026	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about retaking the test to show that Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and even the smallest of things can hold memories for us. The paragraph shows Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2 by showing us that she isn�t going to give up on @LOCATION2 and that she will keep working at understanding our customs. The last paragraph also shows that our memories last forever by the hibiscus representing Vietnam and her home there. It also shows that she can start a new here just like the hibiscus does at her house. Finally the paragraph shows that even the smallest of things can hold our memories by the hibiscus representing her home in Vietnam. The hibiscus brings many memories back for Saeng and helps her cope with @LOCATION2. This is how the last paragraph shows us that Saeng is getting used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and the smallest things can hold memories.	2	2		2																					
2032	4	I think the author concludes the Story with that statement becauses, the snow doesn�t melt in the spring geese don�t return in the winter and the hibiscus is not budding til spring either. The hibiscus is a beautiful plants Saeng loved this plant.    	0	0		0																					
2036	4	When the snow melts & the geese return then mean its almost spring.	0	0		0																					
2038	4	The author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because she wants to show the courage the girl has in immigrating to @LOCATION1. After having failed her drivers test Saeng was feeling deafeted and worthless. Her mother took into concideration and didn�t get mad at her for buying the flower. In fact she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that everything would work out in the end. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this she became overwhelmed with determination and took over planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis. Saeng�s mother was out in the cold planting and trying to make the best of her situation. By setting this example Saeng realized that she too could make the best out of her situation. This is why in the end Saeng decides to take her drivers test again, and ultimatly live with the same attitude her mother has.    	3	2		3																					
2050	4	The author most likely concludes this story with the quote because she has renewed hope. She was feeling really upset because she had failed the driving test and when she saw the hibiscus flower, she got even more emotional because she misses her home but when she sees the geese as she finishes planting the flower, she decides she�s going to try to retake the test next spring.	2	1		2																					
2053	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, author ends the story with �When they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show that Saeng is ready to adapt, but still needs time. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with overcoming moving from her home, to an unfamiliar place hundreds of miles away. However, Saeng still isn�t ready to let go of her home yet. So she tries to hang on to her old memories, only to that in @LOCATION1, everything is different. When she buys a familiar plant to her, she realizes that even it is different in @LOCATION1, and gets angry that nit isn�t what she expected. However, at the end of the story she realizes that different isn�t always so bad, and vows to try to accept this new culture, but nows that it will still take a long time before she is ready to fully do so.	3	2		3																					
2054	4	The author concludes the story with that ending paragraph like that because when the spring comes back she going to try again. When I was reading this story it�s says in the story that her mother had asked her �What happened.� And the Saeng said �I- I failed the test�. So I am predicting that her mother is going to help her more with her studying and with her gardening. When the snow melts and Saeng vowed to herself that this time she work harder and past the test.	1	1		1																					
2059	4	"The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the show melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because Saeng failed the test before and now she wants to pass the test. She learned a lot from her mother that day that completely changed her attitude towards life."	1	1		1																					
2064	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to say whenever something leaves their home they always come back. The hibiscus reminds her of home and that is where she wants to go. Saeng had failed her drivers test and she said when the geese come back I will do it again. The plant reminds her of home but its, �Not like the tird we had before� (Ho). She is trying to say that the ones over at Vietnam are better and she wants to go back because she misses it.	1	1		1																					
2065	4	"Saeng is talking about flowers coming back in the spring time. She is vowing to take the test again after the snow is gone and she is going to do it agin. �The wind was blowing harder, tearing of the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing."" So she cant wait until it is spring agin. So she can try to plant agin."	0	0		0																					
2069	4	In the story �winter Hibiscus,� the author included important part at the end that saeng vowed. The reason why she said that is because when everything in her life starts up again she will love her life again, she will be alot happier person.	1	1		1																					
2071	4	I believe that the author chose to end with that paragraph because the paragraph represents new beginnings and starting over. When Saeng fails her driving test she has a moment of weakness, she feels lonely and then she sees a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam. In a since, the plant comforts her. �it�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here� In this quote Saeng�s mother tells her that the flower is too, out of place but yet has found the courage and determination to still grow. In the closing paragraph Saeng decides that, like the flower and the birds, she can also find the coarge to face fears. She deciedes to retake the tests.	2	2		2																					
2077	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they come back, saeng vowed Silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, to show that even though she failed her test she isn�t giving up and that she will persevere over this and continue to try. This ending shows the determination in Saeng�s heart. Saeng has enough determination inside of her to go on even though she failed her test and failed her grandmother to continue trying and continue to try to complete for her grandmother and herself. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story.	1	1		1																					
2078	4	Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, �� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. 	2	2		2																					
2079	4	In the story the author concludes the story in his last paragraph because he showes that even in her hardships. Saeng goes on and keeps trying to live a normal life after she had to move. For example when it says, �Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring I will take the test again.� This shows that even after one failuare you should never give up but don`t forget the past.	1	1		1																					
2082	4	In the story �winter hibiscus �by @CAPS1 Ho the storey ends with Saeng promising herself that she will take the test again in the spring. The author most likely ends this way because it shows how Saeng is getting over her sorrow test in the spring when the Hibiscus is in @LOCATION1. This is shown when Saeng says �I-I failed the test (@NUM1) this shows @CAPS2 leaving her homeland and makes her even more so sad, but she then promises herself that in the spring when flowers @LOCATION1 she will try again. She does this when she says to herself ��in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�(pg @NUM2) this shows her getting over her sorrow and becoming determined and looking forward and taking the test again.	2	2		2																					
2090	4	The author uses this sentence to conclude the story to show that Saeng�s hope is restored. Throughout the story Saeng is sad and misses her home. She feels hopeless in this new land, the hibiscus reminds her of home and brings back memories of her being at home with her grandmother, which makes her want to be back at home. The author adds the part about the geese leaving because they also have to leave their home. The hibiscus is to symbolize her being strong and that she will make it through moving to just strange land.	2	2		2																					
2106	4	The concludes the sentence this way because their trying to show that Saeng is a very deterimined girl and no matter how many times she fails, she always trys again and again tell she gets it right. By doing this the author is showing what Saeng believes in and that is no matter how big or hard the chanellge is she will keep on going tell she is done what she started. Because moving was a very hard for her. She had a very hard time communicating with peolpe and just tyring to make friends cause it is not always easy be new, by moving she took a another look at things because they were different on her. But as time went by she got the hang of it so as long as you try you can be successful in it that�s what the author was trying to say by concluding it the way it was.	2	2		2																					
2110	4	"Minfong who concludes "" Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph because it show @CAPS1's determination to succed in her new country despite the obstacles she faces. The winter hibiscus reminds Saeng to be strong like the hibiscus in is to endure winter or in Saeng's case to pass the driving test the text states ""....but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus ....""(Ho @NUM1). Saeng realizes she must also be ""strong"" lkie the ""winter hibiscus"" Saeng also realizes that she is beginning to adopt to the new country he wrote ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had though strange before had become almost familiar...""(Ho @NUM1).Saeng knows that she is able to adopt and is determined to succeed. Tthe author conclude.""..in the spring, the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho @NUM1) The ""spring "" will be Saeng's"	2	3		3																					
2117	4	Saeng believes that because she failed the driving test that she won�t be able the transition by a new country had she goes searching for her past. She finds her past in plants remembering Vietnam in deep sorrow. The narration states  �A were of less so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eye��(No) She remembers and misses everything she had she wanted her country her grandmother and her life. She came home to her mother with a plant and disappoint her mother with the cost but she understands the pain. The narration states �it�s a beautiful plant she finally said in sad you got it�(No). Eventually Saeng realizes how this plant affected her and how easily it survived and made a promise to herself. The narration states �and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agin   	2	3		3																					
2121	4	"Mingfong Ho concludes �Winter Hibiscus� with the paragraph,�when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending paragraph shows that Saeng will not give up in her struggle to adapt in this new place. Saeng has been going throug hard times; moving to the United States and failing her driver�s test. In the greenhouse Saeng even breaks down and crys. The hibiscus flower that saeng bought cost the family a lot of money, but to Saeng it was very important. This flower represented hope. When the flower buds again it would be the right time to take her driver�s test. The flower also represents adapting to a new place. As Saeng  adapts to the United States, the hibiscus adapts to the new garden. "	2	3		3																					
2124	4	The Author concludes this story with that paragraph because she is saying that she could not concentrate on the test because she wanted to go back to her home country.	1	1		1																					
2129	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Forexample, It gives the Story a good and happe ending.	1	1		1																					
2138	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because show that she will go back to the one place and will not break down like that and grif over what she has lost and have to deal with change.	1	1		1																					
2141	4	The author concludes this paragraph with the story because of the potintal of the hibiscus. So Saeng will go take the test again no matter she already took it and failed. She is like the hibiscuc. The hibiscus seems out of place and is determined to survive when the snow melts. So she will go take the test again and us the hibiscus as her modifation.	2	1		2																					
2142	4	The author had concluded the story with the paragraph When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because the author wanted the reader to notice how the mother and the child bond with gardening. Between the different things that author has said about Saeng and Saeng�s mother. He as in the author shows a way they have bonded they being Saeng and Saeng�s mother which I think it was fairly neat they way the author had bid out this story. It was a fairly interesting story to it kept you guessing, on the end of year seat, wondering. But I enjoyed reading that story. I had also liked how the daughter and mother were so great friends. But it was a nice thing to see with the daughter and the mother being so in touch with each other. Also, in doing this the author has shown some of his ways of thinking. The author shows us he a great mind and a good way thinking. This author is telling us a great story of a girl and her mother it sounded very good to me. This story is a gardening story of a daughter and her mom moving from Vietnam and moving to the @ORGANIZATION1 to live out the rest of their lives.	1	1		1																					
2146	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to leave us with hope. Saeng is going to retake the test she failed. Saeng is having a hard time adjusting to her new life, by waiting until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, Saeng gives herself time to adapt and heal. The paragraph show�s Saeng�s courage and hope about retaking the test.	1	1		1																					
2147	4	Honestly I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she fees assured now. Maybe its a mental trial we all must face. Maybe the geese returning and the plant budding is a metaphoric test too.	1	1		1																					
2152	4	She wanted to catch them, that was her whole goal and purpose of hunting.  Trying to catch geese. She saw her grandparents try to do it. In conclusion this is why she made that last statement.	0	0		0																					
2155	4	In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  	3	3		3																					
2160	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. because she wants to make a goal for herself in the future. She wants to pass the test, and she will try hard to do it next year. For example, her mother was mad she didn�t pass the test, but then soon forget about it. Saeng did not forget about failing the test. She vowed herself to the hibiscus because she loves that plant and will do anything for it.	1	1		1																					
2167	4	The author might conclude the story with this because it shows that the girl had confidence that when the flower blooms she will be able to pass. Back at her home land that flower mean't alot to her and it still does. But it seems like this flower gives her hope and pride. She used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair. So when she sees the flower, she will think of her grandmother and that will motivate her to keep going. The flower is strong and can stand through winter weather, so the girl is determinded that when the flower blooms, she will be able to past the test.	2	3		3																					
2173	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, ends by, �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author concludes that story with that quote because the author sees spring as a new beginning. The author knows to work hard and needs to starts over. For example, some students fail the second semester and look at winter as a new start.	1	1		1																					
2176	4	The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because the story is coming to and end. The author putting that sweet touch on its saying it will become string again and the beautiful flowers will blossom. Letting the readers know that the nature will continue, The season will come back around.	0	0		0																					
2187	4	I think the author used that response because she was showing that she had to go through another @DATE1 or hard work in planting flowers.	0	0		0																					
2189	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese. I think that her test is in school but she has believe that she�ll pass it by remembering her memories she fells conected to the outside ness. For example, she loves flowers. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2190	4	"The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", with a very spiritual and confident paragraph to show that hope has an important part in our lives. In the story, �Saeng"", a foreign chinese citizen, is touched and flattened by all the majestic plants and nature that was living in the green house. She ventures to find all the plants that remind her of home and to relate them to her past experiences. As she walks through the green house, she whispers and pronounces the names of the nature she sees, �Saebba"", Saeng whispered, �Madagascar periwinkle�, its tag pronounced. �How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild.!! But as her tour grew with time, she soon relizes she is missing some of her memories, and begins to cry. As she reaches home she is greeted by her mother. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. Saeng's mother is touched by her comment, and cheers her up with planting the �hibiscus"". In the end, the author shows strong expression by writting one last paragraph to bring out hope, and emotion, to represent that everyone deserves a second chance."	3	2		3																					
2203	4	The author concludes the story with When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because the hibiscus budding would symbolize starting over and Saeng taking the test again is giving her a chance to start over fresh and try again. The hibiscus doesn�t stop budding so Saeng shouldn�t stop trying!	2	1		2																					
2205	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has �tear stains and puffy eyes� as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test.	2	2		2																					
2207	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things	0	0		0																					
2214	4	I think that the auther end the story Like that as a meterphor For people to think out side the @CAPS1 or thing. OR The auther might oF ended it Like that so people can get a picture in the head about what she was talking about.	0	0		0																					
2219	4	The author concludes the story the way he or she dose because it shows that the time she found the plant that she will get her lisens So it is a reminder for her. I also think she did it that way because when the plant blooms it starts over and so when she sets on gose to take a chance at the test she is starting new	1	1		1																					
2221	4	The author concludes the story with this ending paragraph because. It combine the two inpefect situations. When she said when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the gese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take test again. She will prove her point and abbreviated the situation.	0	0		0																					
2222	4	The author is saying that she would take the test again in the spring instead of the winter cause she would be more focus to just keep her mind on the test & not the planting.	0	0		0																					
2223	4	I think she ended the story with that because throout the wole story she trys to work hard. And this last sentence is saying that its not over, That she will be back to take the test again. She trys to prove herself during the whole book. And she will continue working hard to get what she wants  	1	1		1																					
2224	4	In the story the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric, I say this because she is comporing herself to the hibiscus plant. As a hibiscus would be tested to over come conditions such as the cold and forexample in the test the author states � its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus�. She as the hibiscus will bloom again and have to pass the test of surviving the cold, will be able to have a chance to pass her own test, that is why the author concludes the story as she did.	2	2		2																					
2232	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the growth or hope that Saeng has that she will be comfortable in the United States. When she said “I-I failed the test,” I took it as failing the test to see if she got over her country and if   	1	1		1																					
2234	4	Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower.	1	2		2																					
2247	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph why @CAPS1 it might be important to the author about Saeng. It some thing personely about her past or where she had came for. She trying to say that when she come back in the spring she going to take the test again in school. OR She is going to plants something over again the spring @CAPS1. As snow @CAPS2 and its too cold to plant any thing. That where she came from is really important to her and she miss it and went to go back to where she Come from. 	1	1		1																					
2252	4	"Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. when saeng saw the hibiscus she got a feeling ""so intense, it was almost visceral.� The flower was creatively used by Ho. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph, that this flower must give saeng hope and confidence. Also, the geese make a V which I infured would mean Vietnam to saeng which is what the author is trying to get her reader to think. That is why �and the geese return.� is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants her readers to realize that objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author did a great job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the lesson, and that is that you should do things when you feel confident and it feels like home to you. You @MONTH1 be small and fragile, but if you �plant� yourself you can thrive with confidence. "	2	3		3																					
2253	4	The last paragraph at the end of the story was the authors way of showing how Saeng wanted spring to come early because she wants to see her hibiscus. If spring doesn�t come fast she will not get to see her hibiscus and the snow won�t melt. When Saeng comes up she hopes she can take the test.	1	1		1																					
2254	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn�t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."	2	2		2																					
2257	4	The author concludes with with paragraph because Saeng has to take the test all over. She @MONTH1 think theres a better chance when it blooms and the snow melts. So that is when Saeng is going to try and take the test after the snow melts and the hibiscus blooms	1	1		1																					
2258	4	The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can�t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2262	4	The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.	2	2		2																					
2263	4	the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng�s mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2267	4	The author include it because her mother took the test and passed it and the daughter wanted to do the same Just like her mom. And she can only take it in the spring because there is no flowers out in the winter.	0	0		0																					
2276	4	Saeng cares about the flowers. She cares about the flower. Natural occurrence with them growing unique.	0	0		0																					
2278	4	Why the author concludes this paragraph into the story is because at the end off the story they needed and ending. Also why is because the picked and conclusion that would best fit this story.	0	0		0																					
2280	4	I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,� In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .� mean that when all is @CAPS1 .� She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don�t even know what she  failed  so I didn�t  like it.	1	1		1																					
2282	4	"Emotion, camitmint, hope, all are reasons why the author ended the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the gees return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1, that last paragraph shows that she has emotion. Next, It shows that she has comitmint, she says that when the hibiscus coms back she will take the test again. Lastly, it shows that there is hope and the she will try and redeam herself. These are all the reasons why she used the last paragraph."	2	1		2																					
2283	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, �she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her.� At this point she has an epiphany, and realizes that life is like seasons. In the end paragraph she intercedes this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times. One day her time will come for her to �bloom.� @CAPS1 experiences hard times, but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to �bloom.� 	3	2		3																					
2284	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because, he wanted to show that she wasn�t going to give up just because she failed one time. She failed the test one time already. She was very sad about it. She went and bought a plant. Saeng�s mom told her that they were going to do it the right way. Saeng was crying when she told her mom about it. Her mom was very understanding thought. Her  mom could have been very mad with her. She could of used a plant that they grew. The plant @MONTH1 not grow right now. She should of bought a real plant from someone else.	1	1		1																					
2287	4	The reason why the author puts that last line into the story of the end is to show us the raids  and saeng  that even though us almost over. She doesn�t want  it to end but she know that it will also start up again. Next year when things goes back to the way they were before everything changed. This is why I think the author put that line into the story.	0	0		0																					
2288	4	The author concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again� to express her determination of fitting into new things and to express the change she was getting used to. Describing spring was important in the conclusion because it described what Saeng once thought was odd in @LOCATION1, but got used to the seasons and weather changing. Once she realized that she needed to deal with change, she knew that she would need to try the driving test again. It was very important that the author�s conclusion was �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because it expressed how Saeng was accepting change in her life.  	2	2		2																					
2296	4	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold so she would wait until the snow melts and geese return to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother.	0	0		0																					
2298	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you�ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way.	2	2		2																					
2312	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story to show saeng determination and her adaption to her new home. This shows her determination because it say �I will take that test again."" This also shows that she has adapt to her new home."	1	1		1																					
2314	4	"In the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph with Saeng vowing she will take the test again in the spring. Minfong used this paragraph because it means never give up, even if you fail the first time. For example, Saeng just failed her drivers test but after buying the Hibiscus and taking deeper into things she realized she shouldn�t give up."	1	2		2																					
2315	4	The author concludes with this sentence for emphasis. It takes Saeng�s mind off of the flower and she focuses on her test. By waiting until next spring to take the test it gives her something to look forward to. This statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do. The author ends on a good note explaining this, The last paragraph is also a break from the rest of the story and from what Saeng�s was just doing. It is Saeng�s last and final thoughts.	2	2		2																					
2317	4	The author concludes the story with a paragraph so the people reading the story would actually read it and not guess how the story is goin to go.	0	0		0																					
2332	4	From the story of the girl just moved from Vietnam to United @ORGANIZATION1. It will be hard for the girl to understand anything and anything can bring her memory back about Vietnam. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she did fail the test and see wants to see the hibiscus is budding. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said it to her mother. Her mother actually understand why it happen and she will let Saeng keep the hibiscus because it will make Saeng feel better. Saeng miss Vietnam a lot and will like to try her best to overcome obstacles.	2	2		2																					
2335	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, Ho concludes the story with the paragraph due to the fact the flower represents her hapiness from her home. The flower symbolizes the past and comfort, once Saeng began to dig the ""winter hibiscus"" In, ""she could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now,"" All of Saeng�s sense were beginning to return; she was happy, likewise, the author uses the geese to explain the comfort of Saeng. The country around her began to feel like home. She became familiar with her surroundings. Many references to home was made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness. therefore, Saeng would gain more confidence, which explans the reason @CAPS1 Ho concluded with that sentence."	3	2		3																					
2342	4	I think that the concluding paragraph means after everything   else   important and what is meant to happen happens then she will take the test because its  basically the last  thing has to happen and I think she will pass it because it meant to happen.	1	1		1																					
2346	4	By this quote, the author is explaining that Saeng will eventually be ready for her test. When the geese return, they're ready to return From their migration and when the hibiscus is budding, it is ready to turn into a beautiful flower. Saeng believes that in the spring, since the flower and the geese are ready, she too will be ready.	2	1		2																					
2351	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show saeng�s determination to survive and be happy in her new home. Although she isn�t happy with her purchase she is trying to make it seem more homey. When  she says �will take that test again�she shows how she wants her surroundings to be comfortable. By ending with this paragraph it also shows a strongness in seasons. As it saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring. This paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends. The  plant is like a symbol of how she is going to change she is going to investigate and pass her own test proving she diserves to be happy and make herself feel at home.	2	2		2																					
2352	4	The author concluded this paragraph in the story because it was showing that there are geese that hang around the garden around the spring time.	0	0		0																					
2353	4	The author in this story explaynes how hard some changes can be. The author also explayns how family and object frome home such as the flower can be comforting. The meaning of the story is to show one of the author expierances in life.	1	1		1																					
2354	4	I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it wasn�t it for the little girl and she wasn�t going to give up on planting flower and that when the spring come and the snow had melt she was going to plant some more flower and see how they will do during the spring even though that it didn�t work as well as the winter season she did let her stop her I think the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesn�t work keep on trying maybe something different will happen.	0	0		0																					
2357	4	The author concludes the story with this because she failed the test already and wanted to pass it nexttime So she doesn't make her mother dissapointed in her.	1	1		1																					
2363	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story. In the my opinion the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story in order to show Saeng is committed to adjusting  to her new home and to leaving her old one. For example, in the story Saeng was unable to say �I mean, not like the kind we had at home.� without bursting into tears. This illustrates her sorrow and inability to let go of her past.	1	2		2																					
2380	4	Now that she knows a lot about plants the narrator makes it seem like the girl is interested in @CAPS1.R.@CAPS1. The new world and different plants that bloom and look so beautiful in the season so the way I see it is that the girl really enjoys the plants and the characteristic to me I say she is an adventurous girl who likes to explore new worlds and see what is out there to be explained.	0	0		0																					
2386	4	I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  	1	1		1																					
2389	4	Memory,promise,life-all are ideas that explain why the author concludes the  story with this paragraph.Memories is one  idea that helps explain why the author concludes this story  with  this paragraph because saeng misses her old life and country.Promise is another idea because saeng makes a vow that once spring comes again she will take the test again.Life is another idea because saeng brought the flower and planted soit can live once spring has come and she said  the n she will  retake the test. Memories, promise, and life help explain why the author conclude the story with this paragraph. Memories will come back in the spring along with the promises she has made and the that wants to start and saeng is doing this by pla nting the hibiscus which brings back a lot of her memories from her life	2	2		2																					
2400	4	Saeng and her mother have to be determined to try their best in order to survive. Saeng and her mother has been thourgh a lot and when she failed the @CAPS1 test, she was more depressed than before, The author concludes this story with this paragraph to give readers the thought oF how it is to be determined to adapt and survive in a different place and though Saeng and her mother are away from their homeland they still enjoy the things they did in Vietnam, like the flowers, and the hot peppers and bitter melons, her friends disagree with the taste but it doesnt stop her from enjoying what she loves most.	2	2		2																					
2404	4	he was saying that you should not give up and that you should keep trying like the plants in the spring time.	1	1		1																					
2405	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself.	1	1		1																					
2411	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because that paragraph says when she is going to try to take the test and make changes in her changing life. For example she is sad in the story because she failed the test and want to go home. If she passes in the spring she might try to make changes and live here. This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2414	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show Saeng�s determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when she�s in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, �It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.�	2	2		2																					
2423	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. ��in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words.	2	2		2																					
2426	4	The author wrote the paragraph because she went back in side the house to get a dinner and because ain�t going to see the garden until the other day and because the winter come and she will not play outside anymore until the winter goes. Like she said �In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. That quotation explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2431	4	It is actually a very powerful last statement, Even though she failed her driver�s test, she has realized that she will just have to keep being strong and be patient. Soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt, and she will �return� to take her test and will  be determined to pass. Saeng  bought the hibiscus to feel as if she were back in Vietnam, and felt as if it could fill that place in her heart were she misses it. �I paid nineteen dollars for  it�. She  says it like she was disappointed  in failing the  test but also that saying which is free back in vietnam was so expensive in the united states. A hibiscus flower is tropical so when it blooms in the spring will be when she becomes ready to give the test a second try.	3	2		3																					
2434	4	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that�s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story	1	1		1																					
2438	4	"The story �Winter Hibiscus� is written by Minfong Ho. The author ended the story with this excerpt, �When they come back, �Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The reason for this is so she will have time to adjust. Saeng just needs a little comforting because all of this is new to her. This words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself, �Almost familiar to her now. Like geese.""  "	2	1		2																					
2442	4	The author concludes the story this way to show she will be alright, and remain determined. The way she speaks of future times shows confidence that she will make it till spring. The way she speaks of the test shows her determination. The use of the word �vowed� shows she will follow through with her statement.	1	1		1																					
2447	4	The author concludes with this ending because it because it gives hope. It is like a happy ending to a sad story. It is also her final thought for the story and a good end point.	1	1		1																					
2450	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes. Saeng vowed silently to herself. That shows she calm down already, she feels better with her new country. She feels the snows meet, the geese return, she says that she will take that test again. It shows one that she doesn�t feel bad with the test more. She knows that she has opportunity to take it again and does it better. She has a different feeling with her problem. She looks her new country with a different eyes. All things with her become better. These are some reasons explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph.	2	1		2																					
2453	4	"The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because it appeared to be an important thought to ""Saeng"" and it was basically the main cause of everything rather the main subject of the story. She also @MONTH1 possibly have concluded the story with that particular paragraph because that was her last and final thought, or memory of her previous life / lifestyle before there present place of living."""	0	0		0																					
2455	4	 I believe that author ended the story with that sentence because it give a lifting feeling after the story was so sad. Saeng missed her homeland, was sad, used the flowers as relief, sad about her driving test and realy liked the plant. So the last sentence seemed to fit in as a confort zone to make the reader a bit more relieved. 	1	1		1																					
2457	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� ends the story with this paragraph because it reveals the importance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the story Saeng moves from Vietnam and feels very homesick. She fails her drivers test and is very upset. When she sees the familiar plant she is reminded of her home in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus reminds Saeng of fond memories with her grandmother and simple things such as her fine. Toothed buffalo-horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water. When seeing the familiar plant. �Saeng felt a shock recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. �This shows how important the hibiscus was to her. The author ended the story with that paragraph to show how the winter hibiscus is a comfort to Saeng and will encourage her to do better on her next driver�s test.	2	2		2																					
2464	4	 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time.	1	1		1																					
2467	4	The author ends with this paragraph to show gthat Saeng had. Hope. It shows that there is still hope. The ending paragraph makes you  kind of create your own ending for Saeng. I like to imagine Saeng with a big garden next to her and and she passes the test.	1	1		1																					
2469	4	The author concludes the story the way she does because it shows that Saeng   needs to heal from the failing of the test before she can take it again. Saeng already knows that she  can heal. She realizes that she has gotten used to where she now lives, that things in her new land, like the sound of geese, are now �familiar to her�. The narrator of the story says, �..she  realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� almost familiar to her now.� Things in Saeng new home had been strange to her at first, but she had healed and gotten used to them. Saeng has also healed from leaving her original home of Vietnam. She was sad to leave her home, � A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.�, but she had healed. Saeng  remembers the flowers that she had known in vietnam as �old friends�, showing that it did not hurt her to remember them. When Saeng heals from failing   her driving test, like she had healed when moving  from Vietnam to the united states, she can re-visit the test, without pain.	3	3		3																					
2475	4	"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus�. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says �In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again�. This shows Saeng�s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng�s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."	2	2		2																					
2479	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things from her home and living, it will comfort her in what she does. The author seems like she needs things from her homeland that help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of earlier life. I think that whenever I want to do a good job It helps to think of the good  things that mean alot to me so I will be happy and want to do good. The author is smart to want to see those things for her to retake her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again it will be good luck for her.	2	2		2																					
2484	4	The  last  paragraph of the story.� Winter Hibiscus by Minfong  Ho is important to the story. The last paragraph leaves a definite ending so the  reader  knows  exactly what is going to happen  in the future.  This  paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represent s symbols in the story. The author concludes the hibiscus is important to her. Along with the hibiscus it also shows that the  geese  and the melting of the snow represent a fresh  start  and a new  beginning . These symbols  are  important  to her in that they  give  her a chance to start over and she sees that in the  winter  hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2486	4	The author concludes the story with when they come back ��to show how saeng has changed throughout the plot of the story. In the beginning she refers to her new home as, �walking into another world.� As teenager she had to move from Vietnam where traditions are so much different than in the United States. However, there is one plant that is similar, the winter Hibiscus. The plant connects her previous life and home to the life and home she lives now. It was hard to adapt to the situation of moving, but the plant created familiar scents and the �familiar fragrance �which �filled her lungs .� It was even difficult for saeng to say the words �at home� without bursting into tears. Once the winter Hibiscus was in the ground it changed saeng and she realized that she needed to appreciate what she had. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it showed how much the plant resembled saeng and how her mind set on life was altered.  	3	2		3																					
2491	4	The reason I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph was because it was a good learning story you can learn something from it .The author did that so you can get a better understanding of the of the story. It said �saeng .teenage  girl, and her family have moved to the united states of Vietnam.� So from reading that it tells me that its telling you what happen right before the story took place. So you can get a better understanding. To me its rapping it all up for you. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2492	4	I believe the author of �winter Hibiscus �ends the story like she did because saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test.  Saeng states in the story �it�s the flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, thes winte hibiscus. That�s what matters.� I think saeng is using this as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam. She plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol. She will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring.	2	1		2																					
2494	4	I the narrator this paragraph in the story because hibiscus is a valueable plant and garden is you own decision if you like to grow things like her mother grow hot pepper. Garden is a way to @CAPS1 different like the different types of foods you can plant and the different plants in the world there eg @CAPS2, lilis, and other other plants like that.	0	0		0																					
2500	4	The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to, a place where she didn�t like and knew No one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what don�t give up, have faith. At the end Saeng has faith in herself that she can past the test next time. She @MONTH1 have realized that just because your at place you don�t want to, it doesn�t mean you can�t go on.	1	2		2																					
2504	4	The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. � ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng.	1	2		2																					
2512	4	"At the end of the short start �Winter Hibiscus,� Saeng says �when they comeback, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" When she says this she is refering to her drivers test she says she will take the test again because she is reminded that her family didnt give up they moved to @LOCATION1 for a fresh start �plant she had forgotten drew her back to her childhood world. �She sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before. So she wont now other.  "	2	2		2																					
2513	4	The author is trying to convey a sense of hope for Saeng in her new country. After noting that she failed her test, which is probably a citizenship test, the author wants to conclude the story with something that reasures the reader. It is obvious that this test was important because Saeng could not even look her mother in the eye. This was probably why she bought the flower for her mother. The ending reasures the reader so that you don�t wonder how it will workout for Saeng.	1	1		1																					
2517	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" is about this girl named Saeng and her mother and grandmother. Flowers are beauitful to them they plant them all day. Picking them, @CAPS1 them. �Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye�    "	0	0		0																					
2519	4	This paragraph means when winter is over and the geese come back from the south, and she favorite plant comes back that used to be in her old country, she will try what she was trying to do before but this time she has more confidence. This is what I think this means.	1	1		1																					
2520	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sums everything up and solves the conflict of her failing her driver's test. When Saeng said ""� I will take that test again"" it showed that she is determined to pass the tes and will try again. Since the conflict is solved there you pretty much have to introduce a new conflict to keep the story going so the author just ends it. This excerpt from the last paragraph also incorporates Saeng difficultly to that geese because just as geese faces hardships getting her driver lisense. But also like the geese she will go back her face hardships again. "	1	2		2																					
2526	4	The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the samething next year.	0	0		0																					
2527	4	The author concludes the story with that because she want's to retake the test. Because she wants to pass the test for her mother. So she brought home the flower to apologize to her mother.	1	1		1																					
2528	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because everything in the story will repeat such as the season changes and you will not be able to plant nor grow in the winter. For example she talked about how the plants are nothing like her home, but she has to adapt to the fact she�s not home, & adjust to her environment. I say this because if she doesnt she will just be an unhappen person worrying about where she came from.	1	1		1																					
2543	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind because she found  a  flower that reminds her of homeland. She is afraid that her parents  are going to be mad at for not passing the test, therefore she  buys  a  flower  that she sees for it remind. When she gets home and telling her mom how much she paid for the flower  and  how  she  didn�t  pass, mother is upset for only a second, then she is understanding of what her  daughter is going throgh. By the end  of the story she has  more confidence  that  she  will succeed next time.	2	2		2																					
2545	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again. The author wants to tell the reader because she fail the test she know what she did wrong and shes going to correct. For example when Saeng said, �then I will take that test again.� Saeng feel sorry she fail a simple test so she wants to retake the test when the snow melts.	1	1		1																					
2554	4	I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens	1	1		1																					
2556	4	The Author ends the story off with that paragraph because when dealing with flowers and nature. Then are seasons  when the flowers don�t  come up like winter for example. The paragraph is saying in the spring when the winter is over she tells her self that she will look forward to seeing all the plant that nature has to give.	0	0		0																					
2564	4	She means that when she return she is going to do the same thing again and see if she will do better or not.	0	0		0																					
2569	4	By adding this paragraph to the end of the story, it show that a resolution was made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heartbroken however, after buying the hibiscus, she had found hope and motivation and decides, in the end, that she will take the test again, �in the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. Its to help move the story to a conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this. Readers are able to abtein the message as the story from paragraphs like this. In this case, the author�s message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things. It is important to know what a author is trying to tell the reader through paragraphs as not only a reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express their ideas clearly to an audience.	2	2		2																					
2574	4	"The author concluded this because she thinks this is the right time to re take the test. She adds this because the snow is melted, the hibiscus is budding, and the geese return is a perfect time because everything is back and warm. She says ""when they come back...then I will take the test again.� means she will have all confidence to take the test. Saeng voweds to take it again and she will and she thinks this time she will pass. That's what theauthor concludes this to the story."	1	1		1																					
2575	4	"The Author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope and the meaning of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story like that because spring is a time for new beginings and where everything comes back to life and starts to regrow so to say that when the snow melts and geese return. ""Its. saying its the right time for a secnd chance. I.t failed the test Saeng said.....She tore off a leaf shruddy it to pests�. that shows the dying of the hope she had or the hybisus symbolized it. So that�s why the author ended it like that b/c it shows new heqionqrys."	2	1		2																					
2579	4	In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that �why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome.	1	1		1																					
2581	4	The author conclude the story with this paragraph because the author wants to remind the reader and summarize the story. The way she wants to summarize is how the story started with Saeng failing the test to how the story endend with saeng planting the hibiscus in the winter. The author wants to remind the reader about the whole story.	1	1		1																					
2582	4	He concludes this story like that so you dont feel as if she was defeated. She is now more aware or believes she can complete the task. Also she has more selfconcious in herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home.	1	1		1																					
2589	4	There is why the author ended the story with this paragraph. It mean that when she comes back after winter she will repeat her tasks all over. For example she will dig, sen flowers, their customers. Then when winter comes again she will do it all over. So has steally the other is using different words to say when winter ends she will repeat her actions. That is why the author ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2592	4	I think that the author ends this story with that paragraph to some up what the story was all about and to also say that Saeng would try the test again. In the story it says �she realised that many of the thing that she had thought of as strange before had become, though the quiet repetition of season opon reason, almost familiar to her now and this last paragraph help bring all this together.	1	2		2																					
2594	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself,� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She buys the flower because she failed the drivers test. She has seen the familiar plant on her way home as she went to a florist shop to try to buy one. The flower makes her happy and reminds her of home. The author ends the story the way he does because it leaves hope, so that the story doesn't end sad. She still has hope of passing the drivers test."	1	2		2																					
2595	4	She failed the test at the same day that she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her. The plant represents her home, where she used to live and the geese could represent how they are moving on in life, over coming the obstacles of cold weather, and snow to move on to something better most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her. So she wanted to take it again, around the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels thot since she failed, she should start over.	2	2		2																					
2596	4	The author added the story in with this paragraph for a lot reasons and to make the story longer, and two to show that even if you screw up the first time you can still try again.	1	1		1																					
2597	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting.	0	0		0																					
2598	4	Saeng  ment  that she will take that test  next  spring and pass it with the hope of her winter flower  and  the  sight of her flock of geese  she  has high hopes that she will pass her test . when  she sees buds  on her hibiscus then she will take the test again. Saeng was very upset when she failed it the @CAPS1 time and she was hoping  she  passed  next  spring.	1	1		1																					
2599	4	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has new. found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her."	2	2		2																					
2601	4	�In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibisus is budding, then I will take that test again� Saeng thinks to herself. Saeng finds herself in a new place were she has no friends. She finds comfort in a plant shop one day when she comes apon a Hibiscus flower. The flower calms her spierit and helps her beguin to adjust to the changes in her life at this time.	2	1		2																					
2605	4	In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose the to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, �when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. Saeng�s situation is similar to the flower�s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home   	3	3		3																					
2606	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph (when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again) because it explains what she is going to do when winter is over. Also to keep the readers guessing on what�s going to happen, to Saeng and her mother. Another reason is to have a new story when winter is over.	1	1		1																					
2623	4	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agian."", to show that the hibiscus plant has given Saeng hope. It has helped he get threw some rough and difficult times. In the story Saeng has just failed her @CAPS1 test and had to walk home. She was very upset. On her way home Saeng saw a familiar flower. She had walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen. The employee pointed her towards the flower. The hibiscus brought back many memories at her hometown in vietnam. Saeng planted her flowers in the vegtable garden. That flower had given her hope. She is ready to try the @CAPS1 test again."	2	2		2																					
2632	4	The author concludes  the story  with  that paragraph  for many reasons. One reason is that the author is trying to say that she is going to overcome  the obstacle  (the test)  no matter what. In the text is say �it can make through  the  cold months. � @CAPS1 consumer her which supports the last paragraph also, she is in a new country and is starting a new beginning. In the text it says �Not like the same kind we had before.�This implies that it different in this country and she will soon adjust. Finally it says, �this hibiscus is budding� which means she will bloom.	2	2		2																					
2633	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.	1	1		1																					
2634	4	The author ends the story likes this so readers can understant the theme. Which is, you can always start over, after a mistake is made. For example saeng failed herb driving test and then it took a toll on her she will try again in the spring. I guess she figures that once she once she has renewed  herself she'll do better.	1	1		1																					
2645	4	I think the author concludes like this because its almost like a new beginning. The ending of the story makes you think that Saeng is going to get on with her life. It makes me think that @CAPS1 plans to start her life over in comparison with the hibiscus. Once the plant �starts over� (rebuds) she will start over once again. It also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in @LOCATION1. She will not let her life be distraught by her move Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to start her life over again. The ending is a �cliff hanger� to show that her story has not yet completely ended. It shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life. It also shows she doesn�t let her failures control her. She is a strong young woman and is determined to overcome this. 	2	2		2																					
2656	4	I think the author concludes the story like that because its showing the time that will be passing. When it shows time passing, she�s grew up more and maybe she�ll be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is. Also because the hibiscus will be budding, that will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed because it all make her feel more like secure home feeling. �hibiscus is budding� this way the flower will be starting new and so will she.	2	1		2																					
2663	4	The author is saying that she will be ready soon enuff when the flowers begin to grow and the geese begin to come home, she will be ready	1	1		1																					
2668	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she wants that same envioronment and everything she wanted before when she took the test	0	0		0																					
2669	4	The author�s choice of words in the conclusion of the story, I believe sent of let the reade knew that the story continues. But, I think that the test is that to remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
2674	4	The reader thinks the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl is saying she will try again, and take that test. In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� Saeng, the girl tock a test and failed it. And she got this flower that brong back memories from the past and decied She tock take this test now that thing are going to get better again. Also when the girl saw those geese flying over her, she knew they will be coming back, coming back after winter in the spring, and when they do her flower will blossom, the one that brings back good memories from the past and she will retake that test and past. Those are some examples of why I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2679	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to conclude that she will wait a little bit of time, until plants can be be planty so if she fails again, she will have something to hold on to. For example, when Saeng �failed the @NUM1) she try to overcome the feeling of failing, by buying something that reminds her of her country and bring back the memories to past thro this time. Another example is when Saeng �felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral (@NUM2),she forgot about everything that was happening in her life, from moving to @LOCATION1 to failing her test this feeling concentratted her on feeling like home again. In conclusion, the author conclusion, creates the belief that that the was Saeng gets over her problems is by remembering memories like the plant, that reminded her of her home country.	2	2		2																					
2684	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she�ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she�ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn�t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  	1	1		1																					
2685	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new life style. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change.	2	2		2																					
2687	4	The author concludes the story with paragraph because it shows Saeng�s sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she dissappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her mom�s gardening, she says, �Here, let me help, mother,� because her mom�s frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, �Saeng didn�t dare look her mother in the eye,� which shows Saeng�s concern for her mother�s reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, �It�s a beautiful plant, I�m glad you got it,� which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saeng�s sympathy to better   herself is shown in the story�s conclusion.	1	1		1																					
2690	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with a sentence about retaking the drivers test in the spring, to express the themes of adopting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower �Madagascar penwinhle� she thinks �how strange to see it in a pot� because �Back home it just grows wild,� The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says �and the geese return,� because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says �I will take that test again.� This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver�s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that �the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she �Dug out a hole� and knows it�s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng�s character.  	3	3		3																					
2698	4	He  wrote this  because  he is talking  about weather changes	0	0		0																					
2702	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph to give you a sense of hope and determination for the future that dwells within saeng at that time .Throught  the story is seemed as though saeng was giving into despair at the remembrance of her home land ,she wasnt doing so well in her new country and and she had realized it the  most when she had �failed her driving test �.but when she  walked past the flower shop and saw all the plants that used to bloom so freely and beautifly  in her home  land comfind  in those ting pots and fighting to survive it reminded her of  herself here in @LOCATION1. As she began to plant her hibiscus she again compared herself to it and that is why when her plant blooms on the spring so well she will pass that test   	2	3		3																					
2703	4	The author conclude this saying it to the story because he thought it would go because at valkay about how the hibisuse a yet budding in the winter & and how all at the geese will return to the home and stay there because they hate the winter.  	1	1		1																					
2707	4	"THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY INTENDED TO SHOW THE HOPEFUL ENLIGHTENMENT OF SAENG'S COMPLEX DILEMMA. IN THE PHRASE, ""WHEN THEY COME BACK"" THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY REFERS TO THE HIBISCUS FLOWERS THAT REPRESENT THE FOND MEMORIES OF HER HOMELAND. THE AUTHOR ILLUSTRATES SAENG'S STRUGGLE ADAPTING TO HER NEW LIFE THROUGH A �TEST� OF PLANTING THE BUDS JUST AS SHE HAD DONE BACK HOME WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. THIS TEST REPRESENTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ADAPTATION TO HER NEW LIFE. FOR THAT REASON, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED HER STORY WITH THE PARAGRAPH INDICATING SAENG WILL INDEED TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN."	1	2		2																					
2711	4	The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience.	1	1		1																					
2712	4	Well I think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her her attitude better known now she is changing so she is going to put her mind to whatever she has to do and she is going to take the test again with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away.	1	1		1																					
2714	4	"The author is concluding the story with that parapraph stating when spring and @DATE2 comes again then she will take the test again. Meaning she will plant the flowers and get them to grow again. Hoping she don�t fail at doing so. For example, ""Mrs. Lambert, liked it. this sharp bitter melon that left a golden after taste on the tongue.�"	1	0		1																					
2720	4	"The young girl Saeng from the story ""Winter Hibiscus� by minfong Ho, has moved from her home land of Vietnam to the United States. The young girl was hoping to get her drivers license but failed, The hibiscus she sees comforts her reminding her of Vietnam. When she purchases it her mother is concern of the price but sees how home sick her daughter is and becomes understanding. After planting the Hibiscus She watches the geese and understands that every year they change their habitat. The geese inspire Saeng along with the Hibiscus and promises herself that"" in the spring when the snow melts away the geese return and thes Hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."	2	2		2																					
2722	4	The author: minfong Ho, finishes the story like this to show the overcoming of obstacles. The story shows the many difficulties saeng faces when leaving her old home and comming to her new one. In the day described. She failes a drivers test, doesn�t eat lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old home. Also, this paragraph shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes her. The plant is not in its native home, faces many difficulties; the cold its small pot, and even its general surrounding. In every way, the plant is in the same circumstances as main character and the last paragraph is used to link them.   	3	2		3																					
2727	4	She concluded the paragraph with that paragraph to show that she is serious about her gardening and that she won�t garden until geese come back.	1	1		1																					
2728	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did, because Saeng is a nature freak. So she really likes nature and she would never ever hurt nature in her life and I guess that they wanted to end off with a nice paragraph. So she needs to take that test again.	0	0		0																					
2729	4	The author concludes this story because it shows her determination. It says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home. It also says that as the buds grow so will she. But her more mentally then physically. And her taking the test again is meaning that she has faith in herself that she will mature and grow up to be a person who misses their home land but accepts the new home that they live in. That is why the author ended this way.	2	2		2																					
2730	4	She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quiter and she going to try harder. 	1	1		1																					
2738	4	I belive the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed that it doesn�t mean her lifes over. She will requperate and to the same thing next year.	1	1		1																					
2743	4	He ends the story this way to show that she wants to and is willing to overcome leaving her homeland. In the story she goes to a green house. She is in the green house to test herself. She finds a plant from her homeland and and it reminds her of her grandmother. She finds other plants and they remind her of her homeland and she cries. I think she had a real connection with her grandmother. When they left their home country she probably cried for days its like she lost a part of her sole.	1	1		1																					
2746	4	The Author includes that part in his story because it�s talking about na ture and a the beuttifl thing's in natural. Ther�s the @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, tall green grass the white @CAPS3 fence and in the story there are those sanne type's of things that been in nature.	0	0		0																					
2751	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because 1. Saeng failed the test. @NUM1. It takes time for a hibiscus to bud. @NUM2. It sound like a good end i not and plus she would not want to take the test in the snow.	1	1		1																					
2752	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know that how Saeng @CAPS1 about the hibiscus. I thinks the author concludes this because he his telling the reader that the hibiscus gives saeng goodluck and with this good luck She will past the test. In the story it tells us how much saeng adores the plant For example when she got to the hibiscus She reached out and toched a petal gently. It Felt smooth and cool. Thats why the author use thal paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng @CAPS1 and how it make her  feel confident.	1	1		1																					
2753	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave readers guessing and wondering what will be next. You can tell by the tone of the last paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author seems to leave at tone of suspense.	1	1		1																					
2757	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers. The reason why the author chose to write the last paragraph like that is because it finishes the story right. That ending when the goes man away and the flowers start to grow she will try to fit in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2763	4	She said that she was going to take the test agen because to show her mom that she can do it and Past it this time. instad of worring over her old home.	1	1		1																					
2768	4	"I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" proves that shes moving on with life and so will all the creature in the world. Also even knew she moved to a new country doesn�t mean she cant still enjoy the things from her homeland, �but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.� thats why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on.  "	2	2		2																					
2769	4	The author concludes the story w/this paragraph because she really isnt worried about when they take the test again, she�s only concerned w/the plants she picked out. Also, she knows that it will be a really long time before she takes the test again so that gives her more time to study and get more prepared and focused. The author also ends this article w/this paragraph because she wants to let the readers know that since she failed the @NUM1 time she will be back again to take it over and nothing will stop the author from failing.	1	1		1																					
2787	4	The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to set the final mood. The author wanted to show that Saeng will not give up and she will continue to adapt to her new surroundings. It made the end of the story feel warm and it also inspired. The end of the story encourages the reader to not give up as well. The last paragraph sets an example of how the reader can vow to improve as well. The author knew that the last paragraph would stand as an inspiration and mabe help a reader going through something similar to the story.	1	1		1																					
2807	4	The author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. For example, She writes �she vowed silently to herself.� When you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something. Everything else that she says after that she really means it. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal.	1	1		1																					
2808	4	The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home. She won�t spend so much time dreaming about her past. �And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� I believe that thats what she needed to get on with her life.	1	1		1																					
2809	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to let us know when she�l take it again. When the season change is when she will take it again. Saeng is probably embrassed that why she wants to wait so long. Saeng took a long walk home and stoped at the flower shop. She tried getting her mind off failing the test. Saeng brought a nice flower/plant for @MONEY1. Her mother was upset at first, then realize her daughter wasn�t happy and changed her mood.	1	1		1																					
2812	4	Saeng  would  silently in spring she will take the that again in the good ending to this story it was as goods ended  because the story had listed   come  of  malance  ready and spring it and of the plant beautiful  time the spring the all as plant ending because spring in a near trying and for the take the test again of that time , to think it�s a goods ending because the ruler strong are  about   machines saeng and spring it  and  makes  is near paragraph . That is why its is a good ending plant to the stays.   	1	1		1																					
2814	4	"I believe the author concluded the story with �When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� because it shows the entire theme of the story. The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrats this when she says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example �The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair."" The hibiscus was something from home that gave her good memorys. The hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better. "	2	2		2																					
2815	4	The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time that Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, were the winter Hibiscus are popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this maner because it remins Saeng about Vietnam, and how she feels better during that time of year. When she says �And beside it was yet another old friend.� She feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable. This is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did.	1	2		2																					
2817	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of her sadness  for what she did. The test she was telling about was how she was supposed to use the twenty dollars they had and buying one. Big @CAPS1  that she spent most of money besides after to buy a plant which reminded her at home and this last paragraph is saying that when she has the chance to do the �test� again, that she will do what she is supposed to do 	1	1		1																					
2819	4	"The last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus reminded her that her ""home"" was her old life, but misses @CAPS1 in her new life. She gains determination through the reminder of this. She soon realizes that she is home, for things have come familiar to her, such as the V formation of the geese. She loved her old home, but she realized it was time to move on. The last paragraph does not only mean retaking a driving test, it symbolizes the determination to embrace her new home and life.  "	2	3		3																					
2823	4	"He ended the paragraph like that because he @MONTH1 want you to read on, or it could be that he is showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when. the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ""The quote is showing the flower can fight through the winter and come back. Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to retake the test. Which shows that they both have modivation and the integrity to come back."	1	2		2																					
2824	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, �When they com back, Saeng vowed silently to hersef, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take that test again�. I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her com fort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", This implies a new beginning so the hibiscus is representing Saeng. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2826	4	I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to get used to the new country and surroundings. In the story, the author is showing home sickness. The author see a plant that is know where she come from and buy for over @NUM1 her mother couldn�t believe it. She didn�t want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again. The last sentence is showing that author is trying to adapt.	1	1		1																					
2831	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story. I said this idea because in the story he talks about orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vires surrounded her. It talks about how these flowers surrounded her to test her. Of her @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
2833	4	Saeng thinks that she has failed because she misses her grandmother. The hiscubus plant that she buys reminds her of grandmother�s scent. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant. She needed it to feel a little bit more at home. Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in �a blink.� Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her. Saeng needs to think of the good and smile when she is reminded of her past. Saeng wants to pass the test. next time the hibiscus are budding she must not cry.	1	1		1																					
2847	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, a teenager, Saeng, moves from Vietnam to the United states. She later takes a drivers test, but doesn't not succeed in passing, but does succeed in finding comfort from her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph states ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many raesons. These being that Saeng was very upset about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland and the changes she's had to adapt to during this move. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng a hope to continue her jouney even when things get very hard. The winter is this plants time of trouble and sadness, as Saeng's time of trouble and sadness is failing this test and not being at her real home. The end of winter gives both the plant and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope to start over, Saeng will find it easy to get through hardships if she continues to find comfort from her past."	3	3		3																					
2850	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng  relatestnct  she needs more time. If she takes a break and does what she needs to then she @MONTH1 be able to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2867	4	The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to adjust to her new home and that she will not give up. You can tell that she still misses her homeland by her reaction to seeing the hibiscus plant, but also that she is growing accustomed to her new home because of how she recognizes the geese and will make the decision if when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns.	2	1		2																					
2874	4	I think the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph for these reasons. The first reason is to show that the girl won't give up. She was crying in the store and just very depressed. But, she knows that she has to keep going. It shows a sense of determination. Another reason why I think the author made this the last paragraph is this. It showed her getting used to her environment. I think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together. That way she gets hope from both. For example, in the article it says �many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become�.. almost familiar to her now. This shows that she is realizing that she is used to the arrangement right now. So she then gets hope from it. Also, I, think the author did that so that it would add a positive effect on the story. That is why I think the author wrote that as the last paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2876	4	The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.� Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom.	2	2		2																					
2877	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. Durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it it�s winter and the hibiscus hasen�t bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And thats why I think the author ended with that paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2878	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it�s saying that she can�t work in the garden in winter, but �when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,� are all signs of spring. In the spring, she will take the test again; which implys that she will work in the garden.	0	0		0																					
2880	4	because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place	1	1		1																					
2881	4	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph becauses it symbolizes Saeng�s decision to try again. Things in nature are repeatative, seasons change but eventually they appear again, geese migrate but they too return and the author used this as a comparsion to Saeng�s decision to try for her license again. Just like Saeng the winter hibiscus was out of. As normal environment but was learning to adapt and that inspired Saeng to keep an trying even if she failed because the hibiscus was trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place.	2	2		2																					
2883	4	She see if her plant will survive then the winter just like the ones back at home.. And she things will be the. Same.	1	1		1																					
2897	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.	1	1		1																					
2903	4	I think the author concludes this paragraph in this story to describe how grown up Saeng is now since it doesn�t look like she leaves with her mom anymore. To the author probably wants to emphasize the reader @CAPS1 of Saeng, now on for she probably leave since she doesn't leave with her mom anymore. In what happen was just her past and will be memorable to Saeng.	0	0		0																					
2905	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isn't going to give up.	1	1		1																					
2906	4	With the hibiscus around Saeng she will have more courage and also have had more time to adapt in their new home. For Saeng the hibiscus is like motivation and it also reminds her. Of her old homeland. The reason I think the author choose to end the story with the paticular comment is to show that Saeng had in the end found courage and is ready to accept her tasks in this foreign land.  	0	0		0																					
2909	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, was a great way to end it becase I think that she sees how much the hibiscus can take then she can take just about anything mainly the test. Also when her mother said �You what?� �Her mother stared at her incredulously�. Sh might have also understood that if her mum could get over being mad then she would over come being upset about the test.	2	2		2																					
2910	4	The writes this this conclusion to the end of the story because he wants people to know that the season's are changing and the flowers are going to be dying. He also wants you you to know that when the season changes back the flower will try and fit again with the other flowers. that�s what the author means when he talks about taking the test again.	0	0		0																					
2912	4	the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first their is always a second time just like the @CAPS1 I dies in the winter and it come back alive in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2914	4	I think the author ends the story like this becuose of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a simple of her home but also as a symble of good luck. In the text she holds the plant in a very high value, having payed @NUM1 coins for it, So I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing.	1	1		1																					
2915	4	The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to @LOCATION1, the geese show her that she is, even now adapting to her new homeland when she geese seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was pretty but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she came to @LOCATION1, is adopted to the mre resilient and withstand the snow which symbolizes her problems adapting to @LOCATION1. For saeng, the hibiscus budding again represents her becoming stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to go take the test again when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to connect the Hibiscus budding with Saeng overcoming her obstacles. 	3	3		3																					
2916	4	The author chose to conclude the story like that because she’s saying that it isn’t over and she’s going to take the test again. In the story Saeng says “I- I failed the test” so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.	1	1		1																					
2917	4	I think what the author is trying to say is that she will take her driving test again in the spring when the flowers are out because it will make her feel more relaxed. The flowers put the author in a relaxed state of mind where she can focus.	1	1		1																					
2918	4	Because she saying when the @CAPS1 grow back she will be @CAPS2 to take the test again.	3	3		3																					
2920	4	"In the story �the Winter Hibiscus"", I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the memories  of  her old country would always be with her but she soon will adapt to her new one. Also from time to time she still will visit her old country. For example �when the show melts and the geese return"", The last sentences, then I will take the test again�, This sentence means that once she is adapted to this country on goes back to her old one she still will enjoy their either way."	1	1		1																					
2933	4	The authors choice of the last paragraph in the short story, �Winter Hibiscus shows the hope for the future that seang feels. The winter and cold represent how she feels out of place and upset at not receiving her driver�s license. In the spring she will have a piece of her homeland blooming and she will be warm again. She will feel ready to take her test again �when they came back. This shows adapting to and accepting her new life away from her home and her memories. The last paragraph proves that she was strong enough to move past her hardships and move on	2	2		2																					
2934	4	The speaker @MONTH1 conclude the story with that paragraph because the geese returning and the hibiscus budding @MONTH1 help her with her confidence. She wants to feel like she can do this test.	1	1		1																					
2935	4	"The author conclude the story with the paragraph ""when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese returned this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She realize she has another chance to pass the test, when the spring blossoms again she begin to garden when the spring returns."	1	1		1																					
2938	4	I�ll think the author tried two say wean it coming two snow melt like @MONTH1 they she will be come back. Author will because in the spring sometime to written a new book.	0	0		0																					
2941	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home.  For example, she said �I failed,� talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live. For example, she said �its not like the one at home.� That�s why the author concludes this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2945	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the true meaning of the hibiscus. The hibiscus is symbolic to Saeng in several ways, but the most important is that it represents change and growth and the ability to overcome obstacles. Upon seeing it, she is overcome with childhood memories and sentimentality. However, she must adjust to her new home if she wants to grow as a person. She will survive here, just as the hibiscus will survive through the winter. Also, Saeng vows that �in the spring� when �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is determined to succeed, and the hibiscus itself represents triumph over obstacles.  It stands for survival and endurance through life�s disappointments and challenges, from failing a driver�s test to starting a new life in a strange and foreign country. The author�s choice to end the story with this paragraph exhibits Saeng�s ultimate understanding of her strength through the symbol of the hibiscus.	3	3		3																					
2946	4	I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn�t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year. Ane example of this is an exact quote �in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again�. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that.	1	1		1																					
2957	4	Because her school work was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a green garden. And it is obvious she failed the test so when spring starts to show she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom and she can do more study to pass the test and not have to take it again. I get the feeling though she is also looking forward to the spring time coming back now an day so she can enjoy the flowers and the presents of growing and studying.	1	1		1																					
2968	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph before they were talking about the �winter hibiscus� and the geese. So the author just simply writes another concluding paragraph that just wraps the story up, and the reader walkes away with a feel good feeling.	1	1		1																					
2974	4	I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that, is that it awhave ending. also so you know that the story is that they could make more.	1	1		1																					
2978	4	"The author concludes the story with this parapraph because it ties it all together. I think that the author uses. it also to say that in the spring she will pass the test. I really like the part when she says ""�in the spring, when the snows melt�."" I like that because it explains what she wants and how she puts her mind to it."	1	1		1																					
2979	4	The author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over. She uses geese as a symbol for spring, when she would start preparing for this �test� once again. The hibiscus budding in this paragraph shows hope, because it is once again, a start of a cycle as well as an object of reminiscence in the story. In conclusion, this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and devices in order to convey hope, good memories, and fresh start.	2	2		2																					
2981	4	THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE REASON BEING THAT THE AUTHOR WANTED TO REALLY SHOW THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER. ANOTHER REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME. FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THAT PARAGRAPH IT SAYS �THEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.�, ITS RELATING THAT SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER. WHICH THEN RELATES IT TO THE THEME OF ADJUSTING AND KEEP TRYING TILL YOU ADJUST. THAT LAST PARAGRAPH WAS QUITE VITAL TO THE THEME AND MEANING OF THE STORY.	2	1		2																					
2989	4	The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginnig of the story the girl failed the test. And so when she told her mother she saw that she was upset with it. So after they planted the plant she decided to take the test over knowing that her mother would think the best of it. Also its in there because the story started out with her telling her mother that she failed the test.  And if you kept it out people who read it would be like, ok, so her mother just let her fail the test and didn�t do anything about it. Plus when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they are going to be wanting to know if she took it again, and why she took it again if she did.	1	1		1																					
2991	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up until she successfully passes the task he mother gives her.Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant it is much to expensive. �But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn�t cost that much!� Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has failed her mother. Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. �Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the �winter hibiscus� into it.� This shows that even though she had failed she wasn�t going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home. It was very special to her.	1	1		1																					
3000	4	The author concludes the story with �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She does this to show now Saeng is adapting and making decisions in her new country just like she did in her homeland. In Vietnam Saeng used to brush her grandmothers hair and help put it into a bun and put a hibiscus in it. That was one of her traditions with it. Also when she used to get water from the well a hibiscus would sometimes come up with the bucket. Both these thus the hibiscus was seen as a comfort object, now as she is in the states, she is trying to put it to good use, while also taking into account what repeats in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and plants start to grow in the spring. By her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom. The plant being potted in her garden and Saeng moving her both signify change, but a rembrance of old traditions, and a space for new.     	3	3		3																					
3008	4	In the conclusion of the �Winter Hibiscus� Saeng notes how she will retake  her driving test in the spring when the snow melt sand the geese return.The spring is when these events occur along with the annual budding  of the  winter  hibiscus. Her family had moved from Vietnam to @LOCATION2, and she had bought a winter hibiscus  plant  to remind  her of  her  childhood. When it blooms, she  will retake her driving test because the body will bring her the hope of a new beginning in her life, and as a citizen in @LOCATION2.	2	2		2																					
3023	4	Clearly From rending the story Winter @CAPS1, the author @CAPS2 this phrase �when they come Back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test Again� in the story because the passage relates to the title of the story Winter @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
3025	4	I think the author ends the story with that paragraph because it is linting the plant that stands for many positive things to the character that failed the test that the really wanted to pass. Both the character and the plant show perservirance and I think the author is trying to send a message to the reader to never give up on something you want to accomplish. The plant gives an emblem of perseverance because it survives through the harsh winter. The main character isn�t giving up on the test she wants to pass. The author is giving a message not to give up.	2	2		2																					
3033	4	I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It basically sumarizises the story and sums it up into few words that would want you to wonder what happened next, and if there is a sequel. This is a very good story that I personally can relate to in many ways.	1	1		1																					
3036	4	Why did the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Is so he can right another story budding on vowed silently and he will right the. Story in the spring when they come back	0	0		0																					
3041	4	What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that where it is a seasson for those plants she will take the test again. The test to begin to like like the plot. Like features and characters about. Also the history about these plants. 	0	0		0																					
3042	4	She is demanding to not take the test again if the winter hibiscus don't come back she was upset that she had failed the test. She spent most of her day looking at the hibiscus but she was still upset that they were�nt the real ones back at home. Her mother said they are strong enough to make it through the winter. when they come back  Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again	1	1		1																					
3046	4	"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home, and the old, together in harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which relates to the determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently through the winter. A lot of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages hidden within that final sentence It implies that, though the past @MONTH1 be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can be conquered."	1	2		2																					
3047	4	The authar concludes the story with the paragraph they because it shows saeng determination and her overcoming her obstacles of being new in a country. With all of the doubts saeng had right after her test it is very big of her to come to this conclusion of retaking the test, �Here, let me help you mother,she offered� (HO). With her mom comforting her and telling her it is @CAPS1, gives saeng the boost she needs to help her mother and think to herself that she can�t let just one thing hold her back in life. the support saeng has she will definetly pass the test the next time.	2	1		2																					
3051	4	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng was a very determined person. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng was a strong character because throughout the story she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time. But when she failed, the author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up hope and that she was going to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3053	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because he is making a point about immigration. The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to @CAPS1 they were told to forget where they were from . The word test in the story means getting used to @LOCATION1 and forgetting her homeland. Saeng  says thoes words because she failed the test and bought something that reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion the Author is describing how immigrants were treated and told to forget who they were because their in @LOCATION1 now."	0	1		1																					
3054	4	In the story �Winter @CAPS1� the author was trying to saying that Saeng was from somewhere then where he is now. In the text It say�s �It was like walking into another world so he is there thinking like no boby know him except for him and him only.	0	0		0																					
3055	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because its show signs of hope and that knowing that spring will come again. For the family and that everything will be ok. For them also. The girl will makes friends also when spring comes.	1	1		1																					
3058	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is thinking what it will be like when all of this happens. Saeng said; �when they come back, she vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.	0	0		0																					
3064	4	The author, Minfong  Ho, concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The  �budding hibiscus� symbolizes comfort for her. When moving to @LOCATION1 she couldn�t take all her friends a possessions with her, but she could bring memories. The flower reminds her of home, which is comforting after she failed her drivers test. In addition, the �geese returning� symbolizes a new beginning. After being away for so long, the geese returning ushers  in springs a time to start all over after a dreasy  winter. Finally �;,.then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 that one should never give up. Even though ve was hard for her to adapt to a new  country, she made friends a tried @CAPS2 foods, like a Big @CAPS3. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the story with the paragraph to show comfort, new beginnings  a never give up.	3	3		3																					
3069	4	I think the author concludes the story with that statement simply because, mabe he is trying to send out some sort of message to people and get their attention The author also could of concluded the story off with that statement because mabe he Just felt like he need to do that, mabe he didn't have a particular reason for doing it.	0	0		0																					
3072	4	"The author concluded the last paragraph in the story ""winter Hibiscus"" to say that the narrator ""Saeng"" isn�t given up on her driving test"	1	1		1																					
3076	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to explain to us that this plant is going to bring good luck. The snow will melt, the geese will return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. Its starting over fresh, a new beggining. Since she had failed her driving test she will start over in the spring. In conclusion this is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3077	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to say in the spring when the plant starts over Saeng will start over to. The story shows that this is the meaning because Saeng was having a really hard winter and was having a hard time adjusting to all of the new things, but in the spring she can start over just like the hibiscus will.	1	1		1																					
3081	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show us that her days with nature is not yet over, for when it comes back around, she will continue to do what she been was doing, whicvh was growing her plants, taking care of them, tuning them out to being a goodnight dinner, and to continue that until she�s no longer to do anymore.	0	0		0																					
3083	4	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a new country. In this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so. Saeng took a test and failed and in the winter, flowers fail but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms Saeng will ""bloom"" and try the test again. Moving can be a hardship especially when it is to place very unfimiliar. People find ways to make themselves promises & to remind them of their old home."	2	2		2																					
3087	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authorconcludes the story with, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt. and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again'' because the hibiscus represents hope and adapting to circumstances. Saeng is trying to adapt to the new changes in herlife but nothing is working out for her.""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst in to tears again.""@CAPS2, the Hibiscus makes her life easier because it reminds her of her homeland, @CAPS3 it gives her hope, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing, '''the root-bound represents Saeng inher new country. Unwilling to try anything, and getting scared but assoon as Saeng and her mother plant the hibiscus, Saeng realizes that by planting it, she is going to try to love her new life in @LOCATION1 and in spring when the hibiscus and Saeng is ready to blossom, she will start trying to accept life."	3	3		3																					
3090	4	I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because in the story, the author says �through the quiet repitition of season upon season� which means that seasons will come a seasons will go but she�ll always be there, ready to �take the test�	1	1		1																					
3094	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 It mean so many things about her in just one little sentence. For example ""take that test again"" she willing to do it all over again @CAPS1 she love it and want to do it. Also when she said ""in spring; when the snows melts and the gesse return and this hibicous is' budding"" from that when you come back and don't forget about all the things she just list. That why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. "	1	1		1																					
3095	4	This story about believed in yourself, and never giving up it was a story about perseverance. Saeng really believed she could pass her driver's test, and although she was disappointed with result, she found a way to cope with her loss. The hibiscus that flower means a lot to her because she can connect it to her homeland and, and it is a thing of beauty. something she needed at such an ugly time for her. It's always hard o adapt to a new country in a short period of time. I know what it's like when one small thing goes wrong. You can snap and it will feel a lot worse than it actually is. You feel helpless and alone just like the hibiscus growing next to the highway in the photo. Saeng vowed to take her driver�s test again when her hibiscus would bloom in the spring I think the hibiscus really symbolizes Saeng as a person.	2	3		3																					
3102	4	"At the end of the short story, �winter Hibiscus�, the writer Minfong Ho includes somewhat inspirational concluding sentence �when they come back  in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.� I think this sentence was added in order to create a sense of hope for the future, which contrasts so greatly with the depressing nature of the story, creating a happy ending. Throughout the essay, Saeng is depressed she had to leave her homeland so hurriedly losing her childhood and beloved grandmother, �A blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone.� as Saeng narrates in deeper detail. Also contributing to the feelings of sorrow in the story is how much saeng cries remembering her tragic past. Im both the greenhouse, recalling the events of her grandmother such as when she says, �Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it."" and in the garden, when she talks to her mother and plants the flower. After all this sorrow, by putting in a hopeful ending, the writer has successfully allowed a sense of hope for the future.    "	3	3		3																					
3111	4	She said that because she was more intrested in flowers tha a test.	0	0		0																					
3112	4	I believe that the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows the ending of one thing and the beginning of another.After she is upset and thinks about home she realizes that something new is happening and she needs to accept it.So therefore  in the spring she is going to start new like the flower blossom.	1	1		1																					
3113	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants to get the point out that the character dosnt want to rush into things she wants to  do right and not take the quick way out.  	0	0		0																					
3115	4	The author ends this story with this paragraph because she is explaining her thoughts and why she is taking that test. She is explaining that next year she will find out if it feels like home to her.	0	0		0																					
3117	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because this paragraph represent saeng�s determination and the situation she has now. She just come to the new country and she haven�t adjusted herself to this new country yet. She was disappointed like �mashaft of the war afternoon starlight.� �war� showed saeng was ery upset. After she met the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland she missed it. She felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home. Last she burst into tears again. She missed her homelad very much �snows"" symbolized the difficult situation she had now. But she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. �spring� symbolized the hope to the new life saeng thought things would get better in the spring. She would succeed in the spring. She had the determination to succeed, so the author uses that paragraph at conclusion. It symbolizes hope."	3	2		3																					
3123	4	The author of winter Hibiscus , Minfong Ho ended the story in this way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying. �Its flowers aren�t as pretty but it�s strong enough to make it through the winter. That�s what matters. �Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their lives again in @LOCATION1, that @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as pretty, but it will survive, which is what matters. Her words soothe her daughters worries about starting ore. Also, the budding hibiscus could be considered asymbol of rebirth, since it is dying and growing with the seasons.The family is dying in out a @CAPS1 family & being @CAPS2 was an @CAPS3 family. However even though they �died� as a @CAPS1 family, that does not meqan that they have lost their heritage which is why the author end talking about a flower that is both @CAPS1 & @CAPS3 just like Saeng.	3	3		3																					
3124	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will perservere through the winter and try to adapt to her new lifestyle. Moving to a new country / culture is extremely tough, and Saeng is bad, but she doesn�t  give up on creating a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,� is one of determination and hope. The entire story Saeng was struggling with adapting to her non of  and memory of her homeland give has a sense of security. The sentence wraps up her emotion and shows how strong she is @CAPS1  could easily give up on their driving test, but she won�t. It is a happy ending for somewhat of a sad story. Furthering the sentence shows Saeng�s dwoton  the her plant. This hibiscus will survive and so will Saeng when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so will Saeng. She will try as hard she can to fit in and enjoy her new life. That plant will help her through it by reminding her of vietnam us will as giving her a companion throughout the winter. The  author would not have chosen a better  conclusion for this story. The conclusion orggos  to a new hope to perservere  and sucede. As a result, the reader is test with a sense of pleasure and a good feeling torwards the story. This conclusion show how Saeng is adapting to changes info and hope to enjoy her  new life in @LOCATION1.	3	3		3																					
3129	4	The author ends the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� to show a comparison. Since the plant reminds her of home, when it buds she will be more confident to take the test. When she was looking at the petals of the flower it said, �Gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least she could hold on to.� This shows that she really missed her home, and she had nothing to give her confidence. The flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her drivers test. Saeng felt out of place in her new environment. The flower hibiscus, gave her motivation. It gave her a chance to connect with a part from her old home, in her new home. Saeng thinks, �And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar too�. This shows that this flower was a sentimental importance, she needed. Therefore, the author ended with that paragraph to show a comparison and the importance of the flower to her adapting.  	3	3		3																					
3133	4	"I @CAPS1 I @CAPS1 the author concludes the story with the paragraph saying that she�s going to take the test again, to show us that this time she�s goin to pass the test and she�s not going to feel the same way she felt when she didn�t pass. it tell us in �spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" because thats when she is going to take the test. "	1	1		1																					
3142	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph she did because it shows how Saeng is adapting with the change she is going through in @LOCATION1.the winter hibiscus helped her @CAPS1 with Failing her driving test, so Saeng figures it will give her luck when she takes it again. Also the hibiscus will survive, and while she works towards her goal it will develop more. Once the flower blooms, it will symbolize strength, helping Saeng over come this obstacle. Her mother said the flower was not as pretty but will survive. She means @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as great as Vietnam, but Saeng will stay strong.	2	2		2																					
3143	4	The purpose for the ending the Author @CAPS1 is to show how the hibiscus gives Saeng A good sense of comfort, compared to how:- she was At the beginning of the story. It Was like she had very little confidence. And now she is forced to call this strange place home, And that emptied her @CAPS2 to strive until she see�s A very familiar face that brings back her memories of when She was the happiest. Having something Around that was special to her Around All the time can make @CAPS3 feel At home or like it use to be, she found her confort in the Hibiscus. So now that it rests in her garden to constantly grow through All the seasons, She will to with that reminder of her old home and how good it felt, except now with new memories.	2	3		3																					
3145	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, �Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,� This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, �Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,� she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person.	2	2		2																					
3146	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he or she feels like the audience should know what saeng is feeling. This paragraph ending shows that saeng will keep trying every spring to grow back her flowers and this shows that Saeng has a lot of potential to make her vowe top herself successful.	1	1		1																					
3149	4	In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again.	2	1		2																					
3154	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagein what rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example when the author said �then I will take that test again.� Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story. For example when the author said �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. Those were reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3162	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the story ends with that phrase to show that Saeng has goals. First, she wants to adapt to the new this new land. This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life. This also says she has precision, she will continue to try to get her license because she says, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She says that she will try again. Also, it exploits that she will get the courage to keep on trying and not give up."	2	2		2																					
3163	4	Saeng was waiting for spring then she could take the test again. I think at se was wereing about it doing spring because she whent to wacth the geese fly in a u shape and she whent to see the plant grow but the snow don�t melt yet. She started takeing to herself about it but she could whant to take at test doing spring. At if she can passed it again because she doesn�t like to take the test over and over again. When every body gets to the diffent thing after thee test is over.	1	1		1																					
3164	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driver�s test. To Saeng her failing the driver�s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng�s promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didn�t give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.     	3	2		3																					
3167	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the �test� again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng�s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she �failed the test�, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow.	3	3		3																					
3168	4	The girl is determend to win. She wen�t and took a test for a flower and she did not pass and she went back sad and emoshond she told her grandmother that these flowers are not like the ones at-at she cold not say at home because it took too much pain and her grandmother said they are not like the real wones.	1	1		1																					
3169	4	In this story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho , the author concludes the story with, �When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� In the beginning of the story that she was less confident and she failed the test.  But this one flower gave her hope and so next time she takes the test she�ll be better prepared. 	1	1		1																					
3174	4	The author concluded the story the way they did because it left hope .Saeng hod been hurt anddissappointed but in the end she had shown hope in the story Saeng failedher driving test. She was very disappointed . In The endit  showed she was not going to quit in this new country . She was going to move on and make the best of what she has.	1	1		1																					
3179	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, �and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.� I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home. 	2	3		3																					
3180	4	I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it�s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she�ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus �comes back to life��. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she�ll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. So practically she�s stating once everything �come back to life� then she�ll feel like she will pass it next time. Now she can be prepared.	2	3		3																					
3189	4	Saeng will take the test in the spring when it�s not so cold. She likes it when the hibicus is budding they smell so good. They good smell reminders her of her native contrey. Saeng likes fried melon, it leaves a golden after taste on your tongue. She would poter it over a Big mac. 	1	1		1																					
3195	4	Saeng has been the victim of a tragic  loss  in  family  and also  a move  to  a totally different  world. The paragraph  is  symbolic  of  turning over a new leaf and starting over.The �snows  melting� and �hibiscus bidding� are both symbolizing  new life.Saeng is going to have a outlook on life and accept  her situation to  make  the  best  of  it. Also, the  author say �the  winter  hibiscus  was  in the ground now� as  it does compare to saengs new found  outlook  planted on life. Like the flower, a seed of hope was planted into Saeng, and now she is ready to blossom.	2	2		2																					
3200	4	He concludes that when it is spring he will take the test again. That will give her another chance to pass it. This will give her another chance to do what is right.	1	1		1																					
3208	4	The author  concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus gave her some hope. Also , because her mother was understanding  about  her  failing the test. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph .	1	1		1																					
3214	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he is telling the reader that after the snow leaves the author will begin to plant more plants. The test is to make sure his plants don�t die during next @DATE1.	0	0		0																					
3216	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how some some people vowed silently because the don�t want to express themselves. Also maybe because they are not very mistful of people even themself. One day I was  like that I didn�t want to talk to anybody. All I want to do is sit in my room and think. Think about my life were I am going to go after i die. I just woulnd sit in my room in the dark wondering if in my room in the dark wondering if I  would come back in another body or will my soul roam the earth. But think I starting think that I am a kid, I got a wonderful like a head of me. I when I get to the one where I need to think about then I would . So  I started talking to everybody again	0	0		0																					
3223	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in th spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph is that what happens to his life that he will take the test again. But in the story it talks about. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it So I think that they take care of there garden and try to make it live in the winter. So thats what I think about the last paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	1	1		1																					
3224	4	"The author concludes the story with this because that one paragraph basically sums the whole story up. ""When the snow melts and the geese return"" basically goes back to the beginning of the story when saeng started planting. This is why the author gave the story ends conclusion."	0	0		0																					
3230	4	"When they  come back, Saeng vowed to silently herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and  this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concluded this story in such a way that it makes the reader ask questions much live in the �@CAPS1�s @ORGANIZATION1� when there was a modernist way to interprentle means of a sty by makeing the reader ask questions instead of that beig a moral to the story. For example in the �@CAPS1�s @ORGANIZATION1"" the main character @PERSON1 run away and all are could get as a slaming door. Much live in this story there is a twist in that what test is the main character talking about? Is she goig to try to move ww friends? is this live a resolution she is making to herself? also this leaves the reader wanting more of the story so that they @MONTH1 go back and even read it again."	1	1		1																					
3238	4	Minfong Ho concluded �Winter Hibiscus� with the lines �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� to show that there is always hope for better things to come. Saeng had become sad because she remembered her home in Vietnam. She longed for her natural home and familiarity. Her missed memories agonizingly hurt Saeng because she was now for away and in a different world. However, the author started to reveal hints that @ORGANIZATION1 would accept @LOCATION2 and find come childhood memories there too. �Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and �yes- familiar to Saeng now.� Already, Saeng was growing familiar with her surrounding area in @LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would keep her @CAPS1 culture, tradition, and memories alive, as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in @LOCATION2. As one kept her @CAPS1 and �@CAPS3 culture alive through memories, she would continue a successful life and pass her test. That is why Minfong Ho ended �Winter Hibiscus� with the particular paragraph.	3	2		3																					
3239	4	The author concludes the story in winter hibiscus, Kind of funny/ weird like . The concluding sentence is �when they come back saeng vowed silently to herself in the  spring, when  the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I know one thing the part of the title is in the concluding sentence, so it is basically it is concluding the whole  story, plus the characters	0	0		0																					
3240	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready. The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.	2	2		2																					
3243	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring it�s warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.	0	0		0																					
3251	4	The author concludes �Winter Hibiscus� with the paragraph because it continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life. In the story, Saeng has come to the United States from Vietnam and it is quite a change. Also changed are the plants. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, but it is different. The mother in the story says, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus. �The hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes. The final paragraph talks about snow melting, geese returning and the hibiscus budding. These are all changes the author uses to connect to the theme. This adds more understanding to the story�s message. Additionally, the tone of the last paragraph is hopeful, which gives the reader a positive feeling. The tone adds to the theme of the story.	2	3		3																					
3262	4	I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasn�t ready for before but now whenever the geese return and the hibiscus return the she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasn�t mentally prepared. So inconclusion I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return the she will take the test and maybe she wasn�t physicaly and mentally prepared for it. 	1	1		1																					
3263	4	Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. �when the snow melts and the geese return� This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things.	2	2		2																					
3264	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she�s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here. She�s said  and does lots of fun things.	0	0		0																					
3272	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is like say most of the story but in a small and shorter way.	0	0		0																					
3277	4	The author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. All throughout the story there was depresing nogistalistic tone that made the reader yearn for the past. The author wanted to put on emphisis on being strong even though you @MONTH1 not enjoy where you are at. Also the author wanted to show the strength of the main of the main character Saeng. Even though she has just failed a test in a new, strange world she still wishes to continue pushing foward. This adds more demension the the character and makes her less static and more dynamic. This is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward.	2	2		2																					
3278	4	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to get some roots in the new soil she is on. When she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time.	2	1		2																					
3280	4	�when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author has left her home and moved to another country. She is now in an unfamilar place. Everything that now surrounds her is new and mostly un-known. By ending the story with this quote, it suggest that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home. When she left her home, she did not just leave a building behind. She left her home, people she loved, and an endless list of memories. At times she @MONTH1 have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now �out of the box,� and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and �failed her test.� The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own test of adapting.  	3	2		3																					
3293	4	The author concluded the story with that ending because in the spring when everything blossoms. And she wouldnt be focused while there is snow. So when the hibiscus is budding, thats when she will be able to take her test again. I think he wrote that because it means something to her.	1	0		1																					
3296	4	Saeng is @CAPS1 that it Will be a longtime before she will worn about school work again. thats Why the author concluds the story with their paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3302	4	The author concludes the story with they paragraph that they did because it's about the same thing that they opened the story with.  To introduce the story, the author tells about Saeng failing her drivers test, and then seeing a familiar plant that she wants to buy. The middle of the story is about how she is having a hard time adapting to her new home. So to conclude the story, the author puts that Saeng will take her drivers test again, once the flowers starts budding, and the geese come out. The flower and the geese remind her of home, so this tells you that thinking of her home, and the objects that make her feel at home, comfort her, and help her overcome obstacles.	2	2		2																					
3304	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it connects the hibiscus back to the trials and triumphs of saeng . Just how saeng can�t give up .and must go back to retake the test, the winter hibiscus must make it through the hard, rough winter and come back strong . The hibiscus are a symbol of hope and saeng thinks of them as her hope. Throughout the story, the hibiscus are comforting to saeng because they remind her of home. The author includes this because many people can relate to this and find hope in things.  For saeng, knowing that each year the hibiscus will come back in those conditions, reassures her that she�ll be okay there as well.	2	2		2																					
3307	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back� and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."	1	1		1																					
3309	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wanted to show that Saeng doesn�t give up and that nature gives @CAPS1 strength. The conclusion shows that Saeng doesn�t give up by saying that she is going to take the test again, even though she failed it earlier that day. Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by saying that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return, when hibiscus buds and when the snow melts in spring nature gives her strength because it reminds her of where they used to live and her grandmother. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature gives her strength and confidence.	2	2		2																					
3317	4	I would say that the author concluded this story ently paragraph because they wanted to be very consist. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and understanding of the text. In brief words.	0	0		0																					
3319	4	The author decides to conclude the story with this paragraph to show the strength and confidence Saeng has. By saying she would try to pass the test again in the spring is showing she is confident and is looking for a new beginning to come then. Also he concludes it this way because after she failed the test she didn�t have much self-confidence. And once she spoke to her mother and knew she was understanding, Saeng knew she had to try again and perservire until she passed the test.	2	1		2																					
3322	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because he is showing that she will not give up and she will do it when she is ready to. The reason I say this is because she is doing the test when she wants to, when she feels comfortable. Those are the reasons I belive that the author ended the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3327	4	I think the author ended the story like that because she enjoys to see the geese and she loves the spring and wants to take the test and pass. Sh is studying for it in the mean time.	1	1		1																					
3334	4	They ended it because the girl is not going to give up. She is going to keep trying at this test and wont stop at it eaither. And she will be alittle brighter. She will also pass this test. And this way she wont disappoint her mother. And she will be able to get this test of of her sholders.	1	1		1																					
3338	4	In the story the author concludes that after shes done her test and there's nothing that to see she'll grow more.	0	0		0																					
3343	4	The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample �But it�s strong enough to make it through winter�, says her mother. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself �Then i will take the test again.�     	2	2		2																					
3346	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years.	1	1		1																					
3347	4	I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Now tell that wasn�t beautiful.	0	0		0																					
3348	4	Then author put the last sentence the way it did. It mean't by that next spring they want to see how they react different of the same. They know what it is like but they know how to react to the season.	0	0		0																					
3354	4	The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it.	1	1		1																					
3356	4	The last paragraph in, ��Winter Hibiscus,�� was add because the author want to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test. She feels disapointed because her mom is disapointed in her and knows she can pass it. While she stares at the Hibiscus then the geese flying in the air, she thinks that she does have a chance in passing the test. Now that she is determined to take the test, she is going to take it at the same time in the next year and she believes she is going to pass it.    	2	1		2

3364	4	Saeng is talking about her school work and the garden. She always connects the two of them in the same way. she knows that she has to study while the garden grows and she wants to water  the flowers and she is saying that when the spring comes she wont be there for the garden and she will have to take the test.	0	0		0																					
3370	4	The author most likely concludes the story with that paragraph because they are trying to show the reader that even though you fail at something, you can�t be stubborn. So Saeng failed her drivers test but in the spring when the hibiscus plant starts to bud she will go back and take the test again. By the plant budding she thinks of that as a sign that she will pass the test	1	1		1																					
3371	4	The Author concludes the story with Saeng saying a vow silently to herself to show the reader that she will grow like the hibiscus plant and take the test again, this time determined to pass it. The plant gives Saeng hope because it reminds her of the homeland that she loved so much. When the hibiscus starts budding and gaining beautiful flowers, Saeng will �bud� too and gain her license.	1	1		1																					
3375	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the willingness of Saeng to overcome the obstacles and adapt to her new life. The hibiscus discussed in the ending quote describes Saeng�s new hope and determination to succeed in the United States. For example in the text it states,""� its fine petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.� When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to the together her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents newhope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually succeed. In addition, in the text it says, �it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.� Saeng�s past memones could be reached when this hibiscus was in new and that served as immense inspiration to her. The author ended the story with Saeng�s new recollection and hope to prove that she had indeed found something helpful and stable in a new world."	3	3		3																					
3377	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn�t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story.	2	2		2																					
3385	4	The ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story. It is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader. In the end of the story Winter Hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement. The conclusion encourages you to keep trying, because it states that next year when the flower blooms Saeng will re-take the test. This shows encouragement because has the drive to try again and to pass. The author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is strong and also seems to recap the stories meaning because all along Saeng keeps getting disapointed about the flower, her mother, and homeland encourage her to move on and try again. The ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was truly trying to convey	2	1		2																					
3391	4	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding; then I will take that test again. The author concludes this story Winter Hibiscus with this paragraph because in the story it's about Saeng and she fails her drivers test, and notice a familiar plant which causes her to go to a florist shop. As Saeng learns about this familian plant it encourages her to retake that drivers test, to where as though the snow is gone and the sun is shining.	1	1		1																					
10535	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say in the spring when the snow goes away and the hibiscus start growing she will test the plant again       	0	0		0																					
10536	4	""The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng still has hope to succeed and adapt in this new country. She previously had a lot of home sickness, missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her child hood. The height of her homesickness is seen when Saeng comes back to her house and is explaining to her mother the nature of the hibiscus. �She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� Saeng is uncomfortable living in @LOCATION1 and wishes to go back to Vietnam. Butt by the end, Saeng�s attitude changes from despair to hope. Even though she has failed her driver�s test. Saeng is determined and hopeful to do at least something in this new country by saying ""...then I will take the test again.� Saeng has changed a good deal within this story and that change in attitude is seen with the exerpt on geese in the last paragraph."	3	2		3																					
3394	4	The author concludes the story like this because it shows how the main character has been effected by the events or happenings in the story. In the beginning of the story we learn that the main character has failed her driver�s test. Also in the story she had spent a large amount of money just for one plant, in which her mother is shocked about. The reader at that point would expect for her to be very sad and depressed. But because of her grandmother and her homeland she instead surprizes the reader by looking on the brightside of things and saying that when the flower blooms again she will take the test again. This shows the connection between the main character and the plant. Giving the plant a humanlike existence.	3	2		3																					
3399	4	I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese.	0	0		0																					
3400	4	There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, �Winter Hibiscus,� in the way that she did. �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here�� is what Saeng�s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states ��she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become�almost familiar to her now.� Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time.	3	3		3																					
3412	4	The author choses to end the story like this to inspire a sense of determination. Saeng got the plant to remind her of her homeland and cheer her up. Once the plant is bloomed she feels like she would as well and be ready for the test.	1	2		2																					
3418	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with a sentence stating that when Saeng�s Hibiscus� first bud appears in the spring she will be back to take drivers test. The author might have decided to conclude the story like that because what if the plant died, would she go back and take the test? The author was probably just wanting the reader to think hard about it. In conclusion, the author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� might have concluded his story to make it somewhat suspenseful.	1	1		1																					
3419	4	The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, �Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world� (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her �(Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus other things will make her ready for the test also. The story says, �It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center � just as she had known it would feel� (Ho).The feel of the hibiscus @MONTH1 remind Saeng of distsnt memories, like helping her grandmother with her hair. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test she will not fail.	2	3		3																					
3422	4	I think  the author concluded the story like that is because it was cold outside. I also think that the author is trying to say is that when she wrote this letter it was cold outside and she wouldn�t take the test until it was warm again because of the cold. �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again.� 	0	0		0																					
3424	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because if the author trys it again it might work out a lot better now they know what they are doing. Also if they try it again then if it makes enough they can sell it and make money so they will keep doing it for years to come.	0	0		0																					
3425	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with a resolution of Saeng in order to show how Saeng will not give up and how she is determined. The reference to the spring blossoms shows how Saeng will fight to survive through the hardships, which are represented by winter. Just like the hibiscus that struggles to adapt to a new home, Saeng is struggling to adapt to a new country the final paragraph provides a resolution to the internal conflict of Saeng throughout the story by suggesting that Saeng will succeed in taking the test. In conclusion, the final paragraph in the story �Winter Hibiscus� provides a resolution to the conflict in the story, and shows the reader Saeng�s determination.	2	2		2																					
3430	4	The author includes this paragraph inorder to show an end to the story and to  show that Saeng has not given up. Ho wanted to show how the plant and the geese represented the continueation of Saeng�s life in the United States. The geese will come back and the Hibiscus will bud and flower, and Saeng will retake and  hopefoly pass her diving test. This paragraph is not just a colosing but a new beginging of life for geasse, a Winter Hibiscus, and Saeng.	1	2		2																					
3433	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to that she still has hope of finding home and being happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. So when the plant budds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy, that is when she will take the driving test. Also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting acustomed to the new home and lifestyle, �A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks deer and�yes�familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.� Through these examples I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show Saeng assimilation into her new lifestyle, and her acception of her situation.	3	2		3																					
3438	4	Saeng concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows what she has just been through and feels she could go through it again. If she fails the driving test again, then she use the plants to overcome her problems. She @MONTH1 actually pass the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and believes now that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood.	1	1		1																					
3442	4	"The author concludes the story with  ""when they comes back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese reture and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. This quote meaning that once the flower buds she will take the test over again because saeng will have the courage & the will to do it knowing she will pass it. The flower represents something to her that gives her motivation and determination. Everyone has something that modilates them in life to keep them going & saeng has her plant. The author kind of gives you direction & idea where the story going to go also when the flower buds."	2	1		2																					
3447	4	They conclude the story with that because the winter is over and spring is here and it will be beautiful again	0	0		0																					
3455	4	The author concludes this story with the few words �then I will take that test again.� because she wanted us to know that she is not going to give up on something she failed once. She is going to keep going until she succeeds with passing �the test.�	1	1		1																					
3456	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, �It�s flowers aren�t pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. �It shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repition of season upon season�� It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that she�s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be strong and follow the flow of life.	2	1		2																					
3461	4	The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means.	1	1		1																					
3476	4	I think the author concludes the story with that saying because it shows that she is adappting to the new place. It @CAPS1 shows that she isent going to give up. Just like the geese don�t give up flying back and forth ever winter and spring. 	1	1		1																					
3478	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is going to start over and do better the second time around because she doesn�t want to disappoint herself. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3479	4	I think that the author concludes the story like this because it shows a new beginning. When the spring comes, everything comes back to life. Plants grow back, animals are seen again and the sun shines bright. This is a new beginning for them so it can be seen the same for her. She could try again because it gives her another chance. Another reason he ended the story like this is because Saeng loves nature. Maybe when nature is back around her it will give her hope and confidence to pass her test.	1	1		1																					
3485	4	The author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between flowers and the test. To finish with this shows she will try season after season just like geese come back every year. Since she tries to make a??? Shows she hasn�t given up she will keep trying year after year. Also, it says that this girl is determined and she won�t stop trying till she gets it right. Next, this last paragraph can tell you about the whole story. Lastly, I think it gives a feeling for the whole story.	2	2		2																					
3487	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes the story a happy ending how she doesn�t give up and is taking the test again. Also she doesn�t want to disappoint her mom she wants to make her happy and give the test a second chance.	1	1		1																					
3495	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesn�t want the snow to melt so that the geese wouldnt return. Also I think it wants to inform the reader about what Saeng was thinking.	0	0		0																					
3504	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and fortunate. Narciso Rodriguez talks about being so fortunate to have his parents and his heritage of being Cuban. From paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is saying that @CAPS1 was so happy and lucky to have his parents as parents which is the main mood of the memoir.Another mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is happiness. @CAPS1 makes the story happy by saying how great it was to grow up with his family. @CAPS1 also says that his family was a lot of people in his neighborhood as well. @CAPS1 is happy to have a great family. From paragraph @NUM2, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.""@CAPS2 are two moods created by Rodriguez in his memoir."	3	3		3																					
3510	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, enjoyable, and worth living. I say happy because they had family to be with, and other friends to help them if anything. I say enjoyable because the author talks about how they (main character) had the first birthday and first friend. I would enjoy all my birthdays if I was that person and also my first friend. I also said worth living because they had food on their table everyday. And nothing in the memoir said anything about struggling. This is why I explain the mood as happy, enjoyable, and worth living.	2	1		2																					
3512	5	"The author of this memoir created a mood about family. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country the loved,"" this quote tells that the mood created by the author makes the reader realize how hard their pareents work to give their children a better life and education. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"","" this also makes the reader feel like there is a lot more to a family then what it @MONTH1 seem. That family gives one life and teaches love. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" this quote tells that home is not just a place where one @MONTH1 live, but that it is about relationships that are created there. These were some of the moods created by the author in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
3513	5	"The mood created by this author is clearly greatfull. The author shows how he (narciso) could never stop saying thank you. He honestly loved the feeling his mom and dad made him have, and all thengs they did for him. By what the parents did by moving into a place to call home for Narciso made his mood forever endlessly greatful. By Narciso's mood being greatful I mean endlessly thankful for all that he has thanks to his parents. In this short autobiography, Narciso creats the reader to feel, and know he is happy with the life he has. As this short story creats the mood of being greatful. You understand how he feels as you read many times through out this article, ""I will always be greatfull to my parents..."""	1	2		2																					
3514	5	The mood set by the author in the memoir is a home is home kind of mood, like a great family, great friendships/relationships and open arms kind of feeling. He mentions the fact that his parents always helped friends and family in need and how selfless they were towards other people. He talks about how him and his family used to come together and have meals as a family. He says he is grateful for the spirit an generosity given to him by his parents at a young age. He gives the reader a sence of comfort and generosity and he thanks his family deeply for expressing spirit, generosity and selflessnes to people.	2	2		2																					
3515	5	In the memoir, the author created a very upbeat mood. He clearly is very grateful for his family, and had a happy childhood. He pointed out the parts of his home and situation that could have been negitive for him while growing up, but then he cancelled those negitive things out by noting the positive aspects of each situation. For example, in the memoir he wrote about how his family had immigrated to the United States, and how they had good jobs in Cuba, but then had to start all over with low-paying jobs once they got here. He said that this was hard for them, but he found a positive way to look at the situation. He did this by writing about how his parent's situation taught them and him to always work hard, and never give up. So overall, he made what could have been a depressing story, have an upbeat and happy mode. He even made the story teach you a lesson about hard work and the importance of family and giving to others.	2	3		2																					
3521	5	In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the mood and feeling of her home and comunity is a happy and heartwarming situation. Most people who would live in a tiny apartment in the city would say that it was to small and cramped, while they wished for a mansion on the ocean, but Narciso was perfectly happy being in that environment. The way she described it, there were always great smells, wounderful music, and great people around all of the time. Narciso said the man people who contributed the most to her wounderful experience in New Jersey were her parents. They supported and cared for her at the same time they were strugling for money. They never showed sadness and they loved and cared for her. Even though Narciso lived in a small apartment in the city, she and her family show that you can make the best out of any situation.	3	2		3																					
3522	5	"The mood created by the author in ""Narciso Rodriguez""is very calm and happy. The author This very calm and cool. There are no loud or emphasized parts. It is also very happy. It describes a family growing and getting to love each other. Also frends and more family having happy times having celebrations. The happiest line was the last, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple little house into a home."" It also has a very loving tone to it. Anything about a family coming together is loving."	2	3		3																					
3534	5	The mood created by the author showed me to be happy with what I have and to be grateful for what I am givin. I learned this from all the moods the author expressed in his memoir of his life. As I state this is the mood the author expressed.           abd	0	1		1																					
3541	5	"The mood created by the author is a happy mood. I think that it is a happy mood because Narciso is describing his life, and at the end he says he has a happy life. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). I think that this is a happy statement because he is saying that his parents cared so much for him, and they turned what could have been a bad house, into a home. I think that it is a happy mood because of the way he talks about his neighbors. ""It was a close � knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). I think that since he talks about his friends and neighbors so well that it is a happy neighborhood. A @NUM3 and final reason I think it is a happy mood is because of the way he speaks of his family. ""They came selflessly� to give their children a better life� I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"" (@CAPS3 @NUM4 and @NUM5). I think that he loves his family, and love is definitely a happy word."	3	3		3																					
3559	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was ""solidority."" because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their non culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me to today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" also in paragraph @NUM2 it says. ""growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family had nothing to do with being blood related."" This is now the mood created by the author was ""solidarity""."	3	2		3																					
3560	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, these are some examples about the mood in the memoir. First you should always be happy no matter what culture your in. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" located in paragraph @NUM1. It doesnt matter what culture you are in. Second, be happy from where you come from. ""I was born into this simple house, situated, in a two-family, blond-brick, building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey,"" located in paragraph @NUM2. You should be happy from what town you are from. Lastly, never forget who really matters. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" located in paragraph @NUM3. You should always be thankful to you parents. In conclusion these moods are the examples of the memoir."	3	2		3																					
3562	5	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author Narciso Rodriguez, write a memoir about his childhood. In the story he thanks his parent for thier courage in coming to @LOCATION1. As well as his cuban upbringing. He describes how thier house was always full with family and friend and how there was always a big cuban feast and cultural music playing. Finally, Narciso depicts how his community that he lived in was unity and strong even though they did not have the same heritage or background.The mood in which Narciso creates his memoir is very upbeat. He never says anything negative about his family, friend, or community. Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for his heritage and thier will to give him a better life. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1, Narciso uses parentheses to give more background information.Narciso's memoir was a very heart felt story. It made me feel like even through hard times people can find the good in things. This story makes me think of my dad because when things go wrong he can always make a joke or find the bright side of the story."	3	3		3																					
3563	5	"the mood was definatly uplifting and happy. at first when he describes his ""house"" he says within these walls my young parents treated our traditional cuban ""home"". You see how he goes from house to home that then you know is a happy place for them. with their kitchen as the ""heart"" (happy heart) cuban music fills the air/ (which he adores). this is just a verry uplifting story how he was born into a cuban, Spanish, Italian people dealt with racism and his parents are welcoming in their extended big extended family  into sleep eat everything. this is a good family and like he said family is not about being blood related its about loving them the way they come and still be in their homes. their family is without a worry all about love and courage his parenths taught him something special and how you can have more than a blood related family. All you need is a little selfishness and alot of courage."	2	4		3																					
3568	5	I think the mood in this story was sad/happy. I think it was happy because it says he loved to cook  And he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook.  Also In paragraph @NUM1 Its a paragraph dedicated to his parents. I think it is sad because in paragraph @NUM2 it says his parents had very good Jobs but when they came to the united states they had to startover.	2	2		2																					
3572	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created Is happy and loving. In the memoir it says, ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 of people were very close to his family and @CAPS2 found out you don't have to be blood relatives to be family. Also it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS2 is happy his parents moved to @LOCATION1 and is grateful of the sacrifices they had to make do do it. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. @CAPS2 went from Just living there to it being his home. @CAPS2 appieriates all his parents have done to make his life better."	3	3		3																					
3573	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is how she learned the definition of ""family"". She learned the definition of ""family"" at what she calls it her ""simple house"". I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, she says ""It was here where I learned the definition of ""family.' "	2	1		2																					
3578	5	"The mood created by the author is showing even though they came From Cuba they can still make a living and become bilingual and translate and help others Find @CAPS1. For example, ""Often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to got back on their Feet."" meaning the would help some one until the got a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 a apartment that was good for them and for what the make a mounth if they had Jobs. Therefore, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people we considered family"" @CAPS4 each other if the had problems.

3582	5	"The mood created in this memoir was very greatful. Narciso was very very greatful for the ""house that his parents turned into a home."" And he was very greatful to his overall parents, for giving up there own life, to try to give their son a better one, with many more oppertunities than they had. He is also greatful to his parents, not only for giving him things they never had, but things they did have, too. Things like teaching them how to cook, how to treat others, and the real meaning of family. They also showed him the value of being selfless for someone you love."	2	3		3																					
3583	5	No matter what nationality you are you can get along with anyone. He shows that his home, to him at least was a wonderful @CAPS1 with nice smells, food, and people. He is unexplainable happy and grateful for what his Parents did for him. To him it was @CAPS2/heaven on earth. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in the humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not Just scent and music but love and life. He will never forget that house or its gracious neigh bor hood.	2	1		2																					
3588	5	In the author's memoir the author creats a mood and that mood in the story as happyness anjoy. It is happyness and @CAPS1 becuse he was happy for his home and how his parents were cooks.

Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I deal with it to, I get called cracker and n**** on a daily baised, I dont know how I would get through it without family.	2	2		2

3806	5	"The mood in this memoir I believe  is appreciation and caring towards others. @NUM1 home as well as neighborhood was a place of unity and caring for one another like a family. In the memoir it says that people were always coming in and out of the house for a place to stay or for a meal to eat and were always welcomed with open arms. ""Family""  to him didn't mean you were related but were loved and cared for by other and with that mindset he had a huge family. His parent left behind their lives in Cuba where they were both scientists and had friends and family there for their son. They knew that the United States had better oppurtunitis for Narciso (in which he becomes a designer). He states several times how grateful he is of his parents for them to move to the @LOCATION3 for him as well as making his house feel like a home."	3	3		3																					
3807	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is. First, the moon that I think is a warm and and saying there's no place like home feeling. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it states all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship as in home and and the people around us is like family and we come and unit as friends and families. Also Narciso Rodriguez says in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. To finish my describtion of the mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez theres no place like to feel at home."	2	2		2																					
3811	5	"The mood of the memoir is appreciation. I think it's this mood because in the final paragraph the author says, ""... I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS1 fact is, in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 talks about how he kept thanking his parents for everything he had. He states, ""I've often told them that what they did is a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" I guess he is just very grateful for his parents, his childhood, everything and everyone he has ever met, had or done in his life. If I were in his shoes, I'd be grateful, too. This opened my eyes and now, I, too, am grateful for everything and everyone I have in my life."	2	3		3																					
3818	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is emotional. The mood is emotional because his family left ther homeland for the freedom of ther children. They gave up everthing including family for the kids. The fact that they didn't know anybody or the town itself was amazing. Jobs were few, money was sarce. Even though hard times, after there over, it's the best times of all. Family can be in a place with no relatives, That is the mood created by the autheor in the memoir	2	1		2																					
3826	5	"There are many moods in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez. One of the moods are loving ""I learned here how to love."" @CAPS1 mood is caring ""my parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people who were considered family. And @CAPS1 mood was happiness ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations"" That is the mood of this memoir."	2	2		2																					
3829	5	"The mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez's love. Love is the mood for many reasons. One reason is that Narciso's parents were very caring. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM1). Narciso's parents cared about everybody as if they were part of the family. Another reason the mood is love is because Narciso talks about how his parents were selfless. With courage they moved to @LOCATION1 without knowledge of the lanunguage or the culture."" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM2). @PERSON2's parents did everything out of pure love. Because of them @PERSON2 lived a life filled with happiness and love."	3	3		3																					
3837	5	In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood treated each other as family, though they were all struggling to get buy. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot. Narciso's parents had highly skilled well paying jobs in Cuba and they were forced to get whatever jobs they could find in @LOCATION2. They would always help someone in their family if necesary, and often did. Narciso's family made the best of being poor, and managed to get by. They did all this without loosing their culture (Cuban music and food). Their entire neighborhood, one big family, survived and thrived on little. Being a blood relative wasn't the only defenition of family in their part of Newark, New Jersey.	2	2		2																					
3842	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is they had no problem finding a house. for example the author states ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" This means that they are great cooks and have skills for cooking. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us."" Even though they first came to the @CAPS1. S they had no problem finding a home. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This is saying his mom keeps the traditions with all the celebrations for new comers to the @LOCATION1"	3	3		3																					
3851	5	The mood in the memoir, which the author is trying to show you is pretty much the happiness and gratefullness that Narciso Rodriguez has to be cuban. Narciso is bringing the mood of happiness in this memoir learning all about his Cuban background and how much he is greatful for his mom and dad. The author is trying to show you appriciation and gratefulness. This whole memoir is trying to show readers how great it is to come from different cultures and know how to make and do different things. This memoir is representing good moods and happiness. To always be grateful for what you have in you life, exspecially your family, friends, & your life. The mood in this memoir is very happy and gratefull	2	2		2																					
3852	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the author creates a very powerful and posative mood. One strong example of this is how he expresses his parents. He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like ""always be greatful for my parents"",  ""admiration for their strength"", ""perseverance"", and ""generosity."" The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set. Narciso Rodriguez expresses a very positive and powerful mood about his family and his culture throughout the excerpt."	3	3		3																					
3857	5	He is very greatfull to live in @LOCATION1 and even with all the racism he still found ways to have fun and enjoy life.	1	1		1																					
3859	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home."	3	3		3																					
3865	5	The mood of this memoir is a good one. It describes how a house is not the same as a home (last sentence in memoir) and how family is more than just blood relatives.	1	1		1																					
3866	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It symbolizes togetherness and coming together as a family. In this passage evry one is caring and open to anyone living with them. The child in this story talks abou how greatful they are for there parints. Their happy because their all a family living together as one. Evry one is exsepting of one and another. Over all I think the mood is happy.	2	2		2																					
3870	5	"There are Many ways I can explain the @CAPS1 created by the author in the @CAPS2.One way I can explain the @CAPS1 created by the author in the @CAPS2 is That he is so greatfull for having Parents that care about him and want him to get a good edication.The second way is that @CAPS1 is always happy at his home, he always has some cuban spirit in his house. his perents cook cuban food and have There Family together.The third way is that he Loved his house how his perents Made it so confortible and his perents made so many of his birthdays there, he had a great time at that house ""I will never forget how my parents turned his simple house into a home""This are some of the ways I explained the @CAPS1 created"	2	2		2																					
3871	5	In this memoir the mood sounds like a happy one. An example of how you might know this is in paragraph @NUM1 when it discribed what he loved doing with his parents and family. Also throughout the whole memoir you can feel the happiness when he talks about eating dinner with all his family members and friends. One more detail about the mood is that he sounds very grateful for what his parents did and the hard choice they had to make about moving to @LOCATION1. There are some details of why I think the mood of this memoir is happiness	2	2		2																					
3875	5	The mood in the memoir is loving. It is loving because the authors parent's let pretty much anyone in need, come to live in their house. They did this because they knew if they were in need other people would do that for them.	1	1		1																					
3880	5	The mood that Narciso Rodriguez created was a very happy and uplifting mood. It makes you feel like you were there and that you wish your family could be like that. You wish and hope that you could have a life like that where everyone will do anything for you and everyone is so close and they have dinner every night together. He makes it seem like not having any money is the best way to live. That even though you left your family, friends, jobs everything is okay because you are with each other. You are with your family but they are not your blood family. They are having so much fun with people you just met because they are so excited that they made it to @LOCATION1 and they are just having fun with their culture and tradition. The whole neighborhood is one big family they all call the older people who are living in their basement their grandparents when their real grandparents are in Cuba. It just makes you think about your family and all they do for you.	3	2		3																					
3884	5	"The mood of the author Narciso Rodriguez was he was always proud of his culture and mom and dad. For example in paragraph two it talks about @CAPS1 where he lived and how he said that he ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)"". ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). In the story @PERSON2 always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile. And he was positive and honest. And he even talked about his community ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" And Narciso also said ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."""	3	3		3																					
3887	5	In the @ORGANIZATION1. Narciso Rodriguez tells about his life at home when he was a child.

4030	5	This story, basically, brings me back memories myself. In the memoir, the author feels a happy, strong, lovable mood. He feels as @CAPS1 those times, are never going to be forgettable, that he's always going to remember those times. That once he gets older, he will take these good times, as granted. Even during bad times, he will look back. Also he will always be thankful, for what his parents have done, to make his life better, and esier. That way he wouldn't have to life a hard depressed life. Hopefully he will always be thankful for that oppertunity, that his parents gave him. I know that @CAPS1 my parents did that for me, I would never forget them.	1	1		1																					
4031	5	The author set a mood for this memoir. The mood he has set is love and kindness. The reason love and kindness is the mood because he says he loves his parents for self sacrifice so that he could grow up in the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. The mood is of kindness too because he thinks his parents are kind for letting anyone into their door.	1	2		2																					
4032	5	The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir is understanding & love, because no matter where you are, you can always bring a piece of where your from and place it where you are at present. For example his parents decorated the Kitchen in cuban ways and listened to cubin music. Keeping their hintage going. And he realizes how great and hardworking his parents are, how good they've been to him. Also even if your not blood related, when loved ones come altogether, who care about eachother, thats family.	2	2		2

4034	5	"The auther creates a very comfortable and happy mood.

This suggests that Narciso's parents were very caring people, and gave their home a very friendly and welcoming feel. Overall, the author describes the home of Narciso and his family in a very joyful way."	2	3		3																					
4036	5	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, The mood was pretty much the same throughout. The mood in this @CAPS1 of writing was very happy.

4044	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is that hes glad to be born in @LOCATION1. He loves his parents for the sacrifice for making his life easier and better by moving to @ORGANIZATION1.	1	1		1																					
4046	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the @CAPS1 is family. This entire memoir focuses on family. Narciso first describes how him and his family Came to live in a one room apartment. He then said how him and his sister Rawedia Maria are going to move into a three room apartment in the future.In the memoir, Narciso said how his parents came from Cuba as immigrants to the united States.

4060	5	The mood created by the author is a heartwarming mood. This is so because he talks about his parents with a passion of love and respect. To me that is a heartwarming mood. The author talks about his parents generousity, selflessness, and caring ways. In the memoir it says that the parents let friends and family stay with them until they got back on their feet. The author also talks about how the parents left their family, friends, and careers behind just so that the author, their son, could have a better life. If that is not a heartwarming mood I don't know what is.	2	2		2																					
4061	5	The mood that the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The basis of the authors life has been the @NUM1 lessons that his parents have shown him with their lives.

He talks about, how his parents ""... both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me there are rich culinary skills and love of cooking..."" (@NUM2 2.@NUM1-5). This sort of sets up the mood of the narrator being reminisant and grateful of his life as a kid."	2	2		2																					
4069	5	"The mood created by the author was greatfulness and happiness. When the author was talking about his parents and his culture he said ""and for which I am extremely greatful"" ""Which I adored to this day.""

4070	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by ""Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 designer"", the moods created by the author in the memoir are mainly happiness, gratefullness, and being humble. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso mentions alittle bit about his past, and how gratefull he is for what he has today. Narciso knows that his parents try their best to give him a better life. He knew that the move would have to be a big sacrifice for his parents to do so he thanks them often. No matter  were Narciso was, either a good place or a bad place, he always found happiness.

The @NUM1 moods that were mainly presented in the @CAPS2 are happiness and gratefull and all of which came from Narciso Rodriguez."	1	2		2																					
4077	5	The mood created by the story could be described as thanfullness or gratitude. After reading about a loving pair of parents that gave everything they had just for their children makes you feel guilty and respectful of your own parents. The author portrayed that they were grateful for their parents and they he or she knew they would never be able to repay them. From what the author says, times at home financially @MONTH1 have been tough, but because they had such a loving family, everything was alright.

The author also said ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" That is what I think the mood of this memoir is."	2	3		3

4087	5	"In my opinion I think that the author sets a loving mood. Here are my points to consider. First of all he explains how much he loves his parents.

For example ""I've often told them of my admiration for thier strength.""@CAPS1 of all he talks about his family and the love they shared. An elaboration of my point is that he explains what courage they had. For example ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language."" @CAPS2 of all he explains how much his house meant to him.

This family shows this many times in this memoir, they always had people over, like the landloard's daughter Alegria who was Narciso's first friend and babysitter she went over to eat dinner very often.

(I would know my ""real"" grandparents, Narciso the Elder and @PERSON2, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" @CAPS1 also always has many of his aunts, uncles, and cousins for dinner, and ""countless extended family members came and went"" But @CAPS1 says @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family"" which explains why the house was full of happiness but I think the house was full of love because ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."""	3	3		3

Also he says Passionate Cuban music which I adored this day filled the air mixing with the aroma of the kitchen, Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. I mean that the mood is lighthened up a  little when he says all of this stuff.	2	2		2

Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to.

He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2) ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is.

Also, she talks about how ""My parents always Kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them. As you can see, the authors tone in this memoir is calm, and sad."	2	1		2																					
4166	5	"Inthe memoir the author the mood the author sets is a thankful soft one The author is thanking his parents in a good way, in a nice, soft, and appreciative way. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house with a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always fills the air with not just scent and music but life and love (pg. @NUM1). All you need in life is a little imagination and a lot a help and love. This guy in the memoir got a lot of help in love by describing it in a nice calm way, of thanking his parents for all they have done for him."	2	1		2																					
4168	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, and happiness. In the memoir the reader expresses the love and gratitude towards his parents. Not only did his parents love him; they quit their jobs and moved across the world just so they could give their son a better life. The authors parents risked so much for their son. The author states that he is very grateful for his parents, and that there is no way to express the love he feels for his parents. This memoir expresses the love, and gratitude in one's family, and how a little bit of caring can go a long way.	2	2		2																					
4172	5	I think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood. I think this because throughout the entire memoir the author didn't talk about one unhappy thing. In paragraph @NUM1 the author talks about how his parents taught him how to cook and how they gave him a love for passionate Cuban music. In paragraph @NUM2 the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph @NUM3. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @NUM4.      As you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and I think that is what gives it such a happy mood.	3	3		3																					
4173	5	"The mood created in the memoir was very greatful because of @PERSON1's family that nearly gave everything up to have a wonderful life in New Jersey. He was grateful for the talents his parents passed on such as cooking and loved the heritage they had like their interest in Cuban Music. @PERSON1 must've been very grateful to be surrounded by so many loving people like his ""@CAPS1 lord and his daughter, @PERSON2 (my baby sitter and first friend)...(who) graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not"""	2	2		2																					
4175	5	The mood created by the author was very interesting. At some points the author was very serious. He would tell about the hard times his family had and what they went through. Then he would be joy ful. He would explain what his house would be like. He would tell how joy ful his house was and how he loves his parents so much. He would explain what loving parents he had. He showed how his family wasn't blood related at all. His family was different cultures all combined to make one happy family.	1	2		1																					
4177	5	"The mood in the memoir of the life of Narciso Rodriguez is mostly how the bonds between him and his parents, and everyone around them got them through tough times. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 he states that in their neighborhood ""cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" And how ""immigrants extended helping hands to people, who were not only their own kind, but who needed a helping hand."" The author says that in his community many different cultures came together and help each other through racism, and other tough times. He says that ""family"" isn't just those you are related to blood, but those who are close to your heart."	2	2		2																					
4179	5	The mood of the story is different throughout the memoir. During the the parts were he talks about the struggles to get from Cuba to @LOCATION1 the mood is sad depessing. But the mood is different when he talks about how his family sometime gets to gether for dinner when they throw a Cuban party for the relitives who arrived to @LOCATION1 from Cuba.	1	1		1																					
4185	5	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez From Home: ""The Blueprints of Our Lives. In the story the little girl lives in a one bedroom apartment and she doesn't call at home untill she move's into a three bedroom apartment they maybe she will call it home. She doesn't really know adout love & to be kinda Also, to care about people. But at the end of the story she knows adout love she say's ""I will nevere forget how my parents turned this simple house into a hom""."	1	1		1																					
4188	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and being thankful because in the memoir in paragraph @NUM1 when he is saying ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. It means that it doesn't matter if you aren't blood related because it only matters if you have love for one another and you care about one another. Narciso is just saying that he is proud of what he is today, and loves and respects his culture, and that he has people to love and has people who love him back."	3	2		3																					
4198	5	"Home is where the heart is, many of said this and many more have meant it. In the non-fictional memoir by @PERSON1 talks about the importance of family. Narciso pats many moods into the story and describes them with such grace. ""Friends and celebrations both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (paragraf @NUM1) This gives a sence that for him home was the safest and happiest place for him to be. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open the the many people we considered family."" (paragraf @NUM2) This gives off the mood that his home was a very careing place and that anyone that they loved was cared for. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'."" (paragraf @NUM3). This sets the mood that he was never really alone that he had people with him at all times that cared and loved for him like he loved for them. ""My parents turned this simple house into a home."" (paragraf @NUM3)"	3	3		3																					
4200	5	"The mood created by the author was great. He made it so Narciso was very happy, and proud to of grown up in Cuba. He also made it so Narciso was grateful for everything. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful). The mood created by the author was a great mood."	1	2		2																					
4202	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and grateful. He is grateful that his parents give up everything that they had just to give him a better life. In the memoir it says: ""They came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, careers, and the country they loved."" he is happy because he has an opportunity to have a better life and that he learned the real defition of family. In conclusion the mood for this memoir is happy and grateful."	2	2		2																					
4209	5	"The mood the author created was gratefulness. Narciso he is grateful for his parents sarrifice to live in @LOCATION1. This gave him a better life. The auther writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Also, he admired their strength and perverance of his parents. In the text it says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and preseverance..."" @CAPS1, he says that he will never forget how his parents turned a house into a home. That is the mood the author creates in the memoir."	2	3		3																					
4213	5	The mood in this memoir is very happy. It kind of shows how lucky we are, by showing how greatful they are to be hear in @LOCATION1. The mood is also joyful.	1	1		1																					
4219	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, loving, content mood. This mood is created by Narciso talking about what a great and happy life his parents made for him. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. It just sounds so happy and loving to me. He also says things like ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extened a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Thats another example of the loving happy mood in this memoir because hes talking about how people were so helpful and gracious to anyone in need and it makes me feel so happy that people are like that. I really enjoyed reading this memoir because it was all about peoples love toward eachother which set a very happy, light-hearted mood for me."	3	3		3																					
4220	5	"The mood in this memoir is a very relaxed and happy mood. Narciso is always happy in the house, there was always the smell of food, and his parents cooking. There was always a strong sense of family and the house too. In pharagraph @NUM1, Narciso said that ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" What he is saying is that you don't have to be related to be family. Anyone close enough can be considered family. He also felt that you should always help people in need. That is what his parents, they always help people when they need it. and were always willing to share everything they have. That is the mood instilled in this memoir about family and love."	3	3		3																					
4221	5	"I think the mood of the passage @ORGANIZATION1 by The Blueprints of our Lives is a very @CAPS1 mood because in the passage it @CAPS6 ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" I believe this meas that @CAPS2 is thank full that her parents provided him/her with a good home. Another reason I think that the mood of the @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 because in the story the @CAPS3 @CAPS6 ""I will never forget new my parents turned his Simple house into a home I think this means that the @CAPS3 is @CAPS8 and that is the mood I believe the article is about."	1	2		2																					
4222	5	the mood givin by the @CAPS1 (In My prospective) is happy becaus even if you had to move to @LOCATION1 away from his loved ones he still managed to be happy with his family in @LOCATION1	1	1		1																					
4224	5	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by The Blueprints of our lives the mood of the author in the memoir was he was thankful for everything he got so like the mood was quite and loving I picked quite because he has grew up nothing really exciting happened in his life he grew up in @LOCATION1 and his parents were from @CAPS1 parents were very nice people and alway wanted to give their kid a better life and he's alway been grateful for his parents they were the originally parents that made his life not that much excitiing and also picked loved as a mood because in the article ""always filled the air with not just scent in misic but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of family meaning his mood was he felt loved by his family. Thats why chose quite and loving."	1	2		2																					
4229	5	In the memoir, the author creates a mood of love and community. In paragraph two the author describes his childhood home with words like traditional, passionate, and congregation. These words set the tone for the rest of the memoir in which love in helping the community are key themes. It gives me the feeling that I could walk into their home and be welcomed with open arms even as a complete stranger. These themes are reinforced in the last few sentences when the author ends speaking about his gracious neighborhood and how he learned to love.	2	2		2																					
4232	5	"In the memoir ""@CAPS1 Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by @CAPS2 is shocking. First, on page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 Rodriguez wrote, ""I would not know my 'real' grandparents... leave Cuba."" Here, Rodriguez is talking about how she never meat @CAPS2 real grandparents until they left Cuba in 1970. This is important  because early in the memoir she said @CAPS2 surrogate grandparents (Sergio, Edelmira) came to eat dinner. In conclusion,  in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by @CAPS2 is shocking, @CAPS2 real grandparents come to @ORGANIZATION1 in 1970. She wanted to write this because she wanted to teach the reader to know the real deftion of family."	1	0		1

""I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That @CAPS2 that the author did not care that much about house looks, price or its location. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family...

Also, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"". That @CAPS2 right in the quote that @CAPS1 is feeling grateful! The author also puts some phrases in parentheses, just to add a bit more, ""(after which I eternally grateful)"", ""(which I adore to this day)"". Those show @CAPS1 is happy and grateful with his life, and last this next quote @CAPS2 that his ""family"" members were all grateful for each other. ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necissarily their own kind, were clearly in need""."	3	3		3																					
4242	5	The mood created by this memoir is a relaxed caring kind of mood. Several parts of this work emphasize this mood. The author often writes about how he loves his parents for their selflesness. This emphasizes the mood, and he repeats it many times and the repetition helps build mood as well. A final thing that helps the mood is how he describes how everyone in his nieghborhood was kind to each other. In conclusion, there are many things in this work that emphasize a relaxed, caring mood.	2	2		2																					
4243	5	Within the walls of narciso, her young parents created there traditional @CAPS1 home, There heart was the kitchen. Narciso parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on there rich culinar skills to narciso she love to cook. Quite the countrary narciso neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish Italian immigrants at a time racism. her parents came selflessly, as some immigrants will do, to give their children a better life. They sacafised leaving their family friends and careers, in the county they came from I think her memory is a nice, happy one becuase with those memorys she knows what her family went through.	2	2		2																					
4244	5	"The mood created by the author was love from his family The author describes ""a love of (cuban) cooking which is still with me (the author) today"" and how ""Passionate cuban music which I (the author) still adore today."" The author got this love from his parents. Another way the author created the mood of love was by talking about how his ""parents always kept there arms and door open."" I know that it takes a lot to be able to let anyone into your home. The authors speaking very lovingly at this point in the story. The author also says that he ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a loving relationship The mood that the author set during the story was love. I think that this was a really good mood to set in a story."	2	3		3																					
4251	5	The mood of the author and the memoir is greatful. The author is very greatful for his parents. He is thankful for his parents because they gave up their life for him. They moved from their country so that he could grow up in @LOCATION1. His parents quit their jobs and came over all for him. He is also greatful for his extended family and friends. They are the ones who he eats with, plays with and etc. He takes care of them and they take care of him. They are his surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles cousins and friends. He is also thank full for his culture. All his food along with traditions come from cuba. The author is greatful.	2	2		2																					
4256	5	The author creates a @CAPS1 but happy mood and shows @CAPS1 parts and happy parts in the @CAPS2 about a boy whos parents immigrated. his house was what he grew up in and his parents put a Cuban twist to it.	1	1		1																					
4260	5	In this memoir it talks about what the true meaning of selflessness and a home really is. At the beginning of this memoir they talk about how their parents knew the struggles of a life. And would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet. It was at least five years until the parents could afford a decent sized house.Even though his parents left Cuba they still made an effort to keep all their Cuban traditions alive. His parents loved to cook and taught Narciso how to. They also play traditional Cuban music. Also, they taught him to be selfless. They would invite people over even if they weren't the same race because it didn't matter to them.	2	2		2																					
4262	5	"In my opinion the mood is created by the auther in the memoir by the setting and describing her child hood, where she was born and why her parents came here. The reason I think this is because the mood can create this setting, because the mood is the feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, lonely, silent and that is what creates the setting which is where, when, and time of the story. Some examples from the excerpt are, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey."" Also, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" The author is very thankful for her cuban heritage and her home is about relationship then just space. In this memoir the mood created the setting."	3	2		3																					
4264	5	"The mood the author created in this memoir was very proud. I could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language Or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" I could @CAPS1 feel the prid in that because he is talking about how his parents left every thing basicly for him. Also, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to who ever needed help even though they were the richest people either. He gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir, pride"	3	2		3																					
4265	5	The @CAPS1 creates a mood of happiness in the @CAPS2. He states memories of his child that made him happy. He mentions the love that he had of cooking with his parents. He also mentions music as being passionate and that he still adores it even to this day. He also describes how good his neighborhood was and how they were a close knit community. Then he startes to explain that a lot of his family was not just blood related but how it included other people. He then explained that he's parents were very self sacrafising people. So it was a very good mood the @CAPS1 wrote the @CAPS2 in.	3	2		3																					
4274	5	"In the memoir the authors tone is loving. The way he describes his Cuban heritage and culture is full of pride for being Cuban. In @LOCATION1 two he states that he is eternally grateful for having had his parents ""rich culinary skills and a love of cooking"" passed on to him. Then at the end in @LOCATION1 seven his tone is once again loving and grateful. In the very last sentence it is noticeable. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""	2	2		2																					
4278	5	Well first the authur feels happy and exsited but he also feels sad cause he is moving to @LOCATION1. In 1961 he was born but In that time he met a friend which was his Babysitter and she was his first friend she lived up stairs from them he has alot of family members but wen he moved to @LOCATION1 his mom and dad took his people that need a home Just until they can get back up on there feet he wants to see his grandparents that cant leave until 1970. But he told his mom and dad he will always be grateful to them for their love and sacrifice he often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than he could have ever done he also often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance andt he thanked them	2	1		2																					
4283	5	The author of Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso Rodriguez made the @CAPS1 feel happy and welcome. When he talked about the different cultures and races coming together and becoming a solidarity made the @CAPS1 feel welcome to everyone no matter what race you are. When he talked about his Culture and house and having people over for dinner everynight just felt happy and welcome. When he showed his love for his home and culture his parents had shown him made the @CAPS1 feel uplifting. that is how Narciso Rodriguez created @CAPS1 in the memoir, by talking about happy uplifting topics.	2	2		2																					
4284	5	"The mood that the author gives through out this hole artical or, memoir is happiness and family. All during the memoir he speaks of how he cherished his family. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" the author keeps on saying how much he is thank ful to his parents and how he loves how they were able to give him all they had to offer. That is what he ment when he said he couldn never show how much it means to him. The mood in the memoir is love, family and happiness."	2	2		2																					
4288	5	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author talks about the home that they grew up in and the sacrifice and selflessness that their parents have. The mood of this story is happy in the author really shows how much of the love their parents and what they did for them. In paragraph two when they talked about how they love Cuban music and the culinary skills that their parents had, that was passed on to them and that they love so much. Another example of the mood of the story is shown by paragraph four when they talked about all the people they had at their kitchen table and how they were so helpful to the people that they met through where they live. The mood of the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" was happy and loving to all the people this person has ever met from that house."	3	3		3																					
4298	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a family mood. Rodriguez talks about how family always visits. The memoir states ""countless extended family members came and went..."" (paragraph @NUM1). He also explains that family isn't always the people related to you. Rodriguez says that his neighborhood ""came together in great solidarity..."" (paragraph @NUM1). Rodriguez says that he is most grateful for his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Narciso Rodriguez really creates a mood filled with love, caring, and family."	3	3		3																					
4304	5	I think in my opion is that the author was very comfortable with his words and his way of being human. His parents was originally from cuba, @CAPS1 was in to there culture nice to other in there surrounding. For an example @CAPS2 say It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the country and where I celebrated His first birthday.	1	1		1																					
4314	5	The mood created by the memoir is exciting because he likes fashion design. He makes the story about clothing design. He also feels happy because he likes the home and has turned a simple house into home. He felt sad because he was born in a simple house. He wanted somewhere he could call home.	1	1		1																					
4315	5	The mood created by the author was happy, The love Of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. I will always be greatful to my parent, for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could ever done. They @CAPS1 me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life. The author's mood is happy and grateful of there parents to give the author a better life, and leaving what's behind.	2	3		3																					
4317	5	The mood of the author in the memoir are grateful and thankful. Narciso life seem original like others would have. It was a simple house they started, turned to a warmth home. Narciso appreciated his parents brought them to this land, Cuba, selflessly care for their children for a better life. Although they is struggling but they are have happiness. His parents often welcome neighbors and relatives to join the dining. family to him that he be learned is not just his parents, sisters and brothers. It's neighbor surround you and treat you with respect like a family. This is how Narciso Rodriguez felt of worthy to have a home like that. He felt grateful and thankful for his parents love and sacrifice. He admired for his parents strength and perseverance. He'll never forget the gracious neighborhood brought him memories and his parents turned this simple house into a home.	2	2		2

4320	5	The author in the memoir mood was happiness because they bought a New house in New Jersey. They had a born baby in the house her @CAPS1 is Narciso she @NUM1 years old. There family is happy. There parents are from cuba. They live in a beautiful house that has @NUM2 bedrooms.  In hous There, familys are always happy.	2	1		2																					
4338	5	"In this memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the @CAPS1 of Our Lives created a mood that was calming and the author was passionate in what he said and made a happy mood. ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich  culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" This quote shows that the mood was cheerful and calm. The mood the author created was the friendliness of family and friendship between the family and how other people would join them into his family house. The author made the mood like an instilled enviroement as like he was growing up in ""this environment instilled in me a great sense of ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."	3	3		3																					
4346	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is @CAPS1. He tels us his life in past of the hoas he ust to live in and how much hapines it broght hem. He tels us how they cald the people to selebrate when they cam to @CAPS2 ther first ime.

The parents turned a simple house into a home.	2	2		2																					
4354	5	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is certain mood. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful)."" I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also says how grateful he is for his parents. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good."	3	3		3																					
4355	5	"Narciso was very grateful of his parents they had love, happiness, depression and maybe more. The author's memoir was sad, but also a loving memoir. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" Narciso loved his parents for making a simple house into a traditional Cuban home. He also loved how his parents made their own home. ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such corage, they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" Narciso  was so grateful he thank his parent every day that created love. ""It was this simple house that my parents celebrate my first birthday"". He kept the house as a memoir to remind himself of how he came to america. it was loving, caring, and also cheerful."	3	3		3																					
4357	5	"In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writing about his childhood home. Here is what is.Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when living here because like Narciso says in the bottom of paragraph @NUM1, ""In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lifes over entirely, taking what ever work they could find."" @CAPS1 of talking about the hardships, Narciso focused on the fact that he was raised into a wonderfly cultural enviorment. An enviorment filled with his ""family"". When he says family he doesn't meen just her biological family. He means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, greatful, and happy tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and most likely is quite wealthy, he will never forget how his parents ""turned the simple house into a home."" This is what the tone of this memoir is."	3	3		3																					
4360	5	The mood in the memoir swifts throughout the story.  First is that in the begin Narciso wasn't sure he would like moving to @LOCATION1 because it was so different.  But that changed when they started having family over and also using there imagination to decorte there house.  Next is that the mood change in the middle of the memoir when they rellized you can have just a good life in @LOCATION1 then you can anywhere else.  Also, by them having there family with them while in @LOCATION1 made there moods more positive.  Lastly the family's mood was negitive when having to move to @LOCATION1, but once they were there and made there house into a home there mood change immeditly and they were happy in @LOCATION2.  Thats the mood created by the author in the memoir.	1	2		2																					
4367	5	"The mood of the @CAPS1 is happy. In the memior, Narciso Rodriguez describes the happy and fun times of living in her small home in New Jersey. He describes how his family, which consisted of her mother and father turned their @CAPS2 house into a cuban home and opened the doors to other refugees that were going through difficult times. In the last @CAPS4 Narciso explains that this is the home where all her first birthdays happened, and where her friends and family would gather. The message the @CAPS1 was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be. The reason I know the @CAPS3 mood was happy is because, she had wonderful people in her life. Her home wasn't big and fancy but as described in @CAPS4 @NUM1 ""It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees."" In this @CAPS5 he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love. Narciso's once simple house had turned into a home, filled with friends and family."	3	3		3																					
4368	5	"In the memoir I think the mood the author creates is love for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a ""blood"" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family!"	2	3		3																					
4369	5	"In the memoir, the mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez is welcoming and cheerful. One example that describes this is from paragraph @NUM1. This is where he described his neighborhood, saying ""In our neighberhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 this he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from, they always welcomed each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, the author says that his parents came to @LOCATION1 selflessly, to let their child have a better life even though they were leaving their home country. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memorice of his home, where he had birthdays, parties, and family. He said that there was the scent of life and love in the air. For this he is forever grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of ""family."""	3	3		3																					
4373	5	The author of this memoir created many moods. One mood that was felt is happiness because of the way Narciso Rodriguez described his home to be a place of childhood innocence, family, friends, and endless celebrations. Another mood is gratitude for I have never given up my friends, family, and home and Narciso Rodriguez's parents had to give up their friends, family, and home in Cuba to support Narciso. The last mood is admiration at the fact the Narciso Rodriguez and his friends and family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation were a part of the @PERSON2, along with the fact that they were going through financial trouble. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez made the readers feel many moods while telling his insperational story.	3	3		3																					
4374	5	I think the mood in this storie was mostly happy and grateful. Because he loved living there with his parents and having family members around and being able to learn about his heritage. And learn about all the cooking. He seems to have had a very nice childhood and has always thanked his parents for that. they gave up everything to go to america to raise him and he seens very grateful.	1	2		2

They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (Rodriguez, paragraph @NUM1).    This proves how Narciso acknowledges the sacrifice of his parents, and thanks them for it. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states that, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" (paragraph @NUM3).

Though throughout the memoir, among all the of the other moods that are potraid, there is the mood of eternal gratefulness. The fact that the parents went through so much just for their kids to have a better times and a promising future is beyond the relm of words.

""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This made me think of my parents immediately. My father gave up his career and my mother gave up her family to give me and my brothers a better life. This feeling is without words. I can't describe the level of gratefulness I feel, just as Narciso does. Secondly, the admiration I shared with Narciso. She described her parents well enough to put me in her shoes. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS1 thanked them repeatedly."" What her parents did for her was incredible and something to learn from.

Then another example is from paragraph @NUM2 when she tells us that her family stays with her a lot, such as uncles aunts, cousins, grandparents, they @CAPS1 stay whith her until they are able to get on their feet again.

4604	5	"This excerpt called ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a light, happy mood. I say this because throughout the whole story, he is describing all the good things about his parents and his household during his childhood.

When he says this, it gives the reader a good feel of how his parents cared for anyone who needed their help. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he says this, it is another time he is telling us he is grateful for his family.

Also Narciso is thankful in paragraph @NUM1 ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly as many imagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 how thankfull Narciso seems to her parents who sacrificed their whole life for her.

We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And Narciso's case his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love."" Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home"".

That was the mood of relaxing because when you hear music it relaxes you and when you smell something out of the kitchen that you like it relaxes you even more. Also in the memoir it says most of the people in the neighborhood was spanish, cuban, and Italian immigrants which were honest, hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people. That was showing the calmness because if you know everyone of your neighbors are the same you dont have anything to worry about. The last mood is being happy thing that showed that is he was grateful for his parents. In the memoir the author says he is grateful fo his parents love, sacrifice, and courageous.

One reason he loves his family is because, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same."" This means that their family always watched out for one another and protected everyone when they needed help. Another reason he loves his family, his parents specifically, is because they did so much for the author. ""They came selflessly to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This means that even though everything they have known is in Cuba, they wanted their children to have better lives and chances to be happy, so they left everything and moved on.

This why I believe the author is creating a loving, and peaceful mood.	2	2		2

The article gave off a very comfortting mood. As he said in the memoir ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" at nothing to do being blood relative."" (@CAPS2 in the beginning paragraph @NUM1) That quote sets a mood where a little audience in your head goes ""@CAPS3 I never thought of that way before."" This memoir does not give out blunt moobs like happy or sad, It makes you think. There was never a really sad moment in the whole thing. At the end of paragraph @NUM2 he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote is another example of giving a very undefind mood, I say it is undefind because you just cant put it into words of how you feel. So in conclusion the mood this piece gives is undefind."	1	1		1																					
4801	5	"I think that the overall mood of the memoir is a thankful one. Towards the end he says ""I will always grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, he doesn't talk about the bad alot. He only briefly touches on it.

He also says how his family was always helping each other.In conclusion, I believe the main mood in this memoir would be @CAPS1 and coming together wether it be as a family, or as people."	2	2		2																					
4812	5	I think the mood of the memoir is comforting and happy because it talks about how a simple house became a home. The memoir shows how a family can turn a random house into a home would love and by selflessly letting people stay with them until they can get back on their feet. The memoir also shows how family has nothing to do with being blood relaited, it's about being their for one another in a time of need. I think that shows a great amount of comfort and happiness, knowing that a simple apartment could become a loveing home, filled with family and love.	2	2		2

4820	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a sense of family. He says how when his parents came up to Newark, New Jersey, from Cuba, they had to start all over and find a new beginning. They passed on their rich culinary skills and love for Cuban food in the kitchen of a three-room apartment in a two family building. He says that the community was all a different race but they all became a big family that got through the racist times of the United States in the '@NUM1. He says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their extreme love and sacrifice. He reminds them constantly about how grateful he is and that he can't believe how they did it. So the mood in this memoir is about family.	2	2		2																					
4821	5	"In this memoir the mood varies. In paragraphs three and four it was a ""giving"" mood, for example explained in paragraph four ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" It shows right in the sentence that they gave people in need what they needed in difficult times. In paragraphs six and seven the mood was thankful and happy for the sacrifice his parents gave for him. Because of her future.

I think that the moods are @CAPS1 and thankful because there are surten parts in the story where it makes him seem like he is @CAPS1 and throughout the story he is just saying thank you to his mother and father. So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir. Also these are my thoughts on the memoir.	1	1		1																					
4829	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very upbeat happy one. This is because he uses the memoir to describ how happy and upbeat his house was as a child.

4900	5	"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author."	3	3		3

The memoir really shows, ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2."" a person coming here with close to nothing and become a very succesful person.

Narciso infact, cannot thank his parents enough for showing them how important family and friends are.In the end, @PERSON1 realizes that a home is a place you live, and celebrate birthdays, and do work, but mainly a place where everyone is welcome and a home is a family in itself."	4	3		3																					
5007	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is courage. ""I will always be greatful to my parent for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. Another example of courage is how ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in a country they loved. This is the mood the author creates in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
5011	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood -- feeling, rather -- of belonging, ""home"", and comfort. He recalls growing up in an apartment where ""countless extended family members came and went"" and his life was full of people from his community -- cousins, aunts, friends. Narciso recalls that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" -- and there is a sense of belonging. Comfort: ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.""There's also a sense of thanks in this -- gratefulness, one could say. Narciso's parents left everything behind when they immigrated to @LOCATION1 from Cuba -- and as he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And this -- all of this -- creates the sense of ""home""."	3	3		3																					
5015	5	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The @CAPS1 of our Lives"" it tells us about a kid from Cuba.This memoir has a positive mood. It says that they keep family or friends in their home untill they get back on their feet. It tells us about the neighborhood he live in. And how theres many different types of immigrants there and how they all get along. The kid's parents have friends and family over for dinner. The parents give up everything their jobs, friend, and families so that their kid could grow up in @LOCATION1. "	2	2		2																					
5024	5	"The mood created by the memoir is greatfulness. I think this because this is one of the words he uses over and over again to show emphasis. Narciso says ""... And for which I am eternally grateful. (paragraph @NUM1). In paragraph @NUM2 he also says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's memoir states all the things he is grateful for this is why I believe greatfulness is the mood of this passage"	1	2		2																					
5030	5	"The mood is @CAPS1 in many ways. First, the mood in this @CAPS2 is @CAPS1 as if he was happy to immigrant to the @LOCATION1 Also its @CAPS1 as sad, ""... Even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"", another mood would be brave. For me these immigraters are brave because I would never want to leave behind my friends and especially my family. Another mood is greatful. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In conclution, these are many ways the mood is @CAPS1 in this @CAPS2."	2	2		2																					
5037	5	"The mood created in this memoir was manily for me family and Love. for most of the memoir the author was talking about exprens he had in the house, and the love he had's for his family and frend's. The first example I have for the mood is when he say's ""as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."". This shows the parents love for the kids. a second example I have is for family when the reading say's ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great senst that ""family"". and he is talking about thy are all so close nit. This reading was a good example of a closs nit comunity and of parent scracise. for they kid's."	2	2		2																					
5040	5	"The mood of this memoir is nonfiction. The mood is that because Narciso Rodriguez is telling about his past in his and it is about the life he once lived in New Jersey, in a Cuban, Italian, and a Spanish neighborhood. The house was transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with Cuban Aromas and Cuban musics. The mood became joyful because of the Family's love of Cuban Music, and Cuban cooking, (which is really good). The mood also is represented with the Family, a loving and caring family in a nice apartment building. The mood is non-fiction, joyful, loving, and caring, I know this because the ""home"" is so pleasent to be inside."	2	1		2
