1	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lact of information on were to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go.  	1	1		1																					
2	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. He was in the desert, which is dry and hot. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the  temperature was hot and made every thing around him hot, �brackish water faling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Since he was in the desert, there was no escape from the sun. The text  states, �The sun was beginning to beat down�(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out, no one could help him. � and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgous day in June�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town� but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). Thesettings that the cyclist was riding in wasn't good ones and so they negativly affected him; causing him to be dehydrated and tiredin the end."	2	2		2																					
3	3	Everyone travels to unfamiliar places. Sometimes we get lost and ask locals for directions which @MONTH1 not be a good idea. The setting affected the cyclist. He had a perfectly good map but asked older men who look like they haven�t been out in ages. The old men apparently haven�t been out because they gave the cyclist the wrong directions.  My advice would be to not listen to anyone no matter their age if you have a perfectly good map with you. Also try to know where you are going at all times. �Yes, sir!	1	1		1																					
5	3	The setting effects the cyclist because of the setting were diffrent the story would not of made sense. The setting of the story is not and dry with scaterd ghost towns. When he reaches the first �town� he sees �One ramshackle sheds several rusty pumps and a coral that couldnt hold the lamesh mule.� If the setting had the problem of no water so there would be no conflict in the story, �In the story the speeker says �I was travling through the high deserts of California� that are very hot and dry, and he says �This causes the problem of it being hot and dry if the seting was a forest in @DATE1 he wouldn�t have as much of a problem needing water which would of made the story much less exciting.	2	2		2																					
6	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. For instance, it was extremely hot and dry. Also it  was nearly deserted, almost all of the places he crossed were deserted .A  lost her features of the setting were a ram shackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that caldnt hald in the lamest move.an is the feature give you an idea if haw the cyclist feels.  	1	1		1																					
8	3	The affects of the cyclist is if it does not change. it cut hurt a lot of people feeling because they @CAPS1 don�t care about the cyclist. I�m one of them people who does not care about it cause it does not affect me or anyone I know. It is a big deal to write people, some of them @CAPS1 blow stuff up. They talking on tiv and on the radio making all this stuff they say is made up. I don�t believe to I see it. That @CAPS1 not for black people because it has not did anything to us. We really don�t care about the affects of the cyclist.	0	0		0																					
10	3	In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, �the sun was beginning to beat down.� @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drain�s a person�s energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; �The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskie�s story, �Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.  	2	3		3																					
13	3	"There was many features that affected the cyclist such as heat and lack of water. The cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having little water left. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� That shows he wasn�t prepared with enough water for his trip to Yosemite. Without water he/she would die from the heat. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke"" This states that he @CAPS1 the danger of not having enough water in his system. Features such as water and heat affected him/her throughout the story. Not having enough water could make him/her lose more sweat and the heat is making him lose even more sweat which can cause extreme heatstroke."	3	2		3																					
14	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Initially, when the cyclist went through the road with the big snake in the middle of it made him keep cations and very unease. Furthermore, the desert and nothing around gave the cyclist of abandoness and no help for when he is I trouble. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and that people are there. The features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride.	1	2		2																					
15	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by Joe kurmaksie,greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided.The old cotagers told him about a path they thought was right,but was hard and did not get him to the right place.The features of the setting are described as �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.�	1	1		1																					
17	3	Many different characteristics in a setting and determine the outcome of an event there. Im the story, Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the cyclists journey was affected my a few weather relouded things. The heat was an extreme thing that showed him down and in most cases detened him from reading his maximum level of ability. Also the time of your in which this labes place, greatly affects the cyclist. Lastly, the type of road and amount of ground that he has to cover after affects his performance. Overall, setting can be a determining factor in a journey as they life	2	2		2																					
18	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. Since he is riding in the California desert, he always feels very hot and is always in constant thirst. In addition to this the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate. He finds nothing but old abondored buildings. He doesn't find anyone. No people or cars, or any sign of modern civilization. This causes him to feel a little unnerved as if something happened to him nobody would know about it. This is especially prevelent when he become dehydrated. In those ways, the cyclist is very much affected by the setting.	2	2		2																					
21	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, out of date information, and rolling hills. If he had up to date information then he would probably have got water from a town that�s not empty or almost empty like a �ghost town� as the cyclist said.	2	1		2																					
22	3	The cyclist has a couple things if he racing and the wind is blowing then theres a problem and he has to follow traffic law and ride on the right side or the road.	0	1		1																					
25	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time geting to Yosemite National Park. This is because the sun was out, and it was in the middle of June. I was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day. When the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, �somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills"", which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road."	2	2		2																					
27	3	Well I would put it like this is that the weather had everything to do with it because the not weather make you tired and upset and easy to angre so now it make you upset and and then stress.	1	1		1																					
32	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One example is the hot sun that was beating down on him made him very thirsty. Another feature is the rough road that wore the cyclist out and made him tired. My last example is the old juice factory with the picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it made the cyclist feel like giving up because he thought he would die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways.   	1	1		1																					
34	3	Understanding, realitic, mode-all are reason�s how setting affects the setting. If a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good. When you have a setting it�s more understable of what they are trying today. And if you have a good setting it makes it more realitic So when you read it you wont be thrown off, the mode of the story sets it all off, because usually books have there ups and downs. That�s why they chase the mode.  	0	0		0																					
36	3	"The terrain during the cyclist�s journey greatly affects him. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing. The author stated, �I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� This shows that he was energized and happy. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, especially because he had no water left. The cyclist said, �sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn.  This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are include, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did. "	3	2		3																					
38	3	The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren�t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men�s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story.	3	2		3																					
40	3	The features of the settings affect in the story �Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit� it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart. Then..leaves and see these wide bunch of hills. inconclusion I would never do all the riding he did.  	1	2		2																					
42	3	The setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is, �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� He uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says, �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting. He describes the intense heat inthe desert of California, pedaling up, � one long, crippling hill.� The terrain did not make his rideeasy at all. The factor of weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water take a tall on him. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine.	2	2		2																					
44	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist.The features of the setting, or nature, affect the cyclist because they are wearing her out. The cyclist is going to the city of of yosemite but some guys gave her a short cut. Through this shortcut are hills and heat and lack of water. @CAPS1 describes this by saying, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.� @CAPS1 is excited that there is a building that @CAPS1 might get some water from. Also, @CAPS1 wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and @CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. Therefore, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
48	3	"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. �This sight was troubling� when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. �At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1�s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.� He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.    "	3	3		3																					
49	3	Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In �Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit� the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how �The sun was beginning to beat down� expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their �shortcut.� Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with �one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest male.� @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a �battery-acid� flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he �had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.� His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn�t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel.	3	3		3																					
50	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� All the road was hills and rough. Than �The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.� @CAPS1 doesn�t have that much water. That was really hard.	2	1		2																					
51	3	The features of the selling effect the cyclist a lot. One factor that would effect the cyclist would be the heat. Also, because of this factor, he�s pobably suffering from lack of water. He�s probably really hot seeing he�s the only one cut in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles. Another feature of the setting that would probably effect the cyclist is the thought of there @MONTH1 be a car around this next turn. If he can�t see around the next turn he doesn�t know is coming. The cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up.	1	1		1																					
52	3	The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist �traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.� He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank �water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure.	3	2		3																					
53	3	The narration of �Rough Road ahead� a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story. The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite national park from the none of the old men his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his deserve and need for water. The text states �I had been huting my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June�. To disappointed the truck stop�s water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his concumption, only forcing him to link elsewhere to quench his thirst next, he explenced rolling hills by exsercising more energy he made his way now everyone still in need of water. His spend lost his quickness as thoughts of his crippling dyhydration distracted him. He wer came his challenges making his was to a bate shop as the heat beat him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his heath and created a obstraction that nearly deterred him from his goal.	3	2		3																					
56	3	The settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don�t want to be near when you are out of water and tired from pedaling. The time and place affected him greatly because there wasn�t a cool breeze in the air in June at California. He was in the middle of flat deserts and had no sense of where the part as and where civilization too so he can get some water. The quote �old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office� helped you realize taking advice of direction from old people who don�t go anywhere is a bad idea. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills�. This quote shows you some terrail features that affected the cyclist. Furthermore, the cyclist realivingly found civilization with running water.	2	2		2																					
58	3	"I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills� this shows that he is a warm and trobled by the change of the terrain. He also fells alone �I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path� he also. Though he was in a ghost town. �Summer time� rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my detorating brain"" he felt that he was slowly dying. He also though he was losing it, the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was no seeing a mirage. But through it all he had hopes the author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things dont look good keep moving foward never look back and alway's be positive and take advanage of your surrounding. This is the message the author tries to give"	2	2		2																					
61	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
68	3	Setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty not outside causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must have. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED @CAPS1. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isn�t much easier. Anothe way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought of to be a diamondback.	1	1		1																					
69	3	The features of setting  really effects the cyclist because of the condition. For example, the weather, it is hot, it will slow the person down. And if it�s perfect that will let the person go at regular speed. And the roads, if the road is bumpy that will slow them down. And if its smooth that will speed them up. See, it really does depend on the condition.	1	1		1																					
70	3	"The setting affects the  author alot. First he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out. This makes the cyclist very tired. There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one  to help him if he were to have a heat stroke."	1	1		1																					
72	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist�s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly� If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, � I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph� This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story.	3	3		3																					
75	3	The features of the setting affect the cylceist by the ground would change terrian a lot makeing it difficult to ride at the same speed the entire way. Also, the lack of water made it hard to focus. I think the features of the setting affect the cycleist by people think they are worse than the actually are.	1	1		1																					
77	3	In this story the cyclist is going through a desert of California. This is a reason why he is very limited on water supply. It is really hot which would cause him to drink a lot more water. He had started his journey in the morning so that the sun wasn�t as hot as it would be in the middle of the day. Then it started to get a lot more sonny. So with the sun comes more heat. The rider says �The sun was beginning to beat down.� This would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was. This was in the morning so he didn�t realize it but as it got into the afternoon he realized it and started to get dehydrated. 	2	2		2																					
79	3	"The cyclist is traveling through a rough part of California during the hot month of June. The author describes part of part of his journey; ""I was traveling through the high deserts of california in june."" The heat of the sun and not much water around is causing the cyclist to worry about his health. A little further into his journey realizes how bad he could get if he doesn't find water soon. The author write, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke. ""As the cyclist has run out of water & there is no sign of life around, he begins to feel that he @MONTH1 never make it through the desert to yosemite National Park.The author describes this ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. ""The setting of the cyclist""s journey greatly affected how he percieved his journey."	3	3		3																					
80	3	The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the �town� had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this �town� is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road.	2	1		2																					
85	3	"In ""rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Many visual features create a very deserted area thats hott in your head. For example in paragraph five they use alot of adjectives to describe how abandon the place was. Words like ramshackle and rusty. Also how often the lack of water was brung up made us think of how hott this California desert must have been. Also the heat made the cyclist belive he was seeing a miracle when he saw the Welch�s fruit juice factory. The choice of visual words in this story are words to describe what affected the cyclist."	1	2		2																					
90	3	The setting and it`s features affect the cyclist greatly. He is in the desert and all the town's are abandoned. Also he now hits a sign that says �Rough Road Ahead�(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1). This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up, old, beaten roads. And he has the sun beating down and is almost out of water.	2	1		2																					
94	3	In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. �Not two miles into the next section.� He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. �I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� It get harder and harder to continue his ride.	2	2		2																					
97	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the �resevoir compground� he�s feeling pretty good because he�s just leaving �the serenity of an early-summer evening and he�s headed toward �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� He�s in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he�s anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the �ghost town� and the �sun was beginning to beat down� he�s less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, he�s still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once �a thriving little spot.� Next, when the cyclist comes to �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral� he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a �tarlike substance� so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the �rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake� it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom� and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better. 	3	3		3																					
98	3	There are @NUM1 features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobody�s there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist.  Furthermore he�s in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about @NUM2 or @NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobody�s around town in able to help him out or anything. Let�s say that he gets lost and he�ll need direction to get wherever he�s going well there�s nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the @NUM1 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist. 	1	2		2																					
102	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist�s ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it �Over on long, crippling hill�. The word �crippling� is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist�s ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding.	1	2		2																					
104	3	Sun, amount of miles, people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot. Also, he said that he really didn�t seem to notice it through in his mind it affected the cyclist. Next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept,	1	1		1																					
106	3	There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, �several rusty bumps,� is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn�t riding on smooth ground he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also he had a huge lack of water he was water depleted he couldn�t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. �Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,''  this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehidrated, and very tired.	3	2		3																					
108	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if says �there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"". This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around."	1	1		1																					
109	3	The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn�t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
110	3	"The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. The text says, �The sun was beginning to beat down�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The hot sun was making the cyclist sweat. He was losing water. This was making him dehadrayted faster. The text says. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to ride up were wearing him out. He was getting tierd faster. The text says. �I stubled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The modern bathroom had good, cold water. This allowed the cylist to drink from it. The water replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain some of his strength. Then the cyclist could carry on."	2	2		2																					
111	3	In the eassy �DO NOT Exceed posted speed limit,� It is a clear cut for survival as it seems that this man is fighting to stay alive. As l know cyclists pedal for hours at a time and sometimes for hundreds of miles of he was biking where green grass and cool mountains collide the tone and mood of the essay would of beam completely different.He uses sentences such as �� of two hundred degrees, deteriorating brain, birds would pick me up clean and drop from heatstroke.� @CAPS1 all make me want to read further in the essay to see lf he will be ok by thes end of his journey? I know what the feeling is when you are low of fluids because l have chronic dehydrated. I couldn�t imagine biking and only seeing desert hiss and passing tumble weed. It sounds like an awful experience. If he were somewhere cooler and colorful his experience wouldnt of been so horrific.	3	3		3																					
115	3	The features of the setting had misled the cyclist. When he had first left the town where the old men adviced him cyclist had high hopes as a looked and senery enjoyed seeing very ? of the struggle.	1	1		1																					
117	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man�s journey he was confident in his abilities. �I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.�  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June� without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey. "	3	3		3																					
118	3	"The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, �affect  the cyclist in major ways. First, when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, he is reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living. The text states, ��A young   pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung  my head �   (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). The  text later states, "" At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..."" (kurmaskie). This tells that the cyclist feels de pressed and is majorly affected by these sights. This could and would later ruin his self esteem and think about diying."	2	2		2																					
119	3	The cyclist went on a rough journey and he was explaning how tiering it was and difficult it was for him going from town to town having to diel with lack of water poisonous snakes and the condition of the road.	1	1		1																					
120	3	The setting of the essay didn�t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, �a ghost town.� @CAPS1 this couldn�t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is �traveling through the deserts of California in June.� Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels.	3	2		3																					
123	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because, forty miles into the desert, I arrived at the fisrt �toun�. The setting of the desert affected the cyclilst because the cyclist, because cyclist was arising doun the road when the men with the settings came and affected the cyclist. The man was very crazy. Her water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of driead sweat circled my shirt, and ?? he ?? that should drop from heatsroke on a gorqeas day in june simply because I listened to some gentleman who were it been off their ??? ???, ??? to tough. This my responese to the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
124	3	The cyclist trusted a man that didn`t know much about the world, he thought that the guy would know how to get to the place he was looking for. The cyclist took his advice, he thought that he would be there really soon so he start to drink his water really fast. He realized that he was out of water and the park he was going to wasen�t anywhere near. The cyclist got frustrated and angry he was now crossing the desert which was making him tiered and dehydrated. He pased this road that was a rough road with tumbleweeds and snakes he kept on going until he sow the �@CAPS1 Juice� company. He hurried there, went into the bathroom drank same water. When he got out an old men asked if he needed directions, the cyclist said no.	2	2		2																					
126	3	It affects the cyclist because in the begging talk�s ablut the old man. Italso talks about basically saying there information is out of aase also in other words should have just followed his map in the first place.	1	1		1																					
129	3	In the story �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The most challenging problem faced  by the author was the lack of water. � I pumped that handle for several minutes but the water wouldn�t calm down nor I tried a drip or two,it had the flaver of beatterly acid.When @CAPS2 set out for the next train @CAPS2 came to a road that read �Rough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. The tarrain got more bumpy & hard to cross. The effected the determination the cyclist had left @CAPS2 the regreted not listening to the old men of didn�t think they knew what they were talking about. Due to the fact they never left their porches. As you can see the setting most deffinated effected the cyclist in physical or mental ways.	2	2		2																					
132	3	'Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. First off, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle. This affected her because if they had been in a car, or on a bus alot less energy would have been used up. Secondly, the cyclist started running out of water. This setting didn�t help because they were on a bike so that kept them hydrated. Another setting that affected the plot was the deserted towns. If they hadn�t been deserted everything would have been better. These features affected the cyclist a great deal.	1	2		2																					
134	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in most of the story. The heat made him hot & thirsty while the travel gave him a lack of energy and even     of a need for water. In paragraph @NUM1 the writer says one of the hills was �long and a               � The hill was wearing him out & draining what was left of his energy. The setting of the story was the biggest party if the road was flat and bumpy while the tempeture was	1	1		1																					
135	3	The setting easily can affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in which the cyclist was in the seemed to be abandoned which doesn�t give a well thinking to this person . If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won�t be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly infront of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist. The conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him.	3	3		3																					
137	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting. The features are just not right and and they could be changed around a little bit and still have about the same meaning of the essay. So I think they should change it around.	1	2		2																					
142	3	In the story there are many affects the cyclist deals with. He has to go through a lot of bad things just to finish. The cyclist has to watch out for a rough road he was going over. Also the whole time he was racing he had to watch out for diamond back snackes. Also the whole race, the cyclist biggest problem was water. He ran out quickly. And when he saw the factory and stopped. He put rocks in his mouth to make him forget about water, and lets yours split circulate. The cyclist had to go through all these problems which made it show that he had determination.	2	2		2																					
143	3	The features of the setting greatly  effected the cyclist.  He was  riding along   on a  route he had little confidence would end up anywhere. That being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework. The temperature was very hot, where was little shade, the   sun was beating down on him. The route was very discouraging .all the cyclist wanted wanted   was water and the route kept touenting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that approved to be an old bottling factory for Welch�s  grape  juice. The cyclist would appear  to be closing in on something to drink, but be left with nothing.	3	2		3																					
146	3	�Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from California June, but not none the less. Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12. And worse a billboard of �a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,� this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding contributed to his hoplessness.	2	3		3																					
147	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by one, the conditions of the road were awful. Two, the cyclist said there was a huge snake blocking his path as well as the occasional tumble weed. The biggest affect on the cyclist was the lack of water with unbearable heat and he was tired. Those are the affects the features of the setting had on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
148	3	"If I had a choice to ride a bike in California or vermont, it would be a no-brairer to bike in vermont. The temperature in vermont would be much cooler than in California. In the story the cyclist comlains about the ""wide rings of dried sweat"" and the possibility of heatstroke. It is proven that when temperatures rise, you tend to lose more water from your body. Had the cyclist gone to a cooler site at a different time of year he wouldn't have struggled with dehydration on his bike ride. "	1	1		1																					
149	3	The features of the setting in the story affected the cyclist a lot. In the morning when he began his trip, he was eager and determined to get to his destination. Although it took him forty miles to get   the first �town�, he didn�t seem to mind. �The cool pires and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,� is what crossed his mind once the sun began to beat down. Meaning that he   didn�t mind or wasn�t   troubled   by it  at the time. But the farther his trip went, the hotter, and less water supply he had left. Once he passed a couple of �troubling sights�, because they were abandoned and no one   was around, he began to worry. The cyclist got to the point that he stated to suck on pebbtes, in order to circulate the last spit he had in his mouth. In his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on. When he arrived at GARY AND @CAPS1�S FISH CAMP,  his   emotions, and mind changed from begin lugubvious, to becoming thankful.	3	3		3																					
150	3	During his cycling trip, the author had to endure extreme heat, face snakes, deal with little or no shade and survive a dire lack of water, all problems related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes of becoming dehydrated, and describes, �the sun was beginning to beat down and l was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 struggle for him was crossing the path of a �ridiculously large snake� and �trying to keep his balance in his dehydrates state. Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme heat, and upon reaching a water pump, finds the water to be unfit for drinking and �in the neighborhood of zoo degrees.� @CAPS1 setting-related issue for kurmaskie was the fact the area seemed deserted and he had to continue for mile until he was able to find a spot with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate.	3	2		3																					
155	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn�t have much water to drink.	1	1		1																					
157	3	This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills. Another example would be �high deserts of California in June.� That�s saying its hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the �summer time� its very tiring. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  	1	2		2																					
158	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster. The road might be up the hill so he @MONTH1 go slow. There could be a possibility that the road might have bump rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through. So the affect of the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made.	1	1		1																					
159	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink.	2	2		2																					
163	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The @LOCATION1 desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist. For example the was further route, he takes is not only @LOCATION1, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he @MONTH1 restock on water and become hydrated once again.	2	2		2																					
166	3	The cyclist knowing not where he was going got a wrong enformation and he followed it. He was excited to know that he knows where he�s heading too. Along his journey he was aciccted with a lot of things like the sun. The weather condition of their exaction and the big snake he saw. He was affected by sun because he was dehydrating and he almost had no water left for him as it was also becoming so hot alike makes the journey very difficult for and made his mood strange while also following the direction he was disfernded by a big snake he encounter at the case slic desn't while succeed their add was scared that he was going to be attacked unlike anyone to make his way through. The features affects him because he doesn�t know where he was going and he wait a as her cut.� Then he was going to wrong direction and he wasn�t prepared for the journey because the weather condition was� summer time� it was hot and he was riding a bicycle not a car.	3	2		3																					
167	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he�ll have later on. As he passes a snake, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� So the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, ��I could drop from heatstroke�� meaning he�s starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. Which effects him because he�s beginning to loose hope and  thinks he�s not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�� By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story.	2	3		3																					
168	3	"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of no  where that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those @NUM1 also said, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (@PERSON1). I dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work."	2	2		2																					
169	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist. The setting takes place in June. It is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated. You can imagine how hot it got when it said, �wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage.� It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down	2	1		2																					
172	3	In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions were from elder men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to decide which way to take when there was a fork in the road. He chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into flat roads that went to rolling hills, snakes blocking his path, and a dehydration state that could�ve killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
173	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist in various different ways. First of all he listened to the old man so he was on the wrong path. So he travels and it�s a hot June day in California deserts. The odds are against him from the start �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June��(Kurmaskie @NUM1) From the ganle you can tell that hes tired and almost out of water. It puts a lot of strain on the cyclist but he manages.	2	2		2																					
178	3	The feature�s of the setting affect the cyclist because, the cyclist is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he�s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn�t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. �Rough road ahead.�  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
180	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit, the faetures of the setting effect the cyclist. To keep cool on a hot summer day, is might be neccessary for one to find shade. Just to add to the misfortune of the story. There was no one in eight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" This factor does not help the cyclist at all, infact, all it does is make the cyclist more  exhausted. Another element in the story that effects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tatalizing sips."" With more miles to go,the cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to  add to his misfortune, ""flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the hills are short, they still could have put impact on him because of the ropolalive hills. Many features of the story effected the mood of the story."	2	3		3																					
181	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. It affected him because it was saying @NUM1 miles and then were in the first town, thinking that the cyclist was getting excited and he was kind of all most done he thought he was going at a fast past. When the cyclist got to the first town he said that it looked dead. And then after he kept moving he kind of knew that he wasnt getting anywhere. Then after thinking he noticed that he had listened to some old folks that had never even been off their porch. So after the cyclist had hit the first town he had known right then and there that ho should never listen to old folkes ever again. Because that first town had looked like nobody has been in it for years.	2	2		2																					
182	3	The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.� This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration.	2	1		2																					
183	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, the road could be bumpy, and the town could be deserted. For example, ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty. And if he is not and with no water he probably could  barely make it up the hills. And with no town for water he would be thirsty.""First ""town"" This place might have been a thriving little spot at one point but anthor warning it fit the outsides of ghost town"" No waters"	2	2		2																					
184	3	Hot, lack of water, lost-all are how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, it was hot. In one sentence he say the sun was beginning to beat down. Also that the water felt around two-hundred degrees. That sweat was all over him. So he had to be really hot. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performence. How was because he was dieing in need of water. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong and the trip wasnt what he expected. But in the end he was relifed. So even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive. Basically this story is explaining how if you try your hardest, never give up, and try new things you are most likely to succeed in life and other things you @MONTH1 take part of. So try your best and make way of your life and plans in your life.	2	2		2																					
187	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his trying biking trip through California. In the essay, he describes the weather with �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� While this @MONTH1 not directly characterice the weather, the reader can confin a clear image of the sweltering heat of a desert in the summer. When the author comes across the �ghost town� followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read �Rough Road Ahead,� his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.�"	3	3		3																					
188	3	The setting affects of the cyclist was that the exhaustion was getting to him. What made it worse he was out in the heat sweating which also cause dihidration.	1	1		1																					
189	3	To begin with a feature that affect the cyclist was a lack of water this is shown when the speaker says when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid-thats was one of the biggest factors he had risked. 	3	2		3																					
190	3	As the reader listened and followed the directions of the old-timers he faced many issues and also learned a leason. As he began to ride into the day break of morning he had strong legs and even a smile on his face. As time went on he soon became close out of water and a loss of energy. The @CAPS1 summer day made him sweat and began to think that he birds would pluk at his body as if he would die on his ride to Yosemite. When he finally got to a town he soon refreashed and learned that he would and start to began to follow his own way: of getting to places	2	2		2																					
194	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit.� The cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does. The narration states, � a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit � sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie). Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist making him tired due to lack of water and sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die.	2	1		2																					
195	3	Some features of the setting setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said �I wipe the sweat from my eyes.�	1	1		1																					
196	3	The setting had a huge affect on the cyclist. One affect was the lack of water in the area he was in, which was a dessert. Also, the lack of people in the area didn�t help the cyclist out at all. The hills on the road made it more tougher on the cyclist because it drashed what little energy he had left. Also, the sun beating down on him made his body more warm and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do.	1	2		2																					
199	3	In the story the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest problems was the terrian that he had to maneuver them. The terrain was hilly, having to go up a hill on a bike is tireing and wears you out faster than flat land would, and making him use more energy. The heat was also unbearable making it harder for him to focus, the cyclist did everything he could to keep consiese while  manuvering threu the terrain and deserted landscape being a huge desert of rolling mountains he pushed forwad, finding no civilization anywhere to get a refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn�t as hilled then it would of made it easier for him using less energy and less strain on his legs, the heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress also. Heat will make you move slower and a cyclist moving down a  barnest road with no shade will make the journey seem longer, and imposible. In the end his will and determination got with threw the landscape, so he could get the water he needed to finish his trip	2	2		2																					
202	3	In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, �denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.� This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, �denyoyed� One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, �At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke�. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically.	3	2		3																					
205	3	The terrain in �Do not exeed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, �I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.  	2	3		3																					
207	3	The cyclist has it hard in the conditions lack of water, heat and rough terrain are all things that made his ride harder. First, the lack of water took a tole on the amount of energy he had to keep going. Secont the heat also affected his trip It mad it hard for him to Keep going he thought he would die. And the birds would bick at his dead body. Last the Terrain didn�t help. The trip had many hills and that used alot of energy so I made it harder. In conclusion those are things that worked against th cyclist.	2	2		2																					
211	3	The features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing. It might make you want to go faster and left out your inner speed demon. That�s all I can really tell you. Because personally I don�t think the setting of where you ride your bike doesn�t even matter. Possibly for a bicyclist it can, but to me I don�t even think so.	1	1		1																					
213	3	Theres many features of the setting that affect the cyclest. His dehidration started with the sun beeting down on him and the thirst for water. He was mainly affected when he was out of water and road by an abbanond welchs grape juice factory. �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.� Then when he had almost nothing left he spoted a bait shop.� Somehow I climed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.� @CAPS1 is when he saw �Gary and @CAPS2 Fish camp � If you want bait far the big ones were your best bet thus realcaving his troubles.	2	2		2																					
215	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun. The heat dyhydrates and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor. It takes up the time and energy he has to preform. Another key ingreedient of the setting was the desert. There was no one to help him and there wasn't a place to get water. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story.	1	1		1																					
216	3	The setting affects the biker in many ways. For one, he is riding through the high deserts of California during the month of June. It is naturally hot in the summer, but in the desert, it is twice as hot. This means he will dehydrate quicker, and will need more water. The only water the biker can find is from an old pump, but he couldn�t drink it since it was so hot; nasty tasting. �When I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acid� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was deserted, so nobody could help him. Also, the terrain was bad. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. �the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,� (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous. The biker is being affected in many ways, both mentally and physically.	3	3		3																					
217	3	  The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist was faced with a desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die��. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst. Over all, the setting caused the cyclist major problems, physically, and mentally.	3	3		3																					
220	3	"On that long bike ride the cyclist was affected by the setting. He was affected of the lack water, the heat and the bad directions, throughout the story the cyclist ran out of water due to bad directions from some men.""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride.� I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men.� Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information. But not the land has changed and the directions were wrong. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help. The cyclist experienced how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal."	2	3		3																					
222	3	The cyclist in this essay was a very brave man. He had many obsticles in his journey but he still made it. Nature was most definatly not on his side that day. He had to ride his bike up and down hills several times which wears you out very quickly�. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, �After he got threw the hills, he came to a sigh � ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT�.  Now he has to go through bumply roads. �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me�. Now the poor guy had to deal with snakes bigger than him! Thankfully he got by the snake, alive. �Over one long cripping hill, a building came into view�. The man thinks he found someplace to get water, but its an abonded building . �...,by the looks of it � and been a welch�s grape Juice Factory and botting plant.�.	0	0		0																					
225	3	"In the piece, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many  ways. The cyclist felt black humor, despair and then relief due to the features of the setting. The cyclist felt black humor, due to the features. This was because it was very ironic were he was. It was a hot desert and he needed something to drink. He passes a closed juice factory. This spasked his black humor The cyclist felt despair due to the features. This was because as far as he  could see, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind. ""This gave him the feeling there was no chance he could survive. This made him despair. The cyclist felt relief later on due to the features. He eventually got to a bait shop. When he was this live and so he felt relief Of this is, ""Then as easily as  ?  ?  ?   hobbles, thirst and fear were all behind me. In this piece the features were determined how the cyclist felt."	3	2		3																					
228	3	The setting in this story is important because if you don�t have a setting then this will not make sence, setting is something everyone can do. It can be anywhere or anything. The setting helps puts the whole story back together. The setting in this story is @LOCATION1 spending time with his family. Setting is a very important part in a morvie/video.	0	0		0																					
229	3	the way I would set my affected cyclist is by him riding throught. Something u would never thing he can set thought then over coming his intention.	0	0		0																					
230	3	The features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead� affect the cyclist. The cyclist started at a camp ground and conversing with some old dogers, and he asks them how to get to Yosemite, and the tell him a shortcut that turns out to be out of date. On the road to Yosemite he sees nothing except abandoned towns. He is really thirsty and there�s no water anywhere. He thought he was going to die. He said, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It was a hot summer day and there was tumbleweeds and snakes by the road and him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it was cooler and if there was a big river flowing by the road. But it was hot and dry in California and desert-like and it made him feel like he was dying because he was in the middle of nowhere therefore the setting affected the cyclist	3	2		3																					
232	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclist�s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up �Ghost towns� and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says �what I believed was my last burst of energy,� �I was going to die.� The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die.	2	2		2																					
233	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason the features of the setting affect him is because it is hot outside which makes him need more water. An example of this is �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 example of being hot outside is �A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� 	1	1		1																					
234	3	It the short story �Rough Rode Ahead� a cyclist is pushed through an extremely harsh setting  trying to get to Yosemite National Park. In the story the narrator takes a trip to Yosemite National park after getting directions from two older men what the narrator doesn't know is that the road ahead is indeed rough. One narrator states �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated @NUM1). The narrator is really really taking a beating from the travel and this rocks, dry climate is really takens a tale. From reading this story the setting does not do any good for him other than the general store he finds in the end. Like the title states the setting of this story was a �Rough Road Ahead.�	2	2		2																					
236	3	Being a cyclist and in the condition he was in would be even worse in the setting he was in, such as the heat of California, and difficult condition of the path he was on. Him being so hot and tired from the difficult hilly trail would be worse with having the lack of supply of water. The author was very dehydrated and was on the verge of fainting. If it were not so hot, the cyclist would have been in a much better condition.	1	1		1																					
237	3	The cyclist in the article almost died from dehydration and heat stroke and wrote his misadventure in a light hearted, humourous way. I commend him for almost dying and laughing about it and then turning around and blaming it on old people. He is an inspiration for reckless young folk. Oh yeah, and the setting was a desert.	1	1		1																					
239	3	The setting was affecting the character, because as the day got hotter he got thirtier. Also because when he got to the sign about rough roads ahead. He started to get worried and kinda paranoid, so that�s how the setting affected him.	1	1		1																					
240	3	There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town there wasn�t any real water he could drink. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty. Also, it�s the middle of June in California, it�s very hot and size and the is going to wear him out pretty quickly. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says �Over one long, crippling hill�, he�s saying the hills are very hard for him. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story.	2	1		2																					
245	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who haven�t seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldn�t have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldn�t have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his �dehydrated state.� I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldn�t focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldn�t get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite.	3	2		3																					
246	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist in many was it was like a crazy maze, the road he was own, and him not really knowing were he was going didn�t help him, or not having enough water. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
247	3	"The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worst he personally felt. For example, when he hit the ghost town, he just laughed. Once he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of once exisiting civilization, and he says, �This sight is troubling,�. Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him. The climate in the story also becomes @CAPS1 difficult. The land at first was flat and easy to ride, as it got harder to bike on, the cyclist grew @CAPS1 wary and delievious, but knew he had to keep going. The area in which the cyclist was in, had an enormous effect on him emotionally."	2	3		3																					
250	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very serious way. The features cause him to consider he @MONTH1 die soon, as well as present a variety of challenges to him. The setting takes place in the deserts of California, in early summer. There are no other people in there, no establishments, towns, etc. ; @CAPS1 dangerous feature of the setting in addition to it being in a desert in summer, for example the author is the town learntedat �might have been a thriving little spot at one time-sat, before the last world war�. The cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water. For example he says �I was going to lie�slowly gaining elevation while losing hope�. The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives. He lerns, because the setting the setting is now lifeles and deserted, to not listen to old people who remember the current setting on if as it was many decades earlier. Because the features of the setting nearly kill the cyclist, the cyclist learns a lesson. 	3	2		3																					
253	3	"The cyclist on her trips sees a lot of features that would discourage her. She is riding in high desserts of california in June"" (kurmaskie). We all know desserts are steaming hot and dry especially in june. She also encounters hills (kurmaskie) to make matters wose she was travelling on hills in the extreme heat.Though the cyclist goes through many perilous obstacles she makes it to a camp a lives I could seethe horizon, telling myself that I could make it that par, I'd be fine.""(kurmaskie) This shows the author's dedication and that if you don tgive up you will be fine."	2	2		2																					
254	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� the setting is an all- important factor. The author feels the need to describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details each place he stops, such as in �one ramshackle shed�and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule�� and �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite�� In a story such as this setting is of great importance especially since it is so rapidly changing. The story itself would be of much different quality likely for a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past, this story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is.	1	1		1																					
255	3	The setting of the cyclist was harsh, the weather was too intense to be cycling your heart out all day  .	2	2		2																					
257	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the mans ride gets pretty rough. Because he took the old mens advice on a shortcut, the once enjoyable ride became a  "	1	1		1																					
259	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned �@PERSON1�s Grape Juice� factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets �old timers and the give him a �shortcut� to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their �shortcut.� While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. �It din�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.	2	2		2																					
260	3	The features can affect the cyclist very well or not. I depends on what condition happening. For example, he could fall. Does he have a traveling first aid kit.	0	0		0																					
264	3	It affect cyclest because the condition determines the pace and even how fast they could travel.	1	1		1																					
268	3	The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes �that the old men would have been right,had he been riding,� before the last word war.� But any �town� he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says,�It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� @CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, But �hope was fading.� Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who haven�t moved from their front porches in years.	1	1		1																					
269	3	The harsh setting in �DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit �by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to �Yosemite.�	3	2		3																					
270	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hottnes of the deserts of California because the cyclist was sweating, and drinking his water bottles. Also when the cyclist saw the building, he thought he could rest and maybe get a ride to where he was going but, the building was abandoned years earlier so the cyclist couldn�t stop. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
272	3	"The cyclist surrounds did have an affect. In paragraph two the cyclist describes how �I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening the."" To have a wonderful day to begin with was parably assurance even thing would be fine. Confidence was a factory for the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut. In paragraph @NUM1 the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out �this breezy jaunt.� The cyclist just thought his life got a little easier. Then in paragraph @NUM2 the cyclist comes upon the ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This setting was nothing like the old men were talking about. ""Twenty miles up the road, i came to a fork of sorts."" In paragraph @NUM3, this caused confusion and worry. ""This sight was troubling."" ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclist was ""hitting my water bottles pretty regularly."" This setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the ""two hundred degrees."" The cyclist then began puzzled and distraught. ""I notices the terrain changing"" in this quote the cyclist's settings @MONTH1 have caused confusion. But in the end the cyclist suceeded. "	2	3		3																					
273	3	The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, affect the cyclist because the cyclist is in a desert with no water and trying to find a town there is further than he thinks. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This shows the cyclist did not have much confidens in this desolates area of the jerny.  	1	1		1																					
278	3	Almost all of the cyclist�s surroundings are old and barren. Hot @CAPS1 like weather. The road is hard to ride on. �Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills.� So his ride was a very rough and tiresome one.	1	1		1																					
280	3	If the sun had not been so  blaring all the road so trecharous. Also the �devation� often bothers the author because he had to get over the dry and dehydrtion.	1	1		1																					
281	3	When cycling or doing any outdoor sport, the setting matters greatly. If its cold you need a jacket. Hot you need water. Depending on how secure it could be life or death. It could be realy hilly and you might get tired, and if you have no water you could die. Also it depends if its in a city burbed, small town, desert, highway all these factors play a huge roll in cycling	3	2		3																					
283	3	 In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is that he is cycling �through the high deserts of California in June�(Kurmaskie). This affect would mean that the author would be dehydrated faster. The cyclist, author, is dehydrated before he can make it to the next town because he �gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in [his] mouth�(Kurmaskie).	1	1		1																					
285	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the @DATE1 then his water supply would�ve lasted longer and he would�ve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would�ve died. Luckily though it wasn�t and he was able to drink water.The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice something the cyclist could�nt do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him. Since I�ve fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy. 	3	3		3																					
286	3	"The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� @CAPS1 the cyclist's physical and mental state. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1�s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the �Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, �he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless� when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now �behind� him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist�s physical and mental state. Setting @CAPS1 the cyclist�s physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story."	3	3		3																					
287	3	"He setting made the cyclist feel lonely. The cyclist lost hope quickly because she was never saw any people or water on the way. The cyclist said they saw a �ghost town�. Before he got to the fish camp the cyclist saw no one and was becoming dehydrated. This caused him to lose hope and at some points he thought he was going to die. For example, he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It is clear that the setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way."	2	2		2																					
294	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. One way was because of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. With the cyclist having limited amount of water effected him to. The cyclist listened to the old men so therefour he traveled a good distance. So that made matters bad. With having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst. The cyclist thought of him dying and the birds picking him clean, because he thought he would die because dehydration. The conditions of the road made it harder, First he started with nothing but straight roads then ended up going up and down hill. In conclusion, the cyclist hit many obstacles that made his trip harder then what he thought.	2	2		2																					
296	3	"During the cyclist journey he was faced with many ?? ??. Mostly the driver ?? and out of water. In the essay it says how he arrived at the first town and was in search for water. It said ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way. "	1	1		1																					
297	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because of the bad conditions of the road and the not sun and the desserts and the low amount of energy supply he had left the reasons why  	1	1		1																					
298	3	As if along bike ride through the city isn�t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. �High deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good.	3	2		3																					
302	3	The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn�t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life.	3	3		3																					
305	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they figured that they were old enough and seen what was going on and been through that situation that they were well experienced and knew more about what was going on so the people should listen to them.	1	1		1																					
306	3	After the cyclist spoke to the �old timers who hadn�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,� his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and �tested like battery acid�. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and �ridiculously large snake� and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn�t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded.	3	3		3																					
307	3	"The features of the setting affets the cyclist in afew ways. For example, the features of the �Rough Road� didnt allow him to arive as fast so was drive @NUM1 on a @NUM2 speed limit. Second the fact that he was drivuing through a desert a large snake made its way on the Road, causing the man to have to ""ease past, trying to keep my balance in my dehidrated state.� @CAPS1 again because he was driving through the desert,hegot so hot & started to get dehydrated of lack of water. Lastly the features that there werent any buildings far miles so he was left lost and didnt have anywhere to stop & ask for directions. These few features defenitly affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
308	3	There were many features of the setting that affect he cyclist to make his difficut journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise. For example, �I followed their advice and launched out at first line, nd along a �short cut� that was toslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.� This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed @CAPS1, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate. For example, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death. For example �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June�� This is stating without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die.  	2	3		3																					
309	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting often affects the character. One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me�. This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was confused. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels @NUM1 degrees. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� That quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. ""@CAPS1 road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made the biker have to work harder, and use more energy. These conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination."	3	2		3																					
310	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,� affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was �traveling through the high desserts� which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, �trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.� From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into �A far like substance� The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
311	3	The conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist. The conditions were that, he had to save as much water as possible and keep himself hydrated at the same time so that he wouldn�t dehydrate himself.The features of the desert like land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there. You can never predict what they�ll do.	2	1		2																					
313	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn�t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
314	3	During the cyclist�s trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the �shortcut� was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, � there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn�t anybody nearby to help him and there wasn�t any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie�s physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, � the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke� This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. 	3	2		3																					
315	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie�s, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""This sentence from the text stores he is dehydrated, because of this it creates an obstacle he must face. Also, another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is, the rough road ahead he had to face. �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign I would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead. Luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well."	2	1		2																					
316	3	There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One feature is the climate. When you are cycling and it is really hot you can dehydrate very fast. If it is really cold it is harder to breath and catch your breath. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep than you will get very tired quickly and when it is rocky you have a posablity to fall off the bike and hurt yourself. Last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist. Also if the road is so isolated and you get hurt who would find you. This is another deadly situation. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
318	3	The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didn�t have enough space to carry a lot of water and rod to make portrons to drink. Also listening to old guys who didn�t know much didn�t help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel	0	0		0																					
322	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, �I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved @NUM1). Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a �ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, �Telling myself that of I could make it that far, I�d be @NUM3). The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
324	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When in the essay it states, �The sun was beginning to beat down� This shows that this affects how he feels when he is cycling through the road and this can affect his ability to keep cycling while the sun ??? him hard. Also when he states �I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,� this shows he was also dehydrated once goin, very slow because of the ammount of heat and lack of water that affected his ability to keep cycling in the area.	2	2		2																					
326	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.	1	1		1																					
328	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because, it is hot, and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle, hot and dry with bad directions, and in a desert is bad. It was a long distance ride, in the burning hot sun, with little water, and he thought he was going to die because there was nothing insight. 	1	1		1																					
329	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one. For example in the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist had to endure going over big dirk hills while being dehydrated and tired from biking miles and miles to get to a destination. The setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up. The cyclist in the short story; started to lose hope until he found a store that sold fishing bait. The setting controls how long it takes you to getts your destination and how you get there. For example, if you come across a dirt road and theres a big boulder in the way, you have to find another way to get there. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways."	2	2		2																					
330	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says �wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.� The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign �Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it.	3	3		3																					
332	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because it�s almost like the background and theme of the cyclist The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. He�s showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much he�s indespair at the time. When he says �It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� In this quote he is saying that he @MONTH1 be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows he�s not in a good shape and he knows he�s in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do.	2	3		3																					
337	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.	1	2		2																					
338	3	The features of the setting affects the setting by all the big hills, and all the roughness of the roads. As the essay says ''flatroad was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I crested the first few of these a large highway sigh jumped out at me,� prety much what it is saying is the flat road soon turned into rolling hills. If I was the cyclist riding up the hills my legs would get very tired and sore after a while one example, is when my friend ,@PERSON1, and I went  bike riding, we went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, in fechmisburg, and we had to ride up a big hill, so after a few pedals our legs started hurting, so we decided to just walk go the hill.	1	1		1																					
339	3	There are many ways in which the setting of �Rough Road ahead� affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a problem because it is very dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� It is obvious here that lack of water is affecting his in a big way. He almost collapsed because he is so thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Since there was rolling now, the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop. Lastly, the �rough road� affected the cyclist. The road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so I could renew my energy. The heat, remotness of the area, and the rough road all affected the cyclist on his journey. 	2	1		2																					
342	3	@CAPS1   the  story  the  condition of  problem  often effected the mood of the cyclist . For  example when the sign said ,” Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.” @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated . The dry and hot climate began to become problem for the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
344	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the �beautiful @DATE1.� He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. But that�s not the worst of it. The hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker. There are also no places to stop for water. The cyclist is lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California.	2	2		2																					
347	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit,� the featurs of the setting had a great deal to do with the cyclist. The rodes were bumpy, windy, and many hills. As the effect of that the cyclist had to drink a lot of water. As the cyclist rode into the so called town he found nothing, as he says �I began to pump the old rusted water pump, but nothing came out except nasty blackish water."""	2	2		2																					
348	3	The way the features of the setting effect  the cyclist in what was, going through hot neighborhoods and very road that made her dehydrated and effected her journey including the long cycling which he had to go up.	1	1		1																					
349	3	In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit�(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end.	2	2		2																					
350	3	The features of the setting in the essay entitled �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist in an tagonizing manner. He is dehydrated and exhausted due to the conditions of the environment he was in. the cyclist became dehydrated because of not only a lack of water, but also the scorching heat of the desert. He sweat to much to the point that he lost an enormous amount of bodily fluids. The cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved. Therefore the cyclist became so exausted that he almost died. These are the ways the environment the cyclist was in affected him.	2	2		2																					
352	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, �sometimes life can feel so cruel�, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, �somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey"	3	3		3																					
353	3	The features of california and the fact that the cyclist was neave Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous to the cyclist california has a very hot climate, and is neove  a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater man if the had been cyclist in @LOCATION1. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to � short, rolling hills,� which would have made it harder to pedal, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mention how the sun was beating down on him, and that would alos serve as a factor thout helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problem the cyclist faced nowever, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through. Also, in the story you @MONTH1 notices that in the different stages of his struggle, the authours tone ananger from confidient , to unsure, to desser	3	3		3																					
354	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It made him tired thirsty and he was near exaustion.	3	2		3																					
359	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist quite durastrely. First of all, he was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� He was running out of water and the pump he found only produced.� brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. �and� had the flavor of battery acid.� Then he came upon �rolling  hills� and �Rough @CAPS1.� By the end, he was exausted, dehidrated, and in desperate need of water. The turain made the story more meaning full in proving that you souldn�t get directions from old guys. 	2	2		2																					
361	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder. The weather was very hot making him very thirsty and due to the towns being abandoned, he could not stock up on water. The terrain that he had to cross had many hills and the road was not in good condition. With the heat, lack of water, ghost towns, and tough terrains, made his journey a very hard achievement to overcome. With all these obstacles in his way, he was able to achieve his goal of getting water.	2	2		2																					
364	3	First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a �shortcut� that will take him right to his destination. Then the cyclist was faced with rough rolling hills of a highway. Over his long journey the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination.	1	1		1																					
366	3	The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. The were hills that made his ride difficult. It says, �over one long cripping hill, a bulding came into view.� This shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling. Another thing in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty and becomes he to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ''by the looks of a had beth a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant.� These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
369	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he�s doing in weather that he could, �drop from heatstroke.� @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he�s seeing a mirage of a �building-abandoned years ealier.� The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in.	2	3		3																					
371	3	In the article �Do not exceed the posted speed limit,� the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways. First off the whole Setting was a dry, dusty not desert that would chair anybody. �The sun was beginning to beat down, but i borely noticed it.� The own affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much, which bring me to the next point. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and i was traveling through the high deserts of california in June. This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory. This affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push more and more to reach water. In the end the feature of the setting only made him more determined to reach water.	3	3		3																					
373	3	Many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the �high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 about that passage says blistering heat; high meaning its going to be closer to sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closet water supply was �somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,� there was a �long crippling hill� all while the sun was heating down.  All of that would most obviously effect the cyclists by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing conscionous.	2	3		3																					
374	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says �I noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� This effects the cyclist because it makes him work harded when he is dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says�� in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting flustrated an there�s No cold water. This affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost. He didn�t have a good map.	2	2		2																					
375	3	As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldn�t have trusted but did any way. This led him through the desert. Even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water op one will be there to save you from dehydration. Just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a roll in the cyclist feelings. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water. Every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact. For example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water. Finally just when his strength was to give out he found the bait place & water and that dramatically and a place to rest too bad there was another old man there, isn�t it?! 	2	3		3																					
376	3	IIn the essay the features of the cycleist affect the setting because the readers wouldnt have thought that he was in that bad of danger if he hadnt of been going through the desert. When the cyclist got to the grape factory he stated that he was almost dehydrated. And then when he got to the bait shop he drank from the faucet.	1	1		1																					
378	3	SETTING WAS A IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE STORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT THERE IS A LACK OF WATER. AND ME WAS IN A BIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS. BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR FEET TO MOVE WHICH TAKES OUT ENERGY, AND USES WATER FROM YOUR BODY.	1	1		1																					
379	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was biking up hills in extreme heat. He also had a short water supplyl while head in the wrong direction.	2	2		2																					
380	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly was incorrect and he got lost. The lack of water led to the possibility to sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst. The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy.These were the affects the setting had to the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
381	3	The feachers of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. When she biked around a bend, �my troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me.�	1	1		1																					
384	3	I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain. Some types are not always good for a bike rider because if it�s bumpy then someone could fall off the bike. Also, if it is dark you @MONTH1 not even be able to see where you are going then you could hurt your-self very seriously. That�s why riding a bike is dangerous. Also, if your in the type of enviroment where every thing is smooth then you @MONTH1 be able to have a nice bike ride.  	1	1		1																					
385	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, �Do not Exceed posted speed Limit.� By changing him physically. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, �It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting."	3	2		3																					
386	3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He can�t say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him he�ll die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and that�s like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.	2	3		3																					
387	3	The features of setting affect the author because it moves him dehydrated. The dessert sun look sweat out of him and he had no water to bring that would replace his electrolites . Also, once the author had got into the hills he had lost a lot of his energy so peddling up his was a lot of work. If I were the author I would also have gotten tired because you need water in your body to survive.	1	2		2																					
390	3	A cyclist is a bike rider. They can be in groups of diffrent people or they can be a solo cyclist. Some cyclist go for a few miles riding there bikes some can go for more like @NUM1 miles, some go over hills, go trow water they do alot with what they do. They have alot of time on there hards to ride a bike that far.	1	1		1																					
391	3	The setting is hot like desert, no one around, and very dry. Being hot outside affects the cyclist because he is sweaty and needs water. The heat wears him down. Having no one around causes him to not get water which he needs for his journey. These things make him week and makes it harder for him to find a place to get water.	1	1		1																					
393	3	"In this narritive of a cyclist, riding in california, and handed for Yosemite national park, he encounters a lack of water and bad directions from a group of old men on a pourch. The setting plays a big part in his ""challenge"", from the pine trees to the barren hills. In the begining of his trie he passes a ""gbost town"" that has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that, ""had my name written all over them."" This gives him hope and reassurance. Then the rusty pump and ""ramshackle shed."" They took the hope and reasurance away, making him cautrous. The hills that made him work hard to get over, the snake that slowed him down and the whelches juice company that was abundanded all didn't help and made matters worse. Then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better. It the setting has less the same the whole way he wouldn't have had any hope or he would have hope but it wouldn't fall and rise, making the story interenting.   "	3	3		3																					
394	3	Winding hills limited water and poor directions are the troubles of this cyclist. First he gets very bad directions from a group of old men that have not been outside of their porch in awile, then he gos through the first town and does not fill is water bottles then he gets lost and runs out of water but finds a fishing store where there is water and people that give him a better map.	2	1		2																					
395	3	"No water, and no direction effects the cyclist. Water effect cyclist because he said in the essay �I could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie). also no direction is another big one. It is important because without direction he is going to rideing for a long time. In conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story"	2	1		2																					
396	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thought he packed enough water so he began on his way he drank most of his water less than half way to his destination. He didn�t realize how hot it was until he got down to his last couple of sips of water. He started to become dehydrated he rembered the old men said that the next town was abait eighteen miles away so he kept on going when he reached the town there was nothing to drink just an old run down factory. He took same rocks and sucked on them, he went over a bump had swallowed it. He said to him self next time he would just go by what the map said everything he had gone past on the way had been run down and abandoned. Finaly he reached a bait shop and when inside the bathroom and got some water.	2	2		2																					
398	3	The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all he rides into barren land. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying �it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This was in response to the first �town� he came across. Next he speaks of a large snake that came close to him which is dangerous, but luckily he manuvers out of its way. But the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water. This is a threat to any living creature. But in the end he found some water and the story ended fine.	2	2		2																					
399	3	In the essay �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first �town� he is not too worried about it and moves on. �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.� @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked �and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.� @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didn�t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the author�s moods.	3	3		3																					
400	3	The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story the setting is a hot dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seems to start have an effect on him about after he reaches the first town. I know this by his statement.�This place might have been a thriving little spot at time �say, before the last war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chucked, checked my water supply and moved on. The the sun was beginning to beat down. The summer heat is thriving how during this @DATE1 and he is drinking lots of water.�So this setting does affect him greatly it causes him to use his water supply and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration. I know how the summer heat can affect you during @DATE1 activity �s. At times it feelslike you are going to die but that building is always around the bend just for the cyclist.  	3	2		3																					
403	3	"In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face� (@NUM1). This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� (@NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely reliefed to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever greatful. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water"	3	3		3																					
404	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The reasons were the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water were cooled down offer he refilled it all the way up. My last reason is because of the rolling hills.	1	1		1																					
405	3	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, �short, rolling hills�, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isn�t much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble.	2	2		2																					
406	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road. Lostly, seeing the old welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right infront of you but not business has to make them fell like he/she will never make it. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
407	3	The features in the setting dramaticaly affect the cyclist. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in callada he woudn�t of dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned. An ironic twist �as he calls it. And the last one is hte bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions.	1	2		2																					
412	3	The cyclist in, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, was affected greatly by the features of the setting. First of all the weather was extremely hot and hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you can�t do anything. Also no one is in sight. She is all alone making her feel small and helpless. I know that when there is no one around I get scared. Finally there is no water around. The author is obviously dieing of thirst and with nothing around her she acts even thirstier.	1	2		2																					
413	3	The setting effected the cyclist by the rough roads, the cylist having a hard time pedaling over the roads. The snake, the cyclist got scared of the snake on his ride through the �town.� The fact he was running out of water and the water he found tasted like battery acid. The setting was very rough on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
415	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by helping him get water for his thirst. And getting back on the road to go where ever he is trying to go at. But the only thing is that he didn�t never say anything about getting his bait for the fish. Also, cyclist was all so affected because he almost died from thirst and no road.	1	1		1																					
416	3	He race trying to get yosemitre for some rushing river	1	1		1																					
417	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way. Having desert rahas makes you want to just lay their and not try to go any further, because you don�t know where and end will be. As for grassy, flowery land its more of a sense rout, and makes you want to keep going and see many things. Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a chalange, and a good workout at the same time, the setting does affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
421	3	In the essay the setting affects the cyclist is different ways. For example, the couse must have been tough because he was dehydrated and it says that there are rolling hills and rough roads. Another example is there were dangerous animals like snakes that he came across. In conclusion, these are some reasons how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
424	3	The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first �town�, he could tell there�d be some issue. It was a deserted, run down area. The water was hot. Down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills. There was a big snake in the road. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water.	2	2		2																					
425	3	I think it explains because they did good job but it was not good either because they did the right thing but they did same thing worng to.	0	0		0																					
427	3	"The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the ""heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. So in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could."	2	3		3																					
428	3	Some of the things that affect the cyclist was the lack of water. �The water, bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, water is a big importance. To stort men. Your body need water to work right. The @CAPS1 humid, dry weather of California was a affect To. �The high deserts of California in June.� �l could drop from a heatstroke.� The sun is unbearable, expessary without shade and water, @CAPS2 affect on the cyclist up. The have of animals � There was No- one in sight.� It would have been a lot easier for the cyclist if store or people would have been around, @CAPS2 exact is the animals. �A @CAPS3 large   snake crossed my path.� �diamondback- blocked the majoritly of the pavement. It would have been to worry about those things these are all things that affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
429	3	Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.	2	2		2																					
430	3	In the case of thr cyclist in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,� the setting has an enormous affecton the biker. Preclaminatly, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he �had been nitting my water bottles pretty regularly. �@CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, for the demonsrtrating just how much he needed water. The wate in this pump, the owner said, was, �somewhere in the neighbar had of two hundred degrees. If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, �ghost town� infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; �there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn�t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lose and acne.	3	3		3																					
431	3	There were many different conditions that effected the cyclist. He did not have the proper ammount of water for the journey witch made it difficult. He states in the story, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1 the terrain and hills made it difficult. He ran into snakes and very deserted country. But his determination led to success and arrived into a town	2	2		2																					
432	3	"In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first �town� that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist �chuckled and moved on�, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached �the fork of sorts� twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber�s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men�s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."	3	3		3																					
433	3	Some features can affect the cyclist. The weather can slow them down like if it was cold or hot outside it can slow the person down. If the person does not	1	1		1																					
434	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you can�t see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.	1	1		1																					
437	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, the high deserts of California affected him. Also, �Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change.� For example flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then after over coming that, �A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,� �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55. Last the author says, �Sometimes life can feelso cruel. In conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
440	3	The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, ��@CAPS1 blues tune �summer time� rattled around in�my deteriorating brain.� The author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down. It�s also because there is very little water left for him. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it�s the author v.s nature. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, ��haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� The word has greatly changed. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. The towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author. 	2	2		2																					
441	3	As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclist�s attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, �with strong legs and a smile on my face�. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men�s travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn�t help but laugh. �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. �At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map.	3	3		3																					
442	3	The cyclist was riding on a rough bumby dangerous road. He had to be on the look out for animals that might try and nort or even kill him. Since he had no water he was de hydrating. Also the road was hot very well taken care of it took more energy to get through it.	1	1		1																					
443	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like hes coming or going on a vacation and because of the way hes riding it it seems hes going real fast as about to fall.	1	1		1																					
445	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by changing his mood. At the strat he had can eidance which died once he got into the barren dessert but picked up when  he round a rest stop. A prime example to how he started leds and a smile on my face �to� and the growing realization that I could dropping heartstroke on a gorgeous day in June becaused listen to some gentelmen who hadn�t been off their perch in decades � to� I had an over welming urse to seek out Gary and wilber kiss them and buy some bait. � The over all mood ox the story is based off how the authour feels.	2	3		3																					
447	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist. �I maneuvered down the hill.� This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would hawe been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy. If there werent anyhills to get in his way.	2	1		2																					
450	3	The settings in the story affected the cyclist throughout the story with winding roads and hills peddling can already be tough, tiring, and challenging, with the rider having little to know way or the roads were ten times harder to deal with. And with no landmarks or places insight its hard to have confidence because theire is nothing to keep going for.	1	2		2																					
452	3	Features in the setting of the cyclist does in fact affect him in many ways. The setting in the passage include features like, no one to be seen, no buildings, dirty, bumpsy terrain, hot weather and plenty of vegetation. All these features affect the cyclist in negative ways. For instance, the dry weather affects the human body with dehydration which the cyclist is affected by.	1	1		1																					
454	3	Each person has a really good ability that stands out. Someone can be good looking, smart or confident. Someone @MONTH1 never give up and do what he wishes to do. The cyclist in the story is or man with a strong will. He wants to be alive. He saw too many difficult in his way to get the place he wanted to be. He listened to some old guys and he lost his way. The sun was beginning to beat down. He was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal. He was losing his strength. The weather  was @NUM1�@CAPS1.The  water  tasted  like  acid battery. He  believed  himself  that he can be alive. He got stronger by believing in himself eventhough he was losing strength. Every place that he passed by was a new experienced for life. They were like a game that he came successful. He never give up. He did everything he could do to not losing his mind. He didn�t want lose the battle in his mind.   	2	3		3																					
455	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist more tired and thirsty. The rolling hills where he had to pedal up and down and the desert with no water in sight just dry land. Everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story. The old Welch�s Grape Juice Factory,is like drinks are right there but are now gone. If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he would�ve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings. The tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died. Everything in the story was the opposite of what he wanted until he got to his last hope the bait shop.	2	1		2																					
457	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, on page @NUM1, Kurmaskie said � I got down on my hands working the hande of the rusted water pump with all my strength� that shows desperation due to the lack of water.	1	1		1																					
458	3	The features of the setting been amajor affect of this cyclist  in the  story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but think is a lot like and winding. The cyclist also comes across bumps, non-paved roads that make it hard to meneuver through. Then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story.         	2	1		2																					
462	3	In the beginning the cyclist was ready to go and happy. By the time he got half way there he was �losing hope�. It was very hot and he was simple alone. By the end, he was relieved because not only did he find water, he found an easier way to get to Yosemite. The first old group of men didn�t help, but the second man did.	1	1		1																					
463	3	"In the story �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist, it say this because the cyclist enables us of what is going around him and he feels about it. It says, �one ramshack shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule greated me. The author goes on to say that it troubled him. Actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town. The unplanned that the roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55 mph since he barely had any water he was going 12 mph. This tells me, he�s troubled and confused about the surrounding ways, because it all desert seem light it became the author is slowly loosing hope on the travels further and further. I think it�s the same week people that as soon as trouble comes; or looks like it�s among they start losing hope and their better judgment, and life seems a lot harder."	3	2		3																					
467	3	In the passage �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� the setting must definetly affects the cyclist. When the cyclist comes for the first abandured �town� he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid �when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� The makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water it is just undrinkable. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist in on his last legs he must work even harder to get water a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,� this quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist most perservere. Also quote �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridicuosly large snake ��tumble weeds and snakes give the feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is what the cyclist is this point. The setting of this story directly correalates with how the cyclist is feeling.	3	3		3																					
468	3	The hot day in June riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experence has made him stronger.	2	3		3																					
469	3	FLAT ROADS, HILLS, BUILDING - ALL ARE SETTINGS THAT AFFECTED THE CYCLIST. WHILE THE HILLS WERE FLAT THE CYCLIST WAS DETERMINED HE COULD MAKE IT AND WASN�T GOING TO GIVE UP ON HIMSELF. WHEN THE HILLS GOT BIGGER AND HARDER TO PEDAI, HE BEGAN TO GET EXHAUSTED AND TIRED. LASTLY, THE BUILDINGS WERE WHAT MADE HIM WANT TO GIVE UP. WHEN HE SEES THE BUILDING OF THE WELCH�S GRAPE JUICE FACTORY AND THE YOUNG BOY DRINKING HE �HUNG HIS HEAD.� HE WAS GETTING MORE TIRED AS HE WENT ALONG. THE LAND WAS MAKING HIM FEEL AS IF HE DIDN�T WANT TO KEEP MOVING ALONG.	2	2		2																					
470	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and he was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the �ghost town� and bait shop he says, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story. 	2	2		2																					
471	3	It think  it means  to be all you can be.	0	0		0																					
472	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3. 	2	2		2																					
473	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to become dehidrated and start to lose conciousness. For ex. the town he was suposed to comue to was just an abandoned factory and he had to travlle another @NUM1 miles or so with no water.	1	1		1																					
474	3	The humid climate and hot weather will want to make you keep over if you don�t have water in your possesion. Like near the end of the essay the person sucked on stones to try retain water better which never heard about it its time. This weather is the cause of the character ??? dihydration which is a symptom of lack of water in the body.	1	1		1																					
476	3	The cyclist in the story is @CAPS1 affected by the fatause of setting in the story. The Hill afected him becaus they have harder to get over.	2	2		2																					
478	3	The setting affect the cyclist in alot of ways one way is that if you dont know where your going you could get hurt. Also is if the road condition are very bad. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
482	3	"In the @CAPS1 ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit"" many ways affect the cyclist. Three of those things are heat, lack of water, mud its anything town. The heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired. For example the text states."" I could die form a heatstroke on a gergeous day in June."" this shows that it was extremly hot. The cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty. For example it states in the text."" I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water. The last way the setting affects the cyclist is when he goes into a town and tieds it empty. The text states,"" on that morning it fit the traditional detinition at a ghost town."" This show that he expected it to be there so he could rest but it wasn't like it was appare to be things all show how the setting affected th cyclist."	2	2		2																					
484	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map. He almost died because he listened to the old men and didn�t look at his map. If the cyclist was in a car mabey he would have better luck because he would be going  faster than the @NUM1 bike.	3	3		3																					
487	3	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically. 	2	2		2																					
488	3	The cyclist in �Rough road Ahead� was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 it�s usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isn�t an easy trick.	1	2		2																					
489	3	The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says �the bulding abandoned years earlier.� If I was him I would of turned around and went back so I would take the chance of not dieing out in the middle of an abandoned area.	1	1		1																					
490	3	The setting is the main factor on effects on the cycleist. The cycleist�s main problem is that he is low on water & dehydrated, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� The author wouldn�t have been so dehydrated if it weren�t so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake & the rough road. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldn�t have been any conflicts.	2	2		2																					
494	3	In the essay �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, �cool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.�The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, �One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest Mule greet me.�there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried. The last example was, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well. As his route ends he comes across in manymore aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability.	3	3		3																					
495	3	There are many features in the setting that affect the cycleist, one of which is that he is in the middle of California riding his bike in the sun with a limited ammount of water. It affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
496	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn�t even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. �The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.� (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.	2	2		2																					
498	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions	3	2		3																					
499	3	On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their direction aren�t so good. The desserted place affected him because there was no where for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. There were rusted water pump�s, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration.	2	2		2																					
501	3	I really thought the story didn�t make sense the setting was crazy I really wasn�t feeling it at all I don�t think it was even a good story	0	0		0																					
502	3	The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective.� and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don�t have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
504	3	The trees were in the landscape and it was making the colors red and the volcanoes and the tall pine trees covered were in the landscape and milker years ago it make the swampland became the desert	1	1		1																					
506	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with �His name written over them�. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. �That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map.	3	3		3																					
507	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, �I arrived at the first �Town��this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time�but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, �short, rolling hills� (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn�t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist�s journey in a negative way.	3	3		3																					
508	3	In the story, �Rough Road Ahead�, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the setting. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert like area, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through.	2	2		2																					
509	3	In the selection �Do not exceed posted speed limit� there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn�t been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and �crippling hills,� according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn�t empty and deserted.	2	3		3																					
511	3	The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn�t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay.	2	2		2																					
513	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welch�s Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,� describes the cyclist, �but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the �shortcut.� �Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,� reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, � By the looks of it- had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory.� The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.  	3	3		3																					
514	3	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts olwing the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water decive his trip, but he was mistaken. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The setting affected the cyclist�s mood in a negative way.  	2	2		2																					
517	3	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay �A sea worry �, because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says �my son body-surfs. He says it�s his �job�. That quote was explaining that he�s a body-surfer & it�s his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph.	1	2		2																					
518	3	Condition the cyclist is in affect a lot of how they ride. One example of this is, �I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.� @CAPS1 to this fact the cyclist had went into a �dehydrated state� because of not having much water. When your travelling in hot weather areas without much water your body will become dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists diffently.	1	1		1																					
519	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead.� First, the scorching heat of the desert  in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of dehydration. In the text it states, �I could drop from heatstroke in a gorgeous day in June (@CAPS1).� This shows the effect the exposure  to heat had on @NUM1 cyclist. Also, the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story. In the text it says �I toiled on( @CAPS2).� This shows the increase in effort in strain the  terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure.	2	2		2																					
520	3	In the story �Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being hott affected him because it mad him more thirsty. Than him being out in the middle of the desert made it so he couldn�t get any water. The hills made him tired and weak. All of the features in the setting had an affect on him, which made him powerless and thirsty.	1	2		2																					
522	3	In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in.	2	1		2																					
523	3	The setting of the place was �ghost town� as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldn�t ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of new world because they told him the wrong directions.	1	1		1																					
525	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe @PERSON1 it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the problems he faced. For example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story it said �Drop from heatstroke.� this shows the setting affected him in a negative way, in the story heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character.	2	1		2																					
526	3	The features of the setting affected the author�s story a lot. It affected it by making the trip seem more difficult to the reader. This was made possible by telling how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says �over one long, crippling hill.� This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills. But if the road wasn�t as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult. This would also make it as if that the old guys gave good directions. But the whole point.	1	1		1																					
528	3	The setting affects alot in a cyclist. For example if you are in a city you seel rush tired and everweled. But in a forest you are happy and a bit less stress. A setting sets the mode also the attude in the story.	1	1		1																					
530	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist�s own words, � things began well enough.� @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, �got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.� He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him.	2	2		2																					
531	3	"The cyclist is effected by the setting in �Rough Road Ahead"" because the road is a place and if it is rough or unknown, its a direct effect on the traveler, who is the cyclist. If it is a hill then the cyclist would have to climb it. In the text it said , �over a long crippling hill,� the crippiling hill part stresses that the setting is a hill."	1	1		1																					
533	3	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclist�s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speaker�s journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
534	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can�t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can�t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn�t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink.	2	3		3																					
539	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike the roads also would make him work harder.	1	1		1																					
543	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water. The ghost town doesn�t help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abanded. This is how the features affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
548	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him. You know he was hot where it said �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.�	1	1		1																					
549	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. In the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. Also because he was in the desert he had no sense of direction. Also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn�t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water.	2	2		2																					
554	3	In the essay �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states �The sun was beginning to beat down,� @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says �@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states �dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting.	2	3		3																					
555	3	The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist. For example.� I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� The deserts of California especially in June are hot and dry and caused the cyclist to use much of his water supply, very quickly. As he �toiled� on, the terrain features became even more trying,� over one long, crippling hill��By this time the cyclist barely had enough energy to make it over a hill from all the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting.	2	2		2																					
560	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when you have hills to climb and little water, you will get dehydrated. Also the heat from the desert is so hot that it also can make you dehydrated. If you don�t  pace yourself and dont drink too much water you will be able to reach your goal. Your rest is a big thing for if you dont have energy, you will not get far.	0	0		0																					
562	3	In the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed limit� a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The rode he is rideing on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there but	2	2		2																					
564	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit� the features of the setting affects the cyclist a great deal. Each feature causing the cyclist to act. For example, in reaching the �ramshackle shed� the cyclist finds the water inusuable; which causes to conserve water and try to head for the next town. That action leads him deeper into the high deserts of California during June. Also as the terrain changes from flat road to short, rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every �shack or building he comes across for water. In this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot.	2	2		2																					
565	3	The cyclist in the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� is about a great adventure gone bad. He has every thing he needs but some how it turns out bad. He get low on water & the setting is horrible. He is on his way from a camp ground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite river. He gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns & was running out of water then he came to a sign that said, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� He was pedeling over hills & becoming dehydrated when he tought he was going to die he came to a bait shop & got waiter & met an old guy who was going to give him direction & he decided he better stick to the map. Even though the setting got worse through the story & stuck it out & made it to the end.	3	2		3																					
567	3	The cyclist is in the desert which @NUM1 degrees with water that tastes like the battery acid. The desert makes him see the mirages having sweat get into his eyes. In the story  �Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie 	1	1		1																					
569	3	He�s on a very hot climate, in a desert, so he needs lots of water, but he has a limited supply. He�s riding on hills, which makes it even harder. He can�t find any towns that aren�t abandoned.	2	2		2																					
571	3	There were several features of the setting that held an affect on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert. This condition normally prevents one from obtaining water. Seeing as how water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack there at due to the desert created the conflict of dehydration. Additionally, the town that was abandoned triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclist�s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope. By the time he/she reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now his head is screaming with annoyance and his body is screaming with lack of water. This abandoned juice factory almost completely wiped out the cyclist hope. A man is little to nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative affect on him. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her desperation of survival, an instinct in all of us. In conclusion, the desert removed water and the abandoned homes and factory removed hope and all three created a negative affect. The cyclist is lucky to have survived. 	1	1		1																					
572	3	The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn�t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.	1	1		1																					
573	3	In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows features of the setting played that affects the cyclist in many different ways. A setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking (drinking) water, and worrying that he is going to run out. Kurmaskie writes, � I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in @NUM1). This is what the cyclist gets affected by throuout the whole story as he releizes he could die of heatstroke if he dosent watch how much water hes drinking. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration.	2	2		2																					
574	3	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place things change No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist. Never travel advice home old-timers who haven�th confines of use porches.Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit.	1	1		1																					
577	3	A response that explains how the features of setting affect the cyclist by getting wrong dirachion The old man. One features when tough an ghost town. The old people in the didn�t know they were tell him. It made it haede for nam because that more harder roads and lesort water. He almost died.	1	1		1																					
579	3	Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking to much of his water. So when he stoped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water their. He started his ride the the roads were hilly and short. Then the road turned into bumpy to. So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way. 	1	1		1																					
580	3	The character in this short story has a most that changes with his surroundings. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said �� The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,�� As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher.	1	1		1																					
581	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance the desert is not a hummid making is lack of water a bigger deal than normal. Also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal. In conclusion I temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.	2	2		2																					
582	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by never accept travel advice from colletion of old timer who haven�t left there porches since carter was in office. After that because you don�t know if they are real collection or what. After because some people have not left there porches since carter was in office. I don�t know why people have not left there porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
583	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot, him not having anything to drink, nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages. In the essay it states, �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.� This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding enviroment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasen�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. �The cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one.	2	2		2																					
584	3	In �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie: c, I think that e the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and he thought he was going to die In this case he had no water left and he was in the desert. He was regreating not taking the advice of the stranger and was dieing of thirst. Also he dident have the mind set that he wanted to live. Thats how I think the setting affectd him.    	1	1		1																					
585	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the �high desserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. �I could drop from a heatstroke,� he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist�s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. �Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact.	3	3		3																					
587	3	Some of the feature setting that effect the cyclist was the seal was begging to lent down, but he truly noticed it and about twenty miles up the road he came to park of sorts. The cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June. He get on his hands and hence working on the heated handle of the rusty pump. The pump began it shoot out a tarlike substance and the water was feeling somewhere of two hundred degrees. Two more miles I noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to a short, rolling hills.� He said tumble weeds crossed her path and a large snake crossed her pavement. He gather some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, after reading that if sucking of stones helps to be your mind off thirst. Well after reading of I believed these settings did effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
588	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the �town� The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, ��I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, �Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp�� (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   	3	2		3																					
590	3	The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn�t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff	1	1		1																					
591	3	In the cyclist�s outlook on his journey through Yosemite�s park, reader�s can get a good feel of how it might be to be riding right along side. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride. He sees such a vast variety of scenery including rivers, sandy dry deserts also, as well as cool pines and trees in the park part. He said it was also breezy which probably made for an enjoyable temperature.	1	1		1																					
593	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. �I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.� All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.	2	2		2																					
594	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off. It caused him to go dehiderated because lack of water and he went kind of dilerious. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was un drinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree. Lastly, the Welch�s factory that he came across was teasing him in in the way that he couldn�t have the liquids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch�s juice. Not only did the cyclist get off track because the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable.	3	2		3																					
597	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren�t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat.	2	2		2																					
600	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self- determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths inorder to reach their destination.For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are based to reach some rough spots where it seems you can�t walk. But that is where self�determination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there @MONTH1 be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip, when you don�t have the right provision to keep you self energised you can �t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything.This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
601	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie). This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldn�t have taken the old mens advise. He explains that �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself.	2	2		2																					
602	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist is tired and thirsty already. The features include a desert like setting of California, it is extremely hot, there are no signs of civilization in sight, and the roads are like hills that always were throughout the desert. On top of those facts the cyclist is dehydrating because his water suposely has diminished. 	1	1		1																					
603	3	"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
605	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into �short, rolling hills,� These hills are increasing the difficulty and are causing him doubt that he will make it. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The horizon was what kept cyclist going. �I began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine.� The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it.	3	2		3																					
606	3	I guess really sofcty comes first, and you have to be cautious when yay out in the streets on a bicycle. I really don�t understand much, so I can�t write much.	0	0		0																					
611	3	The feature of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. He was a California desert in the month of June. There was no water in the desert so he had to use the water he had. He says the sun began taking harder ran and the terrain turned into short rolling hills. The hills made him work harder which dehydrate him guccher.and since there was no water in the desert, he could have died of dehydration	2	2		2																					
612	3	When your with your family in ocean city biking down the board walk your only obstacle is people. When your in a race on whinedy roads you could have lots of obstacles. The wheather could be your greatest obstacle. You could pass out by lack of water and scorcing heat. You could fall over by slippery roads from the rain. Along with that nature could lay its toll apon you. �a ridiculously large snake�blocked the majority of the pavement in front of @NUM1, Kurmaskie) @CAPS1 like a snake you don�t know what you could come across.	1	1		1																					
617	3	In the story the features of setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn`t going to make it. When he finally got to �Gary & Wilber�s fish camp,� he learned a lesson because when an old man asked if he know the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map.''	2	2		2																					
620	3	First, by accepting the old mens� advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would, easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a �ghost town�, lifeless and most importantly, waterless. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like �battery acid�. Next he rides past a �Rough Road Ahead� sign; not the most encouraging thing on his journey. To add to the despair, he has to manever his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp. �To him, this simple bait shop was like  beacon of hope from food himself.	2	3		3																					
621	3	In this story, the cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite, California. In the begining, the cyclist was sure of himself he decided to ask some old men that looked like they haven't been off their porch since Carter was in office for directions. The old men ended up leading him into the middle of the desert. In the desert, the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water. There was no sign of civilization what so ever. These hot conditions made the cyclist very hot, tired, and very thirsty. But that didn't stop him, he kept going and eventually he came apon a little town where he could drink cool water and take a well needed rest. 	2	3		3																					
622	3	Through most the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way. For instance, he makes it to this town a guy swore was there, but it turned out to be abandoned. So he let out a sad, hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, so he hung his head and that blues tune �summer time� rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst. So he stuck some pepples in his mouth to take his mind off it. Then he thought about how lucky he�d be if he checked, @CAPS1 negative to me.	2	2		2																					
623	3	The features from the essay affect the cyclist in many was because he is getting field, and is drinking more and more water. The raods are getting rough so he needs to slow down. If he slows down he will get tierd and need more water although he is all out on top of that the old men really didnt know what they were talking about the features affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
625	3	The setting in the begining of the story is flat an easy but as the path becomes unfamiliar it turns into many hills & turns. This effects the cyclist a lot because he was low on water & was begining to become dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
628	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the author goes through many seneries. All of the places that the author goes to make him even more determined because he wants to find water and he just wants to get to Yosemite. The determination pushes him to keep going further and further. And then the determination finally pays off after he goes around a turn because he then see�s a place where he can get something to drink and a place to cool down.	2	1		2																					
629	3	The features of this setting effect the author while he is cycling. They changed his hope to doubt. There were no buildings or cars, which led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water. Im sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just civilization, then the cyclist would of been fine.	1	2		2																					
630	3	Blazing tempitures, lack of water, dwinding hope-all are the parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. Blazing tempitures, because the hotter the water was the more perspiration and lack of hydration was appointment you can�t put anything back in your skin and your body can�t function without water finally dwinding . Hope, the cyclist didn�t think he was going to live through this. He tried hard and pushed himself and success was made. He lived.	2	2		2																					
633	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. The features of the setting affect the cyclist through the posted speed. Due to how the setting is the cyclist have a rough hill with wish.	1	1		1																					
634	3	The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water. There are obsticles in the road too, such as, the big snake laying across the middle of the road. He is lost without water and could possibly die of an heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
635	3	Knew what he was getting himself into so if he needed water or nething like that, it was probly his own falt he should have brought some with him.	1	1		1																					
638	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The temperature in the area affect the way he drinks his water which leads him to thinking he is going to die because he is running out of water. The �towns� he comes to are so deserted he thinks he is going in the wrong direction. All the settings in the story also help him not to give up but keep on going. In conclusion even though he had to go through all that doubt he was going to be alive in the end he still went on and tried. In the end he did make it and all it was worth it.	2	2		2																					
639	3	There are many setting that affect the cyclist. One feature would be the terrain around him. Also, the obstacles faced by the cyclist. Another feature would be the types of wild animals & scarceness of water around . Also, the old man who gave him unimportant & non-updated information. All of these would affect the cyclist because it would  wear & fear on his physical & mental strengths.	2	1		2																					
640	3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclists state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it is summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early @DATE1. And third he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together. He was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These @NUM1 things all contributed to the characters state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, that tasted like battery acid. He drank to much water at the begining which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough.	3	2		3																					
644	3	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again.	2	2		2																					
645	3	"The features of the setting make him happy because he meets some people that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip. This is what the text says, �what I shouldn�t have done was let them have a peck at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a �shortcut� that was to slice away hours from my ride."" He also talks about not talking directions from old timers. This is when the text says,�"	1	1		1																					
646	3	During the cyclist journey to Yosemite many things got in his way and slowed him down. For example, he listened to the old men who gave him wrong directions to where he wanted to go. Also, his water supply was getting low which drained his energy alot quicker than usual. The heat also played a part of his energy loss. The heat made him sweat perfusely which made the water that was in his body be of no use.    	2	1		2																					
649	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. The landscape was hard to ride on, there was intense heat & little water. As a result, it was a long trip and he had a difficult time reaching his destination.	1	1		1																					
652	3	Setting that affected the cyclist was water tempeter, rolling hills and condition of the roads. Water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started pumping the water it was hot but he took it he tried to let it cool down but it didn�t. Rolling hills was another a tender to the cyclist hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up his can strain the leg and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition, it was smooth at frist then it became rough and rocky. Those was some affects the cyclist had to over come	2	2		2																					
654	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.   "	3	3		3																					
655	3	Well the features of the setting affects the cyclist is a lot of ways. Well when his water was is hot to drink He got some pebbles and stuck them, in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that it will dilute your spit. The terrain of the story was very rocky and hilly. Those are the features of the terrain.	1	1		1																					
656	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The hills afected the cyclist because they would be harder for him to ride The abandoned town also affected him. When he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break but when he got there the town was abandoned. Also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on. Also there was nowhere that he could get water around him. Many features of the setting affected him.	2	2		2																					
657	3	The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist�s anger. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, �one ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule.� All of sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to becom frightened and neurotic. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, �the water wouldn�t cool down� and �it had the flavor of battery acid. The cyclist�s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought �had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory.� The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting.  	3	2		3																					
664	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, �Sometimes life can be so cruel�. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He�s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
666	3	The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. It is an extremely hot now in California while the narrator in aiding his ride. This causes him to become delighted much faster while he is on a �Short hit� leading to no where. �Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from ?? a gorgeous day in June� This gust shows how that calm day really was and the fact the cyclist is sweating so much shows how much the weather is affecting him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling towards up and down no often, it secured his journey. It cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water.The deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply.	2	3		3																					
667	3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal. Before you bike thinkof what conditions are ahead of you	3	2		3																					
671	3	This essay is an american tale that express how hard it is to do someing. But do it thought determination. The cycle are faced with many change not onnly physically but also menataly. There was no one in sight not a building  or anything. As this rider come to think that the sabstatal beating he took from the ride he is tirde and no sight of baidi say he might not be able to do it.	1	1		1																					
673	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. At first it was a bright shiny day and the cyclist was happy. He reaches the first town which is a ghost town and it makes him sad. Riding on he begins to lose water. The once bright shiny day began to beat the heat down on the cyclist. He reached a ramshackle shed and began to lose hope. He loses water quickly and becomes more dehydrated. The terrain become slopes and hills and the ride become harder, when he reached the grape drink factory his hopes were almost gone. But just over the hill was a fishing shop. He used his reining energy to speed down the hill to get water and get his energy back. 	1	1		1																					
674	3	"The features of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when it says, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.� The features of this setting are making the cyclist determined. Another example, is when it says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" The features of the setting are making him brave and couragious. The last example is when it says, �I hung my head.� The features of this setting are making the cyclist have despair. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
675	3	In the essay �Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,� the cyclist is affect both positivly and negativly by the setting. Setting is the sounding in which the story tacks place. In the story a cyclist loses his way and band is put in to dangous because of it. The setting of the story can be dicrided as mountainous with many rolling hills. The author discride the setting by say �@CAPS1 two miles in to the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.� The change in terrain made it more difical for the cyclist. However he also used the land to give him hope that he was almost their. He told him self that he�d make it if he make it over the next hill. The setting of the story gave the cyclist hope and problems in his journy to sarive.	1	1		1																					
676	3	The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men who�s information was not accurate. Then he cycled along the desert which was very hot. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way. He almost had a heat stroke a few times. He was probably angry that he took these men�s advice and got himself into this. Then when he found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So it�s really confusing because he probably felt relived and mad at the same time. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn�t, the old man would have gave him some more messed up direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke.	3	2		3																					
682	3	In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,�The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.� In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I�d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.� This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn�t care if he died. From the author�s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
683	3	Features of the setting such as the hot sun, no water, and �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp,� greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high desserts of California in June, the temperature was really high and the hot sun left �wide rings of dried sweat� on his shirt and made the cyclist realize that he could drop from a heatstroke. Also, the fact that the only water around felt �somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees� and �had the flavor of battery acid� prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a �dehydrated state.� @CAPS1, �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp� affected the cyclist by solving his problem of dehydration, since there was cold water availible for him upon arrival.	2	2		2																					
686	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways. He was biking in the middle of the summer in a very hot state of California. This affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated. The roads are very hilly so, he has to use alot more energy to get up the hills. That�s why I think the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed.�   	2	1		2																					
689	3	The cyclist had alot of problems with his setting. It was very hot and he started getting low on water. This caused him to become dehydrated. There was hardly any civilization so no one could come to his aid. Also, the path he decided to take was long and vigorous.	1	1		1																					
694	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. If the setting is dark trainy, there aren�t going to be ??? running outside. If it is snowing, the ??? are not going to be swimming in the water.	0	0		0																					
695	3	That explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclsit. Is because some people don�t care about there features. Every body are working for a good feature but, others they @CAPS1 still from people who work. Everyday to have a new features.	0	0		0																					
696	3	"In �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist by making him doubtfull. The cyclist is doubtfull that he won�t make it to Yosemite National Park. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.� This shows how he is doubtful. Finally in the story the cyclist doesn�t think that they will make it."	2	2		2																					
697	3	In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, �This sight was troubling,� he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, �It didn�t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die.	2	2		2																					
699	3	The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? � It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�� The heat must have been bad, he wasn�t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men �helping� with directions.	2	2		2																					
700	3	As he began his journey, he had full confidence in the directions given given to him by the old men. After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on. After he found an �ramshackle shed� he became troubled , as he �had been �hitting� his �water bottles regularly� and was traveling through the �desert of California in June� and was running low on water. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he �manuevered� his way down, only to find it long  deserted and himself close to despair. He was desparate for water he needed it soon. Finally, he came upon �@CAPS1 and Wilber�s Fish Camp� and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on  he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling.	2	2		2																					
701	3	The features of the setting in the story �DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn�t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting�s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story.	2	3		3																					
702	3	The cyclit of �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was �@NUM1 degers�. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would�ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story.	2	2		2																					
704	3	Dry, thirsty, tedious-all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, everything is dry. The cyclist isnt any where near a town that could help him. He has been pedaling in the heat, outside for a long time. Secondly, He is very thirsty. The way he is travelling is a good sign he is in need of water. He went fourty miles before he reached the first town to stop at. He also is on a bike, So that doesn�t leave him much room to carry water along. Lastly, the trip is tedious. He has been going for forty miles, and the speed limit is 55. He hasn�t acceded 12 mph. All to gether, the cyclists trip seems to be adventure that takes a lot of heart.	1	1		1																					
706	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was very hot and he didn�t have any more water also, there aren�t any towns that had good water in them, until he eventually arrived at this fishing comp. Due to his lack of water, he became dehydrated and really weak. �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� this quote shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and losing his energy.	1	2		2																					
707	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.	2	3		3																					
709	3	From the setting that affected the cyclist are possible conditions such as the weather and surrounding enviorment like hills and streams or even tyes of animals and if they are poisenous or not. The setting has and can change the desision a cyclist makes.	1	1		1																					
711	3	Many features of the carlifonian desert influenced the cyclist during his ride.Ghost towns, rolling hills, and dangerous snakes influenced the cyclists experience during the''shortcut'' to yosenite.The Ghost towns along the journey syndized the world desrting him during his ride by offering no help with water supply as a place to cool dowdn.The road sign warning of rough terrain was another barrier on his bike ride that he had to get through in dehydration to reach his goal,yosenite.The diamondback rattlesnate caused additional horror to the cyclist's'' ride from hell''.He had to manuever around the serpent while unstable from dehydration.All features of the cyclist's riding setting affected his ride to yosenite.	3	2		3																					
713	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can�t go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he�s relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn�t really know where he was going because there wasn�t a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first �town� as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and he�s only 12 he knows that he�s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
715	3	The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he�s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he�s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that there�s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved.	3	3		3																					
716	3	The setting affected the cyclist by the people from Lodi get him into the wrong way and he had to survive from there so he that was very dry and No water or nothing to the next stop was at the bait store so he was determined to get to next stop destination by he did want to give up own but the guy ask him did he want direction he said he was not going to be fooled twice.	1	1		1																					
718	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left. The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town. The setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much.	2	2		2																					
719	3	Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate. And the long flat roads are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go but as straight roads turn into hills it shows that there is a change in the journey and something better is about to happen.	2	2		2																					
721	3	The cyclist is affected by @NUM1 couple different things. First, he is given directions that are out of date and then he has to deal with the heat of the weather in the early summer of California. If that wasn�t enough, he then runs out of water, which he needs very badly. He runs into a couple more problems, like seeing a big snake and coming to a factory that used to make juice and it was now run down and empty. After all of these obsticles, the cyclist pulls through and makes it to @NUM1 fishing store, where he gets water.	2	2		2																					
722	3	During the cyclist�s biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town This sight doesn�t immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain. Eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief. As evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence.	3	2		3																					
726	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, �I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
727	3	The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront  nature. when he began his trip with advice from �old coggers� he � rode out with strong legs and a smile.� As he came to the first town, he describes it as a �ghost town� having no water and no human contact for some time. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rods on. Through the miles he incountered a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps, snakes,and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his �inner spirit� and caused his dehydration to further. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation.	2	2		2																					
728	3	The harsh features at the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along �The high deserts of California in June�, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small �gost towns� rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as �Short rolling hills� through ghost the terrain and ever a snake. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey etc.	2	3		3																					
729	3	Cycling is a very good sport people who do cycling are in shape. Also they have strong calve muscles. I think its also dangerous as well.	1	1		1																					
731	3	The cyclist thought it was hard. Also he was upset that the old timers gave bad directions.	2	2		2																					
735	3	The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as �the sun was beating down� and �high deserts of California in June� to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says �short rolling hills�, �tumbleweeds� and �long, crippling hill� to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower.  Finally, the cyclist is faced with a �rediculously large snake� and plants and weeds which get in his way and force him to slow down.	2	2		2																					
736	3	The setting effects the cyclist very much. By the very dry climates	2	2		2																					
737	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead� plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn�t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see�s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn�t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. �Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.� @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her."	3	3		3																					
743	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The man was riding a bike through rough lands. His adventure wouldn�t of been an adventure if he was just riding his bike an flat smooth element. The fact that the hills were steep, rocky and many hills is what made his bike ride what it was.	1	1		1																					
745	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist by showing the rough conditions he went through, and somehow perservered through. The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the rolling hills. Followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This shows the struggle he went through and supports the setting story and how it affected his trip. This also shows how he perserverd through his struggles and made an effort to finish.	1	1		1																					
749	3	"The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and their is no where to go. An example from the test is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. Thats what affected the cyclist the heart the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most all no directions."	2	1		2																					
753	3	The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story �do not exceed posted speed limit� It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California all worn down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated. It says in the essay �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a georgus day in June simply because I listend to some gentlemen.� this explains on how simply exhausted he had become due to the miles of cycling, and the beating down sun and total lack of water due to absence of all towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhausgen because of the faulty directions of the old people. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions.	2	2		2																					
754	3	"As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that be lovers, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confidentin the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted.Though at first he laughs it off, he laster realizes just how much trouble he in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates. All there features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point.      "	3	3		3																					
756	3	When riding a bike it @MONTH1 not seem to hard. For a cyclist every thing becomes more serious. The determination to win and be the best even if it kills you. In this essay he under estimates the dder cyclist. When really they are the people with more knowledge. Some of the things that @MONTH1 be hard for cyclist are the rough roads. Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke. As road get worse chances get higher tumble weeds and snakes in the way, he was determined to win. After all was said and he faced the horror that nature brought him he knew he was wrong wrong for them and the intelligants.	2	3		3																					
758	3	Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride.	1	1		1																					
760	3	"The setting will either effect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way. In the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie it affects the cyclist in a bad way and a good way. In the story, it continues to talk about lack of water. �When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery @NUM1). This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down. But a good way it affect them is pebbles. ""I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to @NUM2). This shows that even though he has no water the pebbles can make him less thirsty. This is how the setting affects the cyclist. In good way and a bad way."	1	1		1																					
767	3	The feature of the setting is making the cyclist frustrated, thirsty, and confused. The features are making him frustrated by he thought he was going the right way where he really was going out.	1	1		1																					
769	3	Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he�s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old �codgers�  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.� Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        	3	2		3																					
770	3	I am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him. The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot & drinking his water & he would soon run out of water & dehydrate. For example in the story the cyclist would always bring up the little bit of water he had left & around the essay he talked about the dehydration he was seeing & even death. Another example is the relif he had when he drink the water from the sink. In conclusion, this is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
771	3	This paragraph tells about how careful you should be on the roads.This also talks about what you have to be aware of.There so many things that could happen.You have to take control when your on the road.	1	1		1																					
772	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states �This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town.� This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
776	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die � �(Kurmaskie).	3	2		3																					
778	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that said �Rough Road Ahead� he was already low on water, but that made things much worse. The rough road made it harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working harder and getting thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some pebbles on the ground and shoved them in his mouth. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate�. Lastly, �GARY AND WILBER�S FISH CAMP�, could possibly have saved the cyclist�s life. He stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear. The setting and features severly affected the cyclist throughout his journey.  	2	2		2																					
779	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of he setting affect how the author feels. In the beginning of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is, �a reservoir camp ground outside at Lodi, California� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, �This sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, �Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me� (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The area the author goes through has an effect"	2	3		3																					
783	3	In the short story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� by @PERSON1, a cyclist travels through an extreme climate and tough terrain that nearly end his life to get to his destination. After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first �town� the locals said he�d find is deserted. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has �the flavor of battery acid.� With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June�, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� @CAPS1 tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a �water-depleting @NUM3.� eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, knowing now to strike out on better days and better directions.	2	3		3																					
786	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist�s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he @MONTH1 not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let  down for the cyclist�s mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned.	2	3		3																					
789	3	Well first off its very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily. And the hills are hard to get up so it would be a challange to get to the top. All I know is the lack of water can kill you if you get heatstroaks easily.	1	1		1																					
791	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhausting. The heat @MONTH1 cause the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal. This is especially true in this case because of his lack of water. The cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke. The terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road. His muscle will start to ocha and his body will need water and rest. The story would totaly change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the @DATE1 on a cold day in the mid @NUM1 he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke. There would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything.	2	2		2																					
793	3	Desert, Hills and road condition and lack of water �all are how the setting affected the cyclist. First, the cyclist reveals he is in the desert when he exclaims, �I was trave ling throug the high deserts of california in June.� This means it was hot. Second the hills and road condition�s were horrible. The cyclist reveals this when he describes, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,� aid againg  It read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly, He had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from. So he drank all the rate he wanted. He then figured out the needed to conserve it but by then it was too late. The examples shows that the cyclists condition was harder than he expected them to be.	1	1		1																					
794	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
797	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in �ghost towns�, there is no-one to ask directions from or to just talk to. Also, some pumped water from water pumps tastes like �battery acid� and could most likely make some one sick. Also, there are poisonous snakes and other dangerous animals.	1	1		1																					
798	3	"There are many features in the story, ""that affect the roles, like out of waters, bad directions. The narrator is ??? and says, ""the water bottles container a few tantalizing sips..� it is say that there is hardly any water left , and he still have to keep going on, until he can find some In the story water is something he has to over come because he is out of it by the time he gets to the fish store."	1	1		1																					
802	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting the cyclsit is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. �But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because has eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. �After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read:ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challamging for the cyclsit. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, he�s relieved.	2	2		2																					
803	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the features is just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it. The cyclist gives you what you want and need to know so the affect would be about time the feature is finish play in noone would want to see the cyclist.	0	0		0																					
804	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting of a story is the background, place, and time the story took place. In the story, a cyclist needs to get to @CAPS1 Park. He stops and gets direction from a group of old men, who aren�t up with the times, and the cyclist gets lost. He faces drought, a snake, and being lost in the desert, the cyclist says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like a diamond back � blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, to"	1	2		2																					
805	3	The cyclist choose the worst time to ride his it was an �early summer evening� in California. At this time the sun is hot and with little water and also lost, it was hot the best choice that he made. A cyclist before do a trip he or she should be prepared for whether conditions and also check a map of the place before going anywhere. 	1	1		1																					
807	3	The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the �ghost town� early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned welch�s Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, �It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� @CAPS1, his suffering was through when he discovered a �fish camp,� with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist�s relief was so immense that he,� had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them.	1	1		1																					
808	3	The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe.	2	1		2																					
809	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he first didn�t know where he was going and took directions from people that he wasn�t really sure about. It was hot he was running out of water he had no idea where he was there were snakes. His water was running out. there were no sings he kept thinking that he would never take directions from an old guys and that he would stick to the future.	1	1		1																					
811	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting seemed to affect the main character (the cyclist) very much during his pedal, for example, whole the dry desert setting made him think that he could survive with out water, he became dehydrated. The first town, with @NUM1 degree watter could not satisfy his standards. The old velches June factory, was all run down, and is no longer in business, much like the desert, just old barren unuseland. While yes the cycalist survived the pedal, the desert setting opposed a great challenge for him. 	2	2		2																					
815	3	The setting effected the cyclist because it was bumpy and had a lot of hills which means he has to work harder. Also because of the heat he was getting dehydrated in the story after the cyclist had Been rideing a long time it says �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state �(kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist had very little water for his long trip	2	3		3																					
816	3	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist I think is disgardment. First of all, a reason would be because at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist disgards it by going down the hill anyways. Also, it states that it �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.�	1	1		1																					
817	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he went through many ups and downs. At one point flowed by blackish watter feeling somewhere in the neighbor of two hundred degrees.. weather wouldn�t cool down.	1	1		1																					
819	3	The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more, which makes one�s body use more energy. The sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels. Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclist�s will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. The features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going	3	2		3																					
821	3	"The setting acts as a catylist in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is always challenging the character untill the very end. In the story it says �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says �The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.� This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him it also shows how is risle he is, and how satiricle life can be. The ultimate @CAPS1 in this story is when he stumbels across the welches grape juice factory and there was a piture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.� No matter where the cycalist goes he is alway trying to overcome the elements."	2	3		3																					
822	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water begins to take a toll of how fast he can get to the next town. Another example would be the terrain only slows him down more.	1	1		1																					
823	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because it�s hot, and than theres no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� (@NUM1.). This exert from the test supports my previous statement about how it�s hot because the speaker tells us how he�s sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage. �There was no one insight not a building, car, or any structure of any kind� (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance.	2	2		2																					
826	3	The features of a setting could be a number of different things. It could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, breezy and humid. The features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. The setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. In the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. These have been what I believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist.	2	3		3																					
827	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when the author says �flat roads were replace by short rolling hills�, that made the author have to ride safer. Also, when he says,� the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.� The author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past. Finally when the author says �no one in sight�, no building, car, or structure�, he is affected because he can�t ask questions since hes lost and hes thirsty. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go.	1	2		2																					
829	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined.	1	1		1																					
830	3	In the story, the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1�s Fish camp, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclist�s attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not.	3	3		3																					
831	3	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappoint, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally when he passes a portrin the road with nothing but a �ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral�� he becomes disturbed.  The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, �doing a water-deleting @NUM1.� The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, �ironic twist� the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist.	3	2		3																					
833	3	The raugher the road gets for him the more determination he has at the beginning towards the end he had the mind set that, �it didn�t matter it was going to die, �this took a toll on him and it was hard to go on. He realyed he didn�t want to die that way and so he kept on, eventually leading to civilisation.   	1	1		1																					
834	3	The feature of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described which implies that the biker probably had a hard time half way through the story he said, �Flat road was replaced by shor, rolling hills.� He said this to describe the difficulty in this race. It also makes it seem exciting because it changes things around. It wouldn�t be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didn�t show the terrain change at all.	1	1		1																					
836	3	The settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood. Take for instance the cycler. In the beginning he had a positive attitude but once he arrived at the first town his attitude started to go down from there. He explains describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot, �but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� Ghost towns come across very old, run down and dull. That affected the cyclist because by it not being like the old men said he was becoming doubtful, which in turn doesn�t give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when he get to what is suppose to be water and a, �tar like substance oozed out.� That makes him nevers and mad because he isn�t sure he will make it. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store. The setting becomes positive and so does he. So, the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude.	2	2		2																					
838	3	The effects from the setting that has an effected on me is that while riding on the bike in hot weather with only a little bit of water to drink because I would have giving up have nothing to drink. The water had to be hot.In the text it sayed �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�, I don�t think I could have lasted long, if I was dehydrated. From the look of it I would have drop dead of heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
841	3	The cyclist of this story is greatly affected by the heat of his souroundings. While he riding to @CAPS1, the heat of the day began to increase. The text reads � I had been hitting my water bootle regulary. �@CAPS2 to the heat of the day, the cyclist was down to his water consuming large patterns of it at a time. He 	1	1		1																					
842	3	When the cycleist mentions how hot and dry and open the terrain is, it makes me feel like he is in the desert. I also know that it�s hot because he is swreating and dehydrated.	1	1		1																					
843	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he�s fine. �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them� (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn�t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, �It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� he knows that things are going to get rough, because �the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph�. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn�t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, �tumble weeds crossed my path.� The landscape seems to get more threatening too, �a ridiculously large shake.� The landscape changes with the state of water."	3	3		3																					
845	3	the features of setting that the cyclist run into does affect him. For example when the setting changes from abandoned town to an empty deserted rond that no been on in thirty years; gives a cyclist less motivation him self to go on and even less strength.	1	1		1																					
846	3	Joe Kurmaskie�s �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who don�t tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. @PERSON2, �The sun was beginning to beat down� I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer.	3	1		3																					
848	3	Do not Exceed posted speed limit, never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confinses of their porches sin Carter was in the office twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork as sorrs. I got down on my hands and kness, working the handle of the rasted water pump with all my strength. The water bottles contained only a few totalt and sips. He could or been sad person. And he could just be a bum.	2	1		2																					
849	3	The features of the setting could affect this cyclist. In this case it do effect the cyclist. According to the text �Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� This is a good example because he knew that this road was going to be rough and he was only going 12 mph. So the features of the setting did effect the cyclist. 	1	1		1																					
854	3	Features from the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in he was in had a major affect. He was in cali. which is a big dessert. In the middle of some it is very hot. Bike riding on roads in the dessert with no trees or shade of any sort is quet harsh. And to be riding around where there is not much civilazation as to where you can�t get water is a major issue.	1	1		1																					
855	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there is poisonous snake out thre. Your the only person ridin dow those hills all by your self. The guy had said that the next town was @NUM1 miles from where he was at. The lack of water that there were not any streams or rivers around there just in a desert with nothing.	1	1		1																					
857	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, your in the desert cycling for many hours very hot and only have limited water. This affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park. Anothe example, is that you are going up and down rolling hills and you legs get very tired so they don�t want to move any more. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you and your sweating so much and @MONTH1 be seeing thing but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
860	3	The setting that affect the cyclist is the condition of the road because the road turns all different ways and the road goes up hill so it makes it harder to go up the road the cyclist has @NUM1 miles befor he gets to a town he could run out of water. If he run out of water befor he gets there, he might have to make stops so he doesn�t make hisself sick. When he gets to the town he can get more water.	1	1		1																					
861	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him hot and thristy most of his way. As he rode he started to get tired slowly and he got work and more thirsty. He drank his water at first with out thinking to much or it, but as he went on he slowly found himselfs trying to conseve it. By the time he got to the second wild town the will he was so thirsty and tired thathe thought it might of been a ""death"" So he wiped the sweat from his eyes."" to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when the are hot,tired, and about to kill for some water. This is what the cyclist was like after his long jouney to Yosemite National Park with the directions given by old men."	2	1		2																					
863	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. The speed limit sign makes him feel like life is cruel. His first glimpse of the welch's Juice factory makes him feel excited. Meeting the deserted fork in the road makes him feel troubled. When he finally gets there, he feels relieved. These are all examples showing that features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
864	3	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist & his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,�and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place. Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert. that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced.	1	1		1																					
865	3	The features setting in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn�t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and how much he could ride.	1	1		1																					
866	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. In the story, it taliks about how the man is pedling twenty miles here and fourty miles there and it's very hot outside and he only has so much water abd he doesn't think he'll make it to where he was to go because its do not that he need more water. As the narrator sas"" I was travelling throuhg the high deserts of california in June"" which is extremely not in california in June. The deserts hot weather made him eimited on water supply, and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere, no buildings around makes him lose all hope for making it through. There were snakes in the desert which endagered him, and the bumpy road made it harder for him to hold on and get to somewhere. "" I began breaking the ride into distance i could see on te horizon, telling mself if i could make it treat i'd be fine."" This quote shows his struggle because of the area he was in but also his persitance. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this essay."	3	2		3																					
867	3	Many features of the cyclist�s surroundings effect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor cycles, or even buildings. It�s like he�s on the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won�t hit any thing. The fact that he�s alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident.	1	1		1																					
872	3	The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one. He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long  in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the author�s terrain. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I don�t have to bike in that terrain.  	2	1		2																					
876	3	The features of the setting put an affect on the cyclist. The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds, and a ridiculously large snake. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play.	2	2		2																					
878	3	The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be �There was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is �wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who haden�t been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly.	2	2		2																					
879	3	During the authors ride to Yosemite, he doesn�t have the proper tools to go along the long stretch of desert he was to face, and by tools I mean water. The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. He described this with sentences like �Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.� The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water. The author was getting neat stroke being passed by @LOCATION2  desert snakes and tumbleweeds. The author was clearly in a struggle against the @LOCATION2 desert heat.	2	3		3																					
881	3	"The features of setting effected the cyclist because he was in a desert in the month of June which was really hot and dry, there were also no trees around so there was no shade for him to relax in so the sun was also beating on his back. There was also lots of hills that took his strength to jump for example it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" There was also a big crazy twist in his way. He even saw a snake. All of these things made him really tired for example he didn't have much water and the sun was making him hot and dehydrated. There was no shade so he had to just take the sun beating down on his back. He had to jump over hills so that took alot of energy. He had to ride up one long hill so that also made him tired. All of these things happened back to back without giving him a break, so it really tired him out."	2	2		2																					
882	3	In the story it explained the beauty of the night, also about the outdoors and how it is effecting his trip. The features of the setting effects the cyclist, because the setting was mild, sounded warm and calm. Also it showed how it contains to us. The setting was similar to the cyclist. That�s how the features of the setting effects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
886	3	The cyclist had a couple of affects in his journy. One of them was he hills the it was a problem because it used most of his energy and slowed him down. The other one was water, the lack of water. If the had enerf water he would have gotten a boost that would have kept him going.	2	1		2																					
890	3	"It is my hot so the cyclist is very dehydrated, tired and lack of water. �I checked my water supply and heated on� is a good example oF this. There is also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around this bars the cyclists hope of finding civilization. Also not seeing any building and when he sees are it being deserted makes this very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he @CAPS1 the pump that has tar, dirt, then hot water in it. Also the road plays a toll on him. I know this house he says �If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill I�ll be alright"".This is how I know the setting and features in the setting is affecting the cyclists mentally and physically."	1	1		1																					
891	3	Hot, alone, no water � all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is very hot as the cyclist is riding. This makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated. The cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight. If anything happened to him there is no one to help. The cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy. With very little water it is hard to stay hydrated. Hot, alone, no water- all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
892	3	The terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big affect on them. The first example of this is in they are riding on hills, it makes it much harder for them. For example when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to ride on hills he was, olcasly disappointed. Another thing that affects cyclist is the smothness of the road they are riding on. In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the main character came to rough spot in the road and was disappointed and didn�t want to ride it. Another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat. Several times in the story, the cyclists says that he is tired and dehydrated, at one point he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke. Those are the effects of the rider�s setting have on him/her.	2	2		2																					
893	3	"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" has a major effect on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..       "	3	3		3																					
898	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed� by @PERSON1 the settings of the story effects the rider in manyways. The first and most obvious is the temperature, it is hot, therefore the rider is hot and becoming dehydrated making him thirsty. A second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him. Since nothing is around him there is no where for him to get water adding to the affect of dehydration making him more thiristy. The rider says �One ran shacle shed, sevral rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn�t hold the lamestmal egreeted me. ''This statement from the author support the factt that nothing is around. Onemore feature of the setting that affected the rider was the hills. The hills made the rider tired requiring more pedalind and wearing him out, the setting features had agreat afect on the rider from heat and dehydration to hills and energy. onething that the setting didnt have was a positive affected on the rider.	2	2		2																					
901	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way. For example, A tarlike substance oozed followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This affects him because cant get water from the well. So this means he needs water, but cannot get water. Also in the essay it says the terrain is bad so that means that the cyclist has to pedal harder to keep moving and he has to work harder to hot reek. So all this puts affect on him from just whats around him. The old abbandon factory with the boy drinking juice was had the  most effect on the cyclist because he was so thirsty and that was when he was about to give up. In this essay the setting had alot of affect on the cyclist to were he thought he might die."	2	2		2																					
903	3	The @CAPS1 is affected in many ways. The major thing that effects him is the lack of water. Throughout the story he mentions the lack of water. He also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route. For example, �I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off thire porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� The @CAPS1 says things about the older gentle man throughout the story.	2	2		2																					
907	3	In the short story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of, old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their parches since carter was in office, �and quickly realized that he shouldn�t have. The author describes the setting of the first �town� as, �the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This didn�t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and corral that couldn�t hold in the largest mule.� Was what met him there. The cyclist said that �this sight was troubling.� It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This short story shows how anything can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival.	2	2		2																					
909	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,� That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.� This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
910	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affected the cyclist in the story. �Not two miles into this next reaction of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (kurmaskie). the cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy, than flat riding. This energy, loss coupled with the cyclist lack of water causes him to become even more miserable. The setting of this story greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
911	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist mood and behavior. First the cyclist sees from believing the shortcut will help him arrive to Yosemite faster then he relies it wont. Next, the harsh sun and rafh terrain and lack of water causes the cyclist to give up hope that he will make it to yosemite and causes him to rethink his judgement and taking advice from others.	1	2		2																					
912	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in a harsh way. At first, the cyclist was fine and going strong, but soon after the first ""ghost town� he was getting weak. Then the cyclist had to face a few problems. For example he was running low on water. Also, he faced rough roads last, he faced snakes and abandonment. The cyclist had to face many obstacles, but in the end, he pulled through strong."	1	1		1																					
913	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist for these reasons. It says �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling.� That showshow how the features affected the cyclist because he says the sight was troubling. It  troubled him because he wanted water and he seen the rusty pumps that reminded him of water but he new their was no water or it was nasty	1	1		1																					
914	3	The conditions of the enviroment as well as the road can majory effect the cyclist. For example If some one was riding a bike in warm wheather on flat land it would not take major determination to pedal. On the other hand if it is hot and rough paths and hilly roads the biker colud dehidrate and it takes much more effort to get up and over the hill. Those five the conditions of the enviroment effect a cyclist greatly.	2	1		2																					
915	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist, on his way to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the rough deserts of California. As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, as is the sand. There is no water anywhere and dangerous, highly venomous creatures are abundant. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grope juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere. Until, finally, he reaches a modern area and drinks from the sink in the bathroom.	2	2		2																					
918	3	The dessert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, their would be no refills because the pump was only giving � tarlike substance� said the text. With the lack of water dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the � ridiculously large snake� he had seen. A finale effect would be mirages that could loose your judgement. This man double checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by �[wipping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage,� Through all the toughest desser obsticles the character was able to take the short cut and survive heat, dehydration, and animals of the dessert.	2	2		2																					
920	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very sevior situation. The cyclist was in a desert. Like terria, which was not dinsely populated on his trail, there was a lack of fresh water supplys, and the tempatures is more extreme. The cyclist could easily have faintid from heatstroke, due to the lack of water and excessive heat and work that his was doing peatling. Had the area been more populated, he would have had more chances to stock up on water greatly indecriasing his risk of heat stroke. There was also the snakes which presentid danger for him, has he been bitting then he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the closet help which could proven fetal. Had the setting been, say a city park, on a populated country side, them thi setting would had provided exponeutaly loss prodioms and dangers for the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
922	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he�s in the middle of nowhere with no water. The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.� This quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car. 	2	1		2																					
925	3	�Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from �old timers� the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that�s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn�t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn�t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn�t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. 	3	3		3																					
927	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if they weren�t hills and rough roads, he would of been able to get to yosemite park faster and he wouldn�t of ran out of water.	1	1		1																					
928	3	The setting was the main affect on the cyclist. He said it was hot and that he was lost. The cyclist had no clue were he was going and it was hot out side. He seemed very strest and that only made it worse for him. He was thirsty from all riding and the heat so he trys to get water from a water pump. The water that was in it was horable. He called it a �substance� it had a flavor of battery acid. �If he were not lost and if it were cool outside he would have water and he would not be so upset. The setting of a hot and lost place had a huge impact on the cyclist.     	2	2		2																					
930	3	Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, ��The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him.	2	2		2																					
932	3	The feature's of the setting affect the cyclist because the condition's he is in without any water. the cyclist would be fine if he would have had more water for his trip. He ran out of water not to for into  his journey thanks to the heat of the setting he was in. the cyclist makes this statement. I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June�. The cyclist is saying that since it is so  hot where he is he has to take regular drinks of water so he stays highdrated throughout is trip. It is also saying that in the mountians with less air and how hot it is he is not doing as well as he thought he would on the trip.	1	2		2																					
934	3	The cyclist has to endure ruff treain and bad road condisions and a lack of water is the ??? near did not help the prodlem. Ther was a good prasority he could have heat strock then his hope was stll up by a abonded welches take factry.	1	1		1																					
935	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1� the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn�t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn�t have been so worried. What�s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn�t have struggled so much at the end. �At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.  	2	3		3																					
937	3	In the essay �Rough road ahead: do not exeed posted speed limit,� the author is continually depressed, by the features of the landscape he passes. At first he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water, this sight doesn�t bothe him. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a �rusted water pump,� and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path then he passes an abandoned Welch�s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. The setting its features serve to dissappoint depress the cyclist in his quest to find water.	3	2		3																					
940	3	When the cyclist is going on his trip, he is riding through as desert. All he sees the entire journey is a flat rode and dirt. He is riding on the road; hopelssly hoping for some form of lif. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. �The author is trying to be positive but it�s hard, because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert. Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn�t be that worried, there�s water and shade. He has none of that in the desert. This whole journey was all mental. He always kept in his mind that everything would be ok. That is what helped him survive. This is an ispiring story, to anyone who needs a push to stey optionistic.	2	2		2																					
941	3	Poor directions heat, and lack of water affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is confident in the directions which would, �slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.�  As the story progresses, the cyclist is no longer so confident. The �heat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.� I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was near heat stroke. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him. His perseverance paid off. �Then , as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. The cyclist had found a barst shop and recteved water.	3	3		3																					
942	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of @LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has almost no water left. This lack of water makes the cyclist desperate for food and water. The setting has a lot to do with how the cyclist reacts to what happens.  	1	1		1																					
943	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, because there was no one in sight he couldn�t ask for any help or direction. Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didn�t help him it just tired him more. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have biten him and then he wouldn�t be able to make it anywhere because of the bite. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
945	3	When the rider was riding his bike in such day settings has started to need water he was running out, So his whole adventure was to find water. Being thirsty was very hard because it made him not want to keep going because he was so tired. It made him harder on him. But it also got him more strength and because in himself, and keep on pushing. 	1	1		1																					
946	3	�Do not Exceed the posted speed limit� tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of �the serenity of an early summer evening,� and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the �town� he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclist�s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.	3	3		3																					
947	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. For example, the story said,""I gathered up a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth"" This quote explains that the setting was very and had pebbles. The setting benefiting him by taking the thrist off his mind. If their wasn't any pebbles by the cyclist he @MONTH1 not have made it. In cocnlusion in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the cyclist was benefited by the features of the setting."	1	1		1																					
950	3	The complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story. His trip goes from bad to worse as he progresses to Yosemite. After taking directions from the �old codgers,� the author attempts the shortcut, but is dissapointed. He arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted. He rubbed it off though, and kept �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,� as his motivation. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued. Just as if things couldn�t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope. He became even more of a pessimist when �a ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavement�� He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned. He even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration. When he finally found the fish camp, he was relieved. All the obstacles he prospered through were worth in the end.	2	1		2																					
951	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in �Do not exceed posted speed limit� had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist�s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. �It didn�t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.	2	3		3																					
956	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, �I  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.� In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water.	1	2		2																					
958	3	The setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way. �About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town� (Kurmaskie). The cyclist put the words towns in to parentasis because it was actually a Ghost town. no on lived there, It was abandoned. Around the cyclist was deserts, and more empty towns. The father the cyclist got, the more we realized the old men were wrong as the cyclest was running low on water and there was no where to stop. He finally found some and vowed to never listen to old mens directions again.	2	2		2																					
959	3	All the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strerigth. It seems like he might have collapsed it he hadn't thought he was going to @CAPS1, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him.	2	2		2																					
961	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didn�t bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer way. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling. Moreover, it was a June day and in June the days are hot with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated. This is how the setting affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
962	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, his body heat raised a good bit. They don�t come out and say it, but they do say, �The sun was beginning to beat down.� We all know that it your out side when it�s hot, you get hot too. It also probably added to his dehydryeon. As a long distance running, I know what the sun will do to you during a hot day. That is how the setting affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
963	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
966	3	"The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit definitely affected the author. The cyclist states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate  through the ""hills"" as opposed to the ""Flat roads,"" making him more quickly tired. The speaker states, �I could drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a �heatstroke� which could slow him down. The speaker also states,""water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees""(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated. Many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist.  "	3	2		3																					
969	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a �run-down� rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.	3	3		3																					
970	3	The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble.	1	1		1																					
971	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because It give it more life. More meaning and make I fun to read.	0	0		0																					
973	3	The setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� really goes against the cycilist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page @NUM1 it says, �a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn�t cool down,� This explains how bad the water was when the cycilist was there.	1	1		1																					
976	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water. When he coudnt.	1	2		2																					
977	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was �travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the �sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,� which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist	2	3		3																					
978	3	In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it�s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It�s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn�t take the old mans advice.	3	2		3																					
979	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was died tried he/she didn�t have anything to drink. The essay stated how would say she/he would save the water til the end. He /she was so tired so the lack of water really affect him/her. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions.	2	2		2																					
980	3	I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, �I could drop from heatstroke�. Meaning, its really hot! Also, l think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him because it says in the passage, �l eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�. This has a big affect on him, because he�s very thirsty. Also, l think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars. I think all these things affect him.	2	2		2																					
982	3	He feels alone there is noune around him to push him, and yet he keeps going trying to push him self to the end to win. The fast roads are rough and the hills are tall but he is a determined to finish.	1	1		1																					
984	3	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One reason was that he was in the desert. Like in the quote �through high deserts of California. This means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke. Then he couldn�t even get any water. Like on the quote �of the rusted water pump.� it was describing how old it was then the cyclist got some out but it tasted like old battery acid. Therefore the features and setting afected The cyclist.	2	1		2																					
987	3	"In the essay �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldn�t hold in the lamest mule.� This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
988	3	The author�s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist�s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he�s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person�s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.	3	2		3																					
991	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. �I noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling @NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
993	3	The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others. As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat. In one sentence the effect of the heat were clearly described by the cyclist	1	1		1																					
995	3	"The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride easy for him or tough for him. In the essay it said ""No Town"" but without a town theres no water and water @MONTH1 lead to dehydration. It also says something about flat roads turning into ""short, rolling hills."" This means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused. Those are some examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.  "	2	2		2																					
998	3	The futures of the setting affect the cyclist was that he show the maD to other people and he shouldn�t (ister) to others where he had it to go.	1	1		1																					
1000	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, �They�d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey.	1	1		1																					
1001	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit �the cyclist has some very rough obstacles on his way to Yosemite National park. With his lack of water and diredness he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black. He easily passes the snake and moves on. Being in the intense heat and with know water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he go's this way is because @NUM1 �old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office�. These guys gave him wrong directions. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other stuff wouldn�t have happened if he payed attention to his surroundings and people around him.	2	2		2																					
1002	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch�s Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water $ be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of liFe or building. Therefore his surrouding throughout the story make him indifferent, confident & relieved.   	3	2		3																					
1004	3	The setting affect of a cyclist can be petty complicated. So many things has to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up have to be prepared for the weather. For example when there is serious weather conditions like rain,snow you have to careful of ley roads.Also they have to be prepared for is long riais. Some naes might be from @NUM1 miles the have to bring plenty of food and water. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike. For instance he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going cooperate. Also if work need's to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on.Also another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist is in shape. For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint.	1	1		1																					
1006	3	The setting in the short story; �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit� greatly affects the cyclist. The rough terrain and blazing sun test him and make him suffer in ways he never imagined. One point, after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes, �Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� this setting has caused the cyclist to become so dehydrated that he can�t think. The cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him. As you can see the setting has a very strong affect on the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1007	3	The cyclist was affected by long hours of riding the bike into the areas where he never been.	1	1		1																					
1008	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist is affected by the setting mently and physicly. For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don�t think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way	2	2		2																					
1010	3	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such a empty terran that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strenght to go on and get to safty.	1	1		1																					
1015	3	The features like not enough water not enough sense of direction, effect the cyclist because he needs water to keep on peadiling. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going. From not enough water he said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and there been sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that pargraph� That site ment that the old man�s sense of directin was out of date. They did not no where any thing was at just there in giant poarch.	1	1		1																					
1017	3	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist�s mood and energy. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself.	2	2		2																					
1019	3	All the features of the settings affect his rythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can. Instead of thinking about it. If I was him I would just ride my bike & think about I thing winning!	1	1		1																					
1020	3	To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was given very old directions. He was given back roads that are abandoned now. These towns had no people in them normally that would not matter, but he �was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� (@NUM1). If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A �ghost town� with no good water could have killed him. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them.	2	2		2																					
1024	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way.	2	1		2																					
1025	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly be coming dehydrated. Another feature is that all the building seem to be either abandoned or in despair.	1	1		1																					
1027	3	"The setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome. The author makes a mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by @LOCATION2 standards, where it gets to @NUM1 degrees, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at @NUM2. By noon, it's past @NUM3. Also, the author comes to a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� @CAPS1 he makes note that he�s only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last ""tentalizing sips,"" This is his main problem, his lack of water. He drank most of it in the beginning of his ride, thinking he�d be okay, but he regretted it later on"	2	2		2																					
1029	3	Because he is dehydrated, the setting makes him worse. He�s biking, in California, in @LOCATION2. It�s not and the sun is probably scorching. The heat plus all the biking he�s doing, is making him even more thirsty and tired.	1	1		1																					
1031	3	Features of the setting affect cyclists greatly. Things like weather, terrain, temperature, altitude can make or break a cyclist. In this essay, the heat and hills on the road challenge the cyclist. He just keeps going through, and eventually he gets to civilization. This lets you know that you can�t mother nature control you.	1	1		1																					
1032	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The author is getting worn out and is rapidly running out of water. He �was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. This shows how the setting is causing him to become greatly exhausted.	1	1		1																					
1033	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist tremendously. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles until he passed through the flat round, that was replaced by short rolling hills. He said and I quoted �I toiledon� he sounds like it�s hopeless, that he wasn�t going to make it. As you can see the setting does effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1034	3	The setting of �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of louage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there. �I got down on my hands, and knees, working,the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength. He was so thirst and tired he didn�t know how else to get some water	1	1		1																					
1036	3	"The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because it�s a dry area in California in June. The cyclist really needs water which is the main thing affecting him besides the fact that he�s lost in a ghost town. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed."	1	1		1																					
1037	3	"The feature of the cyclist was very good �it erodding to who he say in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1�. I would describe it as a fun. It also looks this time was one of his bes time. Here are some examples he is happy, competive, and thin is full. I�m going to explain my examples. First, he looks hoppy becaus in the story he said �the morning with strong legs and smile on my face. the phase can to you how hoppy he felt. My second example was competive, he seems like a competive person, bcouse he is very heathy and lead to to take a ride from the bike. My third example is the way he is becasse he soid ""As easily as sounding  bond, my trouble, thirst and fears were all behind me the part made me feel.  "	1	2		2																					
1038	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes �that road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road. The speed limit is also affect the cyclist. When the the speed limit sign is appear, the character feels �life can feel so cruel� (kurmaskie @NUM1). It tells us that character can not do what he is trying to do. The bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1042	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist is many different ways. One way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out. Since the cyclist is getting worn out he needs to drink more and more water. Now that he�s drinking more water his running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it. Then when he starts to use less water to conserve it until he gets to the next town he starts to become dehydrated and more tired and he starts to feel weak. Also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired. It also starts to get hotter and he gets thirsty more often. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1043	3	In the poem �Do not exceed speed limit� the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says �At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake� This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read �Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.	1	1		1																					
1044	3	The feature of it is the landscape the characters the plot the end and the begining.     	0	0		0																					
1045	3	The setting in �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits� affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the �cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on �there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.� At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out.	2	2		2																					
1047	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn�t so hot, then he wouldn�t of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn�t help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1048	3	The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� affect the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The fact that there was nothing around him, made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he�s going to die. He shows that he�s lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from �old-timers who haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving.	3	2		3																					
1050	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. �... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�. This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist.	1	1		1																					
1051	3	The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectaculiar and amazing like. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasn�t what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story.	1	1		1																					
1053	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the @LOCATION1, where it�s nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. He�s excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch�s Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again.	2	3		3																					
1054	3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .� The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,� In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it � had been a Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.� For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    	3	2		3																					
1056	3	During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasn�t even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low. Then , what is originally a sign of hope because another let down. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach �rough roads� creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait �tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more.	3	3		3																					
1057	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the bad condition roads. The was also hills so they made it harder for the cyclists.	1	1		1																					
1058	3	�There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. This adaodoness makes it hard for the cycleist to frot hope and threes as where to get water. �I could drop from a heat strote in a gorgeous day in June, hes in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around no one this make's him very desperate since hes adaodoned.	1	2		2																					
1059	3	The main features that affected the cyclist were the ruff terrain and the hot sun. The rough terrain made it harder to pedal and it tired the cyclist out faster. But also helping was the hot sun because it would dehydrate him while he was riding. So between the hard to pedal rough terrain and the dehydratiog hot sun, the cyclist was very affect to the point of exausition.	1	1		1																					
1062	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people, and cars on his �shortcut� he was in great doubt of his survival. �I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.� He thought he wouldn�t get any water because there was nothing around him and he thought he would die of dehydration or heatstroke. �And the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke.�	2	2		2																					
1064	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert. Also, the author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was beaming on him.	1	1		1																					
1067	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn�t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn�t in a �ghost town�, with the, �sun beggining to beat down�. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, �about forty miles into the petal�, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot.	2	2		2																					
1068	3	The features of the setting is very important for cyclist. If the setting is wrong they could be in many danger. It is really important to have a clear setting.	1	1		1																					
1070	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for �rough road ahead,� @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging.	3	3		3																					
1071	3	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they�re water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest.	1	1		1																					
1073	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, �A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didn�t have much to drink until the next town. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills� (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen� (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted.	3	2		3																					
1074	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn�t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn�t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn�t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn�t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn�t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don�t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better.	3	2		3																					
1076	3	"After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,�water-deplating� one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as �rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrator�s hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally."	2	3		3																					
1077	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power.	2	2		2																					
1078	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways.for example, he ask the older guts, ""that haven't left rheir porches since carter was in the office where the next placewas to get water. Also he was out in the middle of nowhere. It was also in June were the weather was warm,and he didn't have a lot of water."	1	1		1																					
1079	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in �high desert of California in June.� This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1082	3	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him.	1	1		1																					
1083	3	The setting desented in the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer�s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.	2	2		2																					
1085	3	The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , �like a foolish yuuth,� folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He �ans almost dehydrated and �in an ironic twist� he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: �Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we�re your best bet � in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who �haven�t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office�	3	3		3																					
1088	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died.	2	1		2																					
1089	3	The features in the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affect the biker. For example, the heat is constantly drying the biker out. Also, at the first town the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause with water tastd like �battery acid�. Even after that were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit. The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along ride. The pebbles that he found helps him out. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip. In conclusion, the setting makes the riders journey an  one, but in the end the bait store had just what he needed.	2	2		2																					
1091	3	The hot wheather is dehydrating the cyclist, who can�t find more water. The hills are rough terrain is draining the energy he has. The heat is so rough he has to break the road down it to polants he wants to get to. He get drained physically and emotionally. He has a hard journey.	1	1		1																					
1092	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not. On the posts �Do not exceed posted speed limit �is after �wide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�. This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. �a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist.  	2	1		2																					
1093	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, �by Joe Kurmaskie had many obsticales to over come. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, �@CAPS1 my gosh, what did I get myself into?!� Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in.	2	2		2																					
1094	3	The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because, he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehygrated it's not healthy and you die from it. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down,along with the sweat. As long as he has some lijid left, it should be ohang. 	1	1		1																					
1096	3	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If it�s too hot, you�re going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If it�s all down hill, it�s really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out. Features of the setting really affect a cyclist	2	1		2																					
1098	3	The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist. First, it is a very hot dry in June. The cyclist is maneuvering his way through �high deserts in @LOCATION1� where he comes across many hills that he must climb over and maneuver his way down. With all of these obstacles and the heat slowing him down he will need water but is already low.	1	1		1																					
1099	3	"In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasnt traveling in a car, he was riding a bike and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike. ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel.� In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he�s at risk of running out. Not only that but he�s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.� I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.� So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings. "	3	2		3																					
1100	3	"The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people. When he got into the first town he had ran out of water to drink but the towns water he was in now tasted like battery acid so that�s not safe to drink. As he started to head out the scenery changed. �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore."	2	2		2																					
1102	3	The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says �About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town.� This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was �going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch�s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy. The conditions affected the cyclist	3	2		3																					
1105	3	While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listen to some old  men who gave him directions for a shortcut.When he began his trip everything was fine.But then he found that along the �shortcut� there was no building.By the time he figured out that the old men were mistake he had almost run out of water.There was nothing around that he could drink.He was getting very thirsty.The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn�t make his task any easier.About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills, which made his trip even harder.Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his strength to get to it just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory.This made going without water much harder as well as he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice.In the end he finally make it to a pait shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could	3	3		3																					
1107	3	One ramsackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubled. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck, I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didn�t take the old mans advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride he needed a new map.	3	2		3																					
1109	3	"People who travel will almost always encounter difficulties. For the main character in this story, thus a very true. His first mistake was when he took directions from the �old-timers� by doing that, he travelled extremely far out of his way. In the story he talked to the old men on the porch. He said, �what I shouldn�t have done was to let them see my map"".  Another problem he faced was when he began to run out of water.  This caused a problem to him because of dehydration. In the story he said, �The water bottle contained any a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, another problem he encountered was the desert area that he was riding through. This caused problem for him because there wasn�t anybody around to help him if he needed it. In the story he says, �There was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind.� By reading this story, we�ve realized that people encounter problems everywhere, however any problem, no matter what size, can be overcomed"	1	1		1																					
1110	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because on page @NUM1 it talk about how the cyclist had to go down a hill then find a factory for juice. Like if the cyclist don�t find any building he would of kept the hill and wasted the little bit of energy for actaire.	1	1		1																					
1111	3	Since the cyclist was really thirsty, the setting was not very appealing considering it was a desert. You could tell she was stressing because she was sweating and having a trouble time trying to pedal.	1	1		1																					
1112	3	The setting effects the cyclist in away that most people can�t tell cycling forty miles on maybe a gallon of water is hard expecialy in California �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June� The effect on his body would be rather devastating.	1	1		1																					
1114	3	The biker has many features in his story. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example �One long, crippling hill� I can picture it in my head. �There was no one in sight.� All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help.	1	1		1																					
1127	3	"The features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also make him determined to escape them. He passes �ghost towns,� �abandoned buildings,� and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of �dropping� dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing �what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy."" He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns it all into a lesson he�ll surely abide by: follow the map!"	3	3		3																					
1128	3	The cyclist is affected by the heat, the hills, and the lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing short on water and had �wide rings of dried sweat on his on shirt,� and he could �drop from heatstroke.� The hills must have forced him to use more energy, and lasely  the land of people. If the towns still had people the cyclist wouldn�t have been as affected by the setting.	1	1		1																					
1130	3	The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard. It has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy. Also, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry. This makes the author need more water than he normally would. The author said ��I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without water, he said ��I could drop from heatstroke�� If the setting had been cooler there would not be so much danger.	2	2		2																					
1132	3	The setting affects the cyclist because there were lots of hills and very little water.	1	1		1																					
1133	3	The cyclist in the story rough road ahead Do not exeed posted speed limit, by Joe kurmashie, is heavily affected by the features of the setting in the story. First is the �shorecay� that is suggested to get    to @CAPS1, which naturally just ends up separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water. His water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die. In the story, he says: �It really didn�t matter. I was going to die and the lards would pick me clean.� This shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless.	2	2		2																					
1135	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. In the story it says, ""I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" This is telling the reader that the weather was hot and you need a lot of water here to survive, especially if you are riding a bike or working. Later on in the story it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This quote gives the reader information and tells us that the cyclist is having a hard time surviving through the harsh features of the setting through the harsh features of the setting. In California deserts I know from prior knowledge it is hot and dry, exspecially in the summer. If you are working outside, like the cyclist in this story is, and you do not have water to drink, you will get dehydrated which eventually leads to death. The author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
1137	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist when he got tired very easily because he was biking in the desert in June. There are no rivers in the that desert so he couldn�t get water. It is so hot out there that he couldn�t see very well because of all the sweat that went into his eyes. Also there are no people out there because of how hot it is.	1	1		1																					
1140	3	The features in the setting, affected the cyclist in many ways. The first way the features in the setting affected the cyclist is that the whole trail was desearted leaving him alone with no water. In the story it says �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time � say, before the last world war � but on that morning it fit the traditional defination of a ghost town, �this explains that he was alone and that the first town he visited was deserted. The next example of how the features and the settings	2	3		3																					
1141	3	The featers of the setting afected the cyclist by the lack of water made him tiered and a bit deloshional. The lack of shade increased the rate of dehidrashion. The rough road made it hard to balinc. And the snack slowed him dowen. He thought that he was going to die.	1	2		2																					
1142	3	"The setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" is very important to the events that occured in the  story. For example the story was set on a  highway set at @NUM1 which the cyclist was only able to do @NUM2. This is signifigant to the events of the story because since he was doing @NUM2, which by the away is a lot for a cyclist and it led to almost dehydration. Plus it was hilly. This led to the excution of the cyclist, so one could see that setting is very important to the outcome of the story."	2	2		2																					
1145	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead; Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the setting is integral to how the cyclist feels and behaves. The cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively move bleak. In the beginning of the trip, the cyclist encounters a ghost town. ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" The cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is ""troubling."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic. Farther down the road, the terrain of the road changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name."" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting @NUM1. Sometimes life�s can feel so cruel."" The cyclist�s surroundings get progressively worse as he rides on, but even tually he finds a place with working water. He is so overjoyed by this building that he wants to find the owners, and kiss them."	3	3		3																					
1150	3	Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, @CAPS1 through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a domper on your experience, @CAPS2  it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation.	3	3		3																					
1151	3	The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite @ORGANIZATION1�l Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it wouldve made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle @MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn�t. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn�t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It�s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it. 	2	3		3																					
1152	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways For example, the fact that he is pedaling a bike �through the high deserts of California in June, make the intensity level of the story very high. If it would have been @DATE1 and there was a nice breeze it would be different.	1	1		1																					
1153	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1154	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that if it�s hot and your riding a long way you need a lot of water so you don�t  dehydrated. Also it can affect your vision cause you looking at the sun. Another way cyclist can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape it can affect the way they ride there bike.	1	1		1																					
1155	3	 The story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1 had some statements that we were kind of pointless to put in. One of sentence in the essay had a couple word that don�t need to be used. In the sentence, about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first �town,� I don�t think �into the pedal needs to be in there because its not describing anything.	1	1		1																					
1159	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June.Their is also a lack of water, some must pace his sips carefully. Therefore also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life.  The dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist. His journey does teach you though, that trough determination you will be rewarded. You have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to get success.	3	3		3																					
1163	3	The setting affects the cyclist because one he should have stack to his own map. He should have packed an extra bottle of water. @NUM1 not take any advice from people that haven�t left the porch in years.	2	1		2																					
1165	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclists because he was thirsty and it was hot and he was almost out of water and he almost died because when he was drinking the water and he hit a bump and spit got lodged in his throat and tiring hills it seemed to never end.	1	1		1																					
1168	3	The features of the setting really affect the cyclist. He is led into false pretenses by the immediate surroundings. Little does he know that it would bring him into danger? When he comes to a rock in the road and finds that the water pumps are not good he is in serious danger. In the reading it says �The sun was beginning to heat down, but it hardly noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.� The setting let the cyclists mind wonder so much that he didn�t even realize the heat.	1	1		1																					
1173	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldn�t get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake.� They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted �I eased past.� When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist�s journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other �GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, we�re your BEST BET.""The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect. These are features that had an affect on the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1174	3	"The setting affected the cyclist: due to the changes in terrain. A rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills. The author wrote, �I tolld on""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory. The narration states, �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words ""long"" and ""crippling."" @CAPS1 of those words provide feelings of being drug on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip."	3	3		3																					
1175	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who haden�t gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldn�t get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip.	2	3		3																					
1176	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, he cannot get water and becomes dehydrated, then, he goes on a rough ride and loses more energy. Then he finds the bait and gets water. All of these greatly affect the cyclists condition.	1	1		1																					
1177	3	The setting of the cyclist�s journey effected him because if he was a tot desert in california. This effected him because he had to ride a bike throug it and he heat took a lot out of him. He didn�t have a lot of water because there were no rivers or water supply because of the desert surrounding him. At the end he finds a store which affects him because he gets a cool drink and same supplies which helped him. So in the end his surroundings destroyed him and then relieved him.	2	2		2																					
1178	3	"The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park and on the way ran out of water. ""The wate bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� Then, hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� The rider didn�t think he would live �I was going to die and the birds would pick he clean� but he found a place to get water �drank deeply from the sink� and finished his ride."	2	2		2																					
1179	3	In the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn�t have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated.	3	3		3																					
1182	3	"In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is his lack of water:"" The water bottles contained only a few tantallizing sips. The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the welch�s grape juice factory. The  building-abandoned years earlier-had been a welch�s grape juice factory and bottling plant."" This despersion, after he had come to the abondoned factory, was followed by dissapointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abondoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1183	3	No water, rough terran, bad info-all are reasons why the boy isn�t doing so well I said no water because he is dehidrated but needs to soae his water. Also he could die from heat exauston. I also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help. And to top it off he took info from old people that didn�t know what they were talking about. Theas leave all examples about the essay that support my writing.	2	2		2																					
1185	3	A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting. One feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard times on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling ??? know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks  on us. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature.	3	2		3																					
1186	3	The features of the setting inhance the cyclist�s desparate spirit. Throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people, cars, or buildings around. This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as �Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant� which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation.	2	2		2																					
1187	3	"In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the road, he saw that the terrain was changing and that scared him, he says �This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly �(kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes. He wasn�t going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone he still had the courage to go further. The setting brought him fear but he made it through."	2	3		3																					
1189	3	"The features of the setting, in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affects the cyclist. The setting affect him both physically and mentally. In the story the setting provides no water for the cyclist making him weak. In the mental aspect he is greatly affected by the features of the setting. An example of this is when so see the abandoned welch's factory and sees the picture of a boy ""pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth�. This made him hang his head as he rode on. He is also thinking to himself that he will die out of here. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	1		2																					
1191	3	When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite he stumbled into a million setting. One in the begining when he was talking to the old men on the porch and having him set of into the distance of nothing but dessert. �one rameshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� It�s only him.� At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like ma diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Tumble weed usually mean's desert. He also saw the @CAPS1 grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions.	1	2		2																					
1193	3	The cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1 suffers from some hardship while riding through the desert. The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation that means there is no water so he was becoming dehydrated. Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldn�t quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasn�t been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welch�s juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved. Also the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left, and rocky tent to take more strength and endurance.	2	3		3																					
1196	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, the setting affects the way that the cyclist rides. In this story, the setting is out in nowhere wit no water, and all he can see is roads. This affects the cyclist because he is hungry, thirsty,and now he's about to go down a really steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously insuring himself with noone around to get help from the setting of nowhere affects the cyclist in this story.	1	1		1																					
1198	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,� this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time. The is why I think the salling affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1199	3	In the essay intitled �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� It talks about a gentlemen who is riding a bike to �Yosemite� and he does not know exactly how to get there. So he stops and ask some old folks and he says �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porchers since Carter was in office.� @CAPS1 means they are not familiar with the changes. After he leaves the old-folks he continues on his long hot journey. He begins to run out of water and so he begins to panic. Next he comes to the sign that said �Rough	1	1		1																					
1200	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is so hot the cyclist keeps drink and sweating water so he is really work down from dehydration and fatigue. Also just the feeling of how unsafe it is out there. Like how he saw a ridiculously large snake or how it just keep getting hotter.	1	1		1																					
1202	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The text first mentions that, �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.� This shows that the cyclist felt in saccure and was starting to upset him. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist is, �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� You can see through the cyclists that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps were lame. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, �battery acid,� that he wouldn�t last much longer. In- conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. 	1	1		1																					
1203	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a �ramshackle shed� surrounded by �several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lames mule�, he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he can�t make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says �sometimes life can be so cruel� as he notices the speed limit to be @NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesn�t believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation �should please all sadists� reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling.	3	3		3																					
1204	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn�t stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn�t know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasn�t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldn�t cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey.	2	2		2																					
1205	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. First the rolling hills make it hard to pedal over the land. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" shows that the terrain was changing into a more difficult course. One long crippling hill,"" also shows how the hills had an effect on the cyclist. Another feature of the setting was the desert and the high temperatures. This caused the cyclist to become dehydrated. ""Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state"" and ""I could drop from heatstroke"" show me how hot the cyclist was. One final feature that has on effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive. ""I hung my head"" and ""abandoned factory of juices and dreams"" tell how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building. All of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1206	3	The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, He is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, ��but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst�� This @CAPS1 is saying that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to get his mind off of how thirsty he was. I think this @CAPS1 is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that effected how thirsty the cyclist got was how hard he worked which was also a feature of the setting since during the end of his trip, he met rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat even more than he was. This made him @NUM1 more dehydrated. This story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you.	2	2		2																					
1207	3	There are several features of the setting which affect the cyclist one is the fact that he is traveling on a hot day in June. �and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot @DATE1. �I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more. These glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, he was running out of water and there was rough terrain. The setting was not in the cyclist's favor.	3	3		3																					
1210	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it makes it hard for him to get to �@CAPS1 National Park�. He took advice from some old men to take a shortcut to get him where he wanted to be. On his ride there, he stopped at a �town�, which was, to him, considered a ghost town. Then he got to a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, but it was abandoned years earlier and he was becoming weak and dehydrated. He thought he would drop from a heatstroke. At the end of his ride, he reached a fish camp where he found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, �Know the best way to get there?� The man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist told the man �yes, sir: I own a very good map�. The man realized throughout the setting on his journey, that he would never accept advice from old-timers again.	1	1		1																					
1211	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit� the setting affected the cyclist sense of direction. The cyclist knew where he was going and how to get there but the old men told him their �short-cut.� It ruined his own sense of direction because he was taking out-dated directions from �old-timers that hadn�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� That is how the setting affected the cyclist in the's essay.	1	1		1																					
1212	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness then it motivates you more. Than when there is a lot en stuff around you.	0	0		0																					
1216	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is that on his way he had to deal with so many things. Like for ex he had trouble with the flat roads that was replaced by short, rolling hills. The next thing was there was a sign that was posted he could not ride @NUM1 he had to do @NUM2 and that made him disappointed. Then a large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. He became dehydrated. He became sad, hopless but still had energy to feel himself.	2	2		2																					
1219	3	I the essays the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch. The directions seem incorrect at first. The remains of a Grape Juice factory make it seem like he will never find civilization.	1	1		1																					
1220	3	The features of the setting around the cyclist affected him to the point of exauhstion and dehydration. The cycllist being exauhsted and dehydrated,or tired and thirsty, was beging to wear as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs. The cyclist exlained the change by saying, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist�s idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hill of this californian desert rollar coaster. His water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud.	2	2		2																					
1221	3	The setting effected the cyclist severly. Biking in the desert following outdated directions nearly got him killed. He also came across several broken down factories and towns causing more dismay. However he came across a last stop that saved his life.	1	1		1																					
1222	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclistis affected by his surrounding. At first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground. His confidence is high, and he is ready to continue his adventure. As the day went on and all he could find was abondoned buildings he began to worry a bit water running low he come upon �one ram shackled shed, several rusty pumps� no sign of life. He realiced that his trip was going to be rough. The environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, he knew �travelling through the high deserts of California in June� his only chances of survival was to keep going. The mans surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp. If he had not been so aware of his surroundings he might have given up, but not making it out of the desert to �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite� would be to devastating	1	2		2																					
1223	3	The setting affects the rider because it is very hot wich makes him thirsty. how long the road witch affect his mind state and last the fact that ??? is in sight and that affect is coral	1	1		1																					
1225	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. When he was going up hill it was harder for him to pedal. The hot summer day was breaking him down. He was getting dehydrated because he had a little bit of water left. It said he was trying to keep his balance in my dehydrated state. He felt like giving up.	1	1		1																					
1227	3	The setting features affected the cyclist because it was a conflict. It was a conflict because it was hot and he was lost. I was a confict that he was hot because he had a limited amount of water. Which he could get anymoe of because he was lost. The heat causes people to get thirsty but he couldn't because he was limited in water.Another conflict was that he was lost. This was a conflict that because he needed to be some where.	1	1		1																					
1231	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn�t have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn�t bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldn�t see anything in sight.	3	3		3																					
1234	3	Well in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limits by @PERSON1 the setting affects you because if you cant see any thing for miles and you are running out of water it has a sycological effect on you. You can start to panick like he did when it stoped in the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. Also you don know exactly where you are so that also affects u because you don�t know where to go or if you should turn back or what. If I was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me. 	2	2		2																					
1236	3	There were many features of the setting that had affected the cyclist. One of the features was the lack of water. This had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right. It had also made the cyclist have less energy. An example is, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� @CAPS1 feature is the heat. The heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty. An example is �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� @CAPS1 example is, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The features of the setting had affected the cyclist in many ways.	2	2		2																					
1239	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1240	3	he wouldn�t know he would be faceing while rider or the road @MONTH1 be something bad might happen to his bike or one of his bike�s wheels or he might fall of his the bick he would set so tired that he can�t go any more he might give it up	1	1		1																					
1244	3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn�t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.�� You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them.	3	2		3																					
1249	3	The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. �Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� Once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didn�t because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadn�t been running out of water I don�t think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse.	3	2		3																					
1250	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason I say this is because he ran out of water and he could dehidrate. Also looking for water slowed him dsown more. Another reason I say this is because the man gave him the wrong directions, which got him lost and confused. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1254	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert and heat with no water cause him to get dehydrated. The rolling hills and rough terrain tire him out. In the story it says �and growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This shows that the heat and terrain could cause him to over heat and live a heat stroke.	1	1		1																					
1256	3	Features of the setling affected the cyclist were the harsh & hot climate and terrain. The author clearly wrote how �the sun was beating down on him and how he almost died from dehydration.	1	1		1																					
1257	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. If the road is rough you have to have the right bike. Then if you get a flat tire you have to know to look out for dangerous and posionous things. If you were in a real bad accident you�d have to be prepared just in case they don�t find you in time. You would have to know what nights were like. For example, if it got real cold at night you need to keep youself warm.	1	1		1																					
1258	3	The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot and going up those hills had to be hard. The road was also very rough. It says, �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� It also says, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1259	3	"The cyclist�s condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat crippiled him or he traveled in search of Yosemite. He became lost and ran out of water making his situation worse. Being lost in seemingly the middle of nowhere in the hot heat he became exausted, dehydrated and fearing heat stroke and loss of consicencess. This is shown in the essay by, ""the growing realization that could drop from heatstroke"" And, ""It looked like i was going to lose concisness for the last time."	1	2		2																					
1263	3	"In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist. Certain features portray that this �journey� to Yosemite National Park was dreadful, but at the same time enjoyable. ""I would come to along this breeze jaunt."" The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more. �A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling.� This shows the dirtyness of the water. Also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive. It says �working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.� @CAPS1, the features portray sacrifice and bravely of the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1267	3	"During the cyclist journey in �Rough Road Ahead� by joe Kurmaskie he expierences setting changes such as the road being flat then going to short rolling hills. When hes wrideing he says the road is flat. �Flat road was replaced"" This tells us the road he was on was nice and flat. Then as hes rideing he notice the land change.� Flat road was replaced by, short rolling hills.� this tells us that the cyclist will have more trouble sence the terrain changed. That�s how the land changes  "	1	1		1																					
1270	3	The features of the surrounding setting affect the cyclist from hi/her performance for example, In the essay �Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted SPeed Limit� the setting is full of hills, twisting, rising and desending. All of these things are working against the energy that the cyclist has. Also, the lack of the people in towns give the cyclist a hard and depriving time on finding a water supply so he/she does not dehydrate. Third the weather in the essay has a great deal of being affected on the cyclist it is hot in the desert of California and the cyclist has to be very hydrated to continue on his bike ride.  	2	2		2																					
1275	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist is confronted with a troubling setting on his journy to Yosemite. He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This setting is a major setback to the cyclist�s journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best outof it. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perserverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey.	3	3		3																					
1276	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the roads are bumpy. The other things that is effecting the cyclist is the water on the roads. There are a lot of curved roads which always slows down his speed.	1	1		1																					
1279	3	The fatures of the setting affected the cyclist by it hard for him to control hill bike down on rough road, hotter making him thisty and running out of water. Also there wasnt an building in sight so he could get anything to drink. Also he did know where he was go. These are the features that affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1281	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because �never accept travel advice from	1	1		1																					
1283	3	"In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert make him need alot of water resources. This is because the heat and exercise will dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he is desperate enough to try to drink out of an old pump that had black sludge in it. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.  "	1	1		1																					
1284	3	While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite. �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� The cyclist continued on his spirits as well as her water supply going down. The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building. ��telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine.� @CAPS1 many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones. ��slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� @CAPS2 the cyclist found a deserted building, he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist found open store with modern bathrooms, he had �an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1, kiss them, and buy some bait.� At the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map.	2	3		3																					
1285	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere. First off the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about. Seccondly on his trip, he came accrossed an �Ghost town� with nothing in sight but a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water, the only water he	2	2		2																					
1287	3	In the passage �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� there are many features from the setting that affected the cyclist. One feature that affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way, for example in the text it says �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�, �I cased post, tyring to keep my balance in my dehydrated state� This proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by giving him a point to stay calm even in the state he was in being dehydrated and all the affects he encountered from that.	1	1		1																					
1288	3	There is many things that could have made his bycicle ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasn�t in the middle of no where and if he actually knew where he was. For example, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� There, he had almost no water to get him through the day. For instance, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him. In conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard.	2	2		2																					
1291	3	The feature of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, �over one long crippling hill, a building came into view� This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.� This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn�t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don�t make a life-threating choice.	3	2		3																					
1292	3	When the cyclist is at his low point, he is an abandoned ghost town, looking for water that tastes like battery acid. The cyclist feels hopeless in the abandoned town. When he first reaches the water pump and the abandoned juice building he has a little hope only to be let down, because the building has no juice and the water pump�s water is too hot and the water is not any good. The setting is the reason his mood changes through out the story.	1	2		2																					
1293	3	I am going to write a response that explains how the features of the setting affects the cyclist. In my response, I will include examples from the essay that support my conclusion. I think the features in the setting affect the cyclist because different things such as snow or rocks could affect the way someone rides.	0	0		0																					
1294	3	In the begining of the story, a young cyclist sets out on a long journy to Yosemite national park. Along  his ride he meets some old but confident men. They tell him a new rout wich �was to slice away hours� from his ride the setting was excedingly hot @DATE1. He was supposed to encounter a few thriving towns along the way the first was a �baren ghost town� the next had water �the flavor of battery acid, then he came to an abanded welches grape juice factory. The author navigated through a very trying setting until he reached a baite shop. The advice that he gives to his readers is to stick to your guns & don�t let old timers try and change your mind.	3	2		3																					
1296	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him thirsty and him thinking he is lost and going to die. The cyclist got information from an old guy that has not been off his porch for years. Just when the cyclist thought he was lost he saw �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp-if you want bait for the big ones, were your best bet!� The cyclist went in and got water, and the old man asked him if he wanted to know where to go, but this time he said no.	2	2		2																					
1297	3	"In the short story �Do not exeed the speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has great impact on the cyclist. In the begining of the story he describes the scenery as ""@CAPS1"". As he continued following the old mens out dated advice. It lead  him through more barren lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was �One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic� he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head"" he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called ""@PERSON2 and wilbers�s fish camp. ""This is where he drunk water and became repleshed. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist. Because depending on the location, decided weather he would live or die in the hot deserts of California."	2	2		2																					
1299	3	In the story,� Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� written by the @CAPS1, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, �Flat roads was replaced by short, riding hills �@CAPS2 as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and care free and the land had no hills and he flat. However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure� tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me.� The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.    	3	3		3																					
1301	3	In the book �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting was in codi, California. The author went on a journey	1	1		1																					
1302	3	Throughout the riders long journey the setting greatly affected him. For example, the hot weather caused him to drink the majority of water suply making him dehydrated and tired. If the weather was cool he would have lasted much longer.	1	1		1																					
1303	3	"In this story the cyclest was affected physically and emotionally in many ways. One such way was the setting around him. For example, when he rode into the first town he gained of boost of confidence because he believed that he was on the right track to Yosemite. Then when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows how hopeless the man fealt. when he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp"" he was relieved and thankfull because he no longer had death blazing towands him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and empty water bottle. This was how the the features and setting affects him in many ways."	3	2		3																					
1304	3	Riding through beastly mountains, hot and burning deserts and no water. A cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions. The two old men gave him the wrong directions and send him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through. First he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion. Maps are made for people to use so if you have a map you should trust it and in the ending it shows that the cyclist learned that because he said �And I promised myself right then that I�d always stick to it in the future.�	3	3		3																					
1310	3	"The setting in �Do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake �a ridiculously large"" snake � it realy didn�t look like a diamondback � blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me �(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways."	2	2		2																					
1311	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. @CAPS1 are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels,""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"" are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds."" A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" @CAPS1 are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story.   "	2	2		2																					
1312	3	The fetures in the settings like hills, make the cycleist use more energy, the more enegy that he uses the more water he will whant to drink. This is difficult because he states �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips�. Therefore he was in trouble.	2	2		2																					
1313	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he is in the desert and it is very hot outside. Also he is running out of water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because he�s pretty much dehydrated. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water. In conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way.	2	2		2																					
1314	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist�s mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old men�s knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps�with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.� The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn�t care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best.	3	3		3																					
1315	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit while riding his bike the author Joe Kurmaskie has alongride. Where he is riding there is up and down hills also the road is very rough. He was running out of water in the desert. �I stopped at a rusted water pump to get water and a tar like substance oozed out.� @CAPS1 that he is off his bike he least worrie about the posionous snakes of the desert. He founded Welch�s grape juice factory but it was abandoned. The author found a bait shop and got water	2	2		2																					
1316	3	In the short story �Do not @CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. In the story the cyclist experiences many changes in temperature and climate. He also experiences changes in land structure which makes it extremely hard to pedal and get where he needs to. From my reasoning is why the setting @MONTH1 affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1317	3	The hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination. The sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination. �The sun was begining to beat down...wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.� By him being so hot and tired fromthe sun, he thought that he would die from dehydration. This would very likely stop him from making it to his destination, Yosemite. His lack of water supply didn�t help the situation either because he could only go @NUM1, was �water depleting @NUM2.�	2	1		2																					
1318	3	The features  of the   setting   does   affect the cyclist. For example, if it is hot outside then he would need more water than normal. Also if it was raining he would have to drive more careful. That is why the setting would affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1320	3	"The features of the setting stronger, effect the cyclist's journey to Yosemite. The features of the land;in, and hills, the fact that it is desert, and the setting in the middle of june also effect this story.The dry and hills land is a huge factor for the main character. Because if is hilly, he has to work twice as hard. The land is dry, so he his thirsty and has no where to get anything to drink.The land is also desert, so there is no where he can go for help or to get food, water, or civilization. He believes that he is not going to make it. The text explains in paragraph !!, "" the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a goregous day on June simply because i listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh"" The setting plays a huge role in the story. It is hot, dry, and deserted this out effects the main character and journey."	3	3		3																					
1321	3	The cyclist in the essay Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit feels discouraged and dehydration because of the setting. Near the beginning, after viewing the first stop which consisted of a few broke buildings and some rusted pumps he states �This sight was troubleing,� He also feels dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds the produce �A tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water�. Also as he is pedaling he sees a sign that says do not exceed 55 miles per hour. He	3	3		3																					
1322	3	In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions  of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels, � The  sun was beginning to beat down , � (Kurmaskie) .He is starting to get tired �because � it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June �. (Kurmaskie).Not only is he very tired and hot not where he is riding is barron and open and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. Through the passage you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cycler can change how and why how he does. 	2	2		2																					
1326	3	The setting of a situation can affect a person both mentally and physically. This is evident in @PERSON1 �Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit.� The cyclist is unaffected, for the most part until the directions he was given by �a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� takes him over terrain not suitable for biking. Prior to following the men�s directions, the setting was enjoyable a made for an easy ride a reader knows this because the cyclist is confident. For example, he says �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of yosemite had my name written all over them.� This confidence begins to depleat as the cycling gets harder. For example, the cyclist says �sometimes life can feel so cruel.� after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit. The cyclist became disappointed and wanted to give up because he couldn�t even reach that limit. However, he�s determined and pushes through to reach a shop. This gives a sense of satisfaction and confidence. So in conclusion setting can have a powerful affect on mood or motivation.	3	2		3																					
1327	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him ???  are ??? like when he rood through that ghost town. The setting is a big part of this story thats all that talk about. And when hes getting water or how the tumbleweeds are crossing the road. He was all ways thirsty and rode his bike along ways and is no paint in ??? ??? ???.	2	2		2																					
1328	3	How the setting changes the mood of the cyclist is that what he sees pretty much discribes how he feels. Like he starts off with strong less and a smile on his face. Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town, that didn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it he laughs. Also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old men's direction giving. Like at the first town he still has confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that it starting to get hotter but that doesn�t change his mood much. @NUM1 miles later comes top a fork in road with rusty water pumps and a ran down car all that makes him less confidence in water level. Then he realizes the next town is a long way away so he losse more confidence and gets more worried about water. Then the flat road is replaced with rough road so his mood goes down more. Then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up. Here is how the setting affected his mood.	2	3		3																					
1330	3	In the short story, �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The cyclist experiences some difficult times. When starting the journey he had very little water. Because it was hot and dry his water went quickly leaving him very little water for the rest of the trip. The ragh roads also made him, tired making it harder to make the journey.	1	1		1																					
1331	3	Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are �the cool pines and rushing rivers� they affect the cyclist by keeping him cool and energized by the senery and the temperature, another is the juice factory and it was old and shut down showing that he would die alone. The goast town which was completely and utterly desserted showing that the place is barren and unlivible these are some of the features the affect the biker.	2	1		2																					
1332	3	The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In �Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says �Over one long, crppling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1333	3	Heat, dessert, humidity � all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey. First, heat because the heat is making him thirsty for water @CAPS1 he is running row on. For example, the narrator describes, �� water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips.� This means that the day is hot and running out of water. Second, dessert because the narrator is the only one around and deserts are usually diserted. For example the narrator exclaims �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind.� @CAPS1 clearly states that he could be in a dessert where no one wants to be. Lastly, humidity, because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seen hotter than it usually is. This is why heat, dessert, and humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as he is on a journey.	2	2		2																					
1335	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn�t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1�. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn�t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber�s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who �haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting.	1	1		1																					
1337	3	The features in the setting affect cyclist in many ways. One of which is bring only to carry so much equipment which @MONTH1 be needed. For example, you can only take so much water with you and once you run out of there are no buildings or anything around that you are out of luck. Also, you can only take so much food. Finally, when you are ready to go to sleep you can�t just pull over you have to ride until you find a hotel or get home. I know that I would not make it. So those are just a few reasons on why the setting affects cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1339	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him in a way because he wouldn�t have to use strength and pedal as hard without having as much water in his body. When he came to a pump, it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid. The dryness of the dessert had a bad affect on the cyclist because he wasn�t able to get to the Yosemite water until the end. The breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down. The features of the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1340	3	Many things that involve settings can affect other things. In the �Do not exceed the posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National park. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day�.� (kurmaskie @NUM1). The sertting from the day is affecting him very much and it is hard for him to continue. He is very tired and almost sick from the heat. The settings of this place are hurting to the cycleist and he wants to go home and away from the heat. The setting of this place effects the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
1344	3	One part of the setting that is affecting him is the sun, which is mercilessly overheating the biker. Another problem is the terrain he is on, which is a number of small hills is wearing him out. There are also apparently no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool him off.	1	1		1																					
1346	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the conditions of the road and weather. he hit some bad and nasty water. along with other hazardous things, he also tried to ride through a desert where he had already drank all his bottles of water and had nothing left to drink, he was very dehydrated and had to drink nesles water. It was hard for him to keep going, being dehydrated so bad but he had to. at one point a big snake almost took up the entire road and he had to just ease his way on by it, his riding conditions were so bad, he thought he was going to die, he said the birds were going to eat him. The weather was so hot it was hard to go on, he finally found a bathroom, went inside it drank water from the sink and yellced to a man that told him the direction he wanted	2	2		2																					
1348	3	The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. How because there was not a posted speed limit up there cause the cyclist went right throw and over goin faster then he was suppored to.	1	1		1																					
1351	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was very hot. �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heartsroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		3																					
1352	3	There are many features of the setting that would affect the pedalists. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills �(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows the change of terrain. Hills must be traveled up to get to the other side and that takes much time and eneegy, especially for bike riders. �high deserats of California in June �(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows heat. Heat makes it harder for most people to concentrate and causes people to heat overheated when exerting much force at once. These two co	2	2		2																					
1353	3	The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the rode. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future. So he�s keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future.	1	1		1																					
1356	3	The terrain the cyclist faces don�t help very mach considering he is almost out of water, he came across hills that ticed himout a lot & made him even more thirsty. Also, when we came across the juice factory he used a lot of energy to get there because he was excited and that made him even more thirsty. Therefore if he didn�t have any energy left after all of that he wouldn�t have been able to get to the baits shop.	2	2		2																					
1357	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all he is in the middle of no where, and he doesn�t know the direction of where he is going, and he also doesn�t know the people who live there. The other thing is that he doesn�t have a food, or a drink, so without eating or drinking he can�t get energy, so he can�t ride the bike.	1	1		1																					
1359	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered.	2	2		2																					
1360	3	The feature in the setting affeted the cyclist alot. It was a hot summer day and he was running out of water. With oll the heat he could have had a heat stroke. Another problem was the hills. He didn't have alot of energy, ?? the sun were tiding it from him.	1	1		1																					
1362	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as he gets closer to the nearest town  the ground becomes rougher to ride on. Like when he sees the sign saying not to exceed the limit. That shows that the ground is going to be rough.	1	1		1																					
1363	3	The features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead� negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable.� When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid.� @CAPS1 feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly.� I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� He worned about heatstroke and his bodys need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed  and was not traveled often by people � crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.� As you can see, the cyclist was negatively afftected by the features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead.�	3	3		3																					
1365	3	In the story the cyclist faces many issues that could stop him from not finishing his journey. First, his water supply could cause him to become dehydrated and he could pass out. Another issue is the hot weather in June, which could cause him to a heat stroke and literally die. The rough terrain could stop him from finishing the trip because he could pop a bike tire and would have to walk. The cyclist faces many problems that could end his trip and maybe even life, but pushs through and survives.	1	1		1																					
1369	3	Some feature on the setting that @MONTH1 have affected the cyclist was the fact that he was running out of water and when he pumped water he said he pumped with all his strenght at first a tar like substance oozed out follwed by brackish water he said the water tasted of battery acid. Also in this setting the cyclist notices a terrain change flat road then turned short hills , follwed by a snake that looked od a diamond back.	1	1		1																					
1370	3	In the essay �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� By Joe Kurmaskie. The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was on a bike and it was hot he ran into bumpy roads, and hills. For example he says �Not June miles into the next section of the road. He noticed the terrains changing. Flat land was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 example is �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that he could die from heatstroke.� These examples show that it was not easy and how the features affected the cyclist. In conclusion this story shows that you should never take directions from a old person, exspecially if its hot and you are riding a bike.	1	1		1																					
1373	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist�s attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old mens directions he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delicious, the setting had added severly to the problem. The beating sun and high desserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he come to a rusted water pump �black tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions.	3	2		3

1382	3	In the story, The man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. He faces many obsticales in the story. For example, he has gone about @NUM1 miles without water. Also, their are a lot of hills and turns withen the story which slow him down He is having a hard time getting to water because of many obsticals	1	1		1																					
1385	3	The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he�s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, �I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn�t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, �yes- sir: I own a very good map.� @CAPS2 by this he�s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he�ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed.	3	2		3																					
1389	3	Some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replace by short, rolling hills. Then he came to a rough road. Another obstacle from the cyclist was the tar-like substance that came out the rusted water pump followed by brackish water feeling somewhere of @NUM1 hundred degrees. Everytime he pumped it wouldn�t cool down and the water tasted like battery acid. He was hitting his water bottle regularly that is why he needed new water. The cyclist was travelling through the high deserts of California and the sun was starting to beat down so he was dehydrated. The snake blocked the pavement in front of him that looked like diamond back.  	2	2		2																					
1390	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The getting of the story is, �a reservoir campground outside of @CAPS1, California� during the early summer. Being the early summer in souther California, the temperatures are going to be hot. And the main character, who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity, is a going to sweat a lots. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water. The water runs out and we are now it our conflict. The setting also reads the main character to his resolution of the conflict. Being by a reserveir, fishing is going to be a popular activity. A bait and tackle shop would be the perfect business to have, since there who is at bait and tackle shop, the cyclist could go inside a quinch his thirst. Therefore, the setting of the story affect affects the conflict and the solution.	3	3		3																					
1393	3	The wether can change the corse of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold out side then the cyclist will bring beveyer cloths if its. Hoter out side he would most likly bring lighter clothes. If he was riding farther hed bring more supplys like water and food If he was going on a short rid then he wouldn�t bring so much stuff. The way the wether is changes the way a person will prepaire,	1	1		1																					
1394	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the different aspects of the setting effect the cyclist in several ways. When he first begins he doesn�t even notice how hot it is and he says, �the ran was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� His mood starts to change very quickly. Soon he drinks most of his water of becomes increasingly tired. He finds a water pump which irriates him when he realize the water tastes like �battery acid.� As he continues he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamond back so he slowly goes by out. When he notices a factory he uses his last bit of energy to reach it only to be discouraged when he finds it abandone. His spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water.	2	2		2																					
1395	3	Multiple parts of the setting effect the cyclist; When he arrives in a town with a water pump, but this pump doesn�t have good water, �when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This part of terrain shows its effect. When he becomes very dehydrated, �in my dehydrated state� (kurmaskie @NUM1). Another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him.	2	2		2																					
1396	3	The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the setting. He was riding in a desert which is very hot, with little civilization to help him. Also the rode that was driving on was not very smooth which gave him troubles. The wildlife also had an impact on him. He once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around. Also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off. The desert itself was what really got to hm. Deserts don�t have much water which is what he needed and he couldn�t find a town to stop at, at least one with some people any way. So the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him.	2	2		2																					
1399	3	Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure riding a bike might be easy, but being a cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclist have many obsticles to over come while riding. One obstacle would be a rough terrain. Cyclist are used to riding on smooth, paved roads. Going off � road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge. In the short story �Do Exceed posted Speed Limit�, by Joe Kurmaskie also has another example for an obsticle cyclist have to be careful of, and that is running out of water, �I eased past, trying to keep by balance in my dehydrated state� (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is important when riding a bike. In conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead.	2	2		2																					
1400	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert- like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake . blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me� (Kurmaskie, @NUM1).The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death. They remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. Were the snake in the path to poison him he�d not only under the beaty sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber�s fish camp, the hope is restored back to him. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive. In the end, the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him.	3	3		3																					
1401	3	"The feateres of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example ""not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. ""This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modem bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber� This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now hapy to have water and have reached his destination."	2	2		2																					
1402	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he saw �short, rolling hills,� tumbleweeds� and �a ridiculously large shake,� and he thought that he was not getting anywhere.	1	1		1																					
1404	3	The rider was affected by two men giving him wrong directions. The rider followed their advice instead of taking the right way he ended up taking the long way. He was getting very thribiy. He also came face to face with a snake. Then he finally found the nearest town in got help.	1	1		1																					
1406	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They affected his confidence, his energy, and his determination. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident. This is show when he says.� The cool pined and rushing rivers of yosemite has my name written all over them. This shows confidence because he knows he can make it to yosemite.When he runs out of water he begins to lose confidence and thinks he way die. Since he ran out of water because of the heat, his energy is also dropped. You know he�s running out of water when he says.�The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, after lose of water and confidence; he actually had higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive. As you can see the cyclist was affected in many ways by the features of the setting.	3	2		3																					
1407	3	Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example in the oldmen that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever. Another example is: the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in @DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved	2	2		2																					
1408	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speeed limit,� the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story it says �The sun was beginning to beat down. �This quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This means that the cyclist is cold not only going to have to deal with the heat, but he is also going to have to side-over hill after hill. Eventhough they @MONTH1 be small, rolling hills, it still takes alot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is �I got down on my hands and knes, walking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out, followed  by brackish water feling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees �this quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water, that he uses his small amount of strength left to try and get some water. When he finally does get some water, it first come out as an ooey substance then the water come out really hot. In conclusion, these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting. 	2	3		3																					
1413	3	The setting of the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limit� affected the cyclest greatly. He was riding through a desert in June. This meant that the temperature was very high. The narrator even states �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� @CAPS1 feature of the setting that affected him were the hills. He even calls them	1	1		1																					
1414	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because he knows he�s in the wrong area. The cyclist understand's that he should have never took that advice from them old men. So he was upset and new he should have taken his advise. The cyclist had a feeling that he wasn�t supposed to take it that way he said he shouldn�t have let them take a peek at his map. So the features really affect him.	1	1		1																					
1415	3	In �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie the main character faces a lot of trouble. First people give him the wrong directions. But, worst of all he has to travel a lot of mile on a bike through extreme temperatures. Going up and down hills and pedaling really hard. He doesn�t even have any cool water. As the character says, ��followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (kurmaskie @NUM1). That kind of water didn�t help him either. It didn�t quench his thirst because it was so hot, he said it tasted like battery acid. But, finally he worked up his confidence and kept pedalig till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool water. Then he headed off to Yosemite and didn�t take anyone�s advice.	3	2		3																					
1418	3	The cyclist was motivated to get the job done. When they   said only �    eighteen miles down the road.� He thought it was going to be forever but he made it because he �conserved his water ...� and last kept on going, when the road   turned into a rocky gravel road, he still kept on going, but it was harder on his legs and water supply.	1	1		1																					
1419	3	The condition the cyclist are in calls for a lot of preparation. The cyclist was in a hot desert area with winding road and hills. The cyclist need to have plenty of water to make it where he is going, and, as read in the story, the conditions almost caused @CAPS1 health to the man who was trying to ride through.	1	1		1																					
1420	3	Setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� really determines how the story turns out. The setting was in deserted areas, the desert, and even roadways. In the desert, there is no water making the cyclist become dehydrated. without water, he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits was extremly high fifty-five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing  � a water-depleting @NUM1.� When he finds areas that are abandoned, these are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like �battery acid.� Setting can affect alot in the story. Without this setting, the story would be alot different than it is now.	3	2		3																					
1421	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had a couple of problems turning his journey little, amount of water, tough roads, including there were no cars on the road either. It all caused a lot of difficulty for the cyclist like on page @NUM1 paragraph one the first sentence �It didn�t really matter. In was going to die and the birds would pick me down� The elements were so tough on the cyclist that he or she was going to going to give hope. But luckly in the end the cyclist found a place to stop and get water with directions.	1	2		2																					
1422	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is trying to get water but when he tried the pump, �a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�. The cyclist doesn�t have any water so it is difficult to go on. He could suffer from heat exhaustion. As he came to the next town, he found, �the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant�. He is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1423	3	In the story there were many features of the setting tha affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is.   	2	2		2																					
1425	3	The setting of this short story affects the cyclist by making him dehydrated and dies. Also in the setting he found the abandon factory which makes him feel hopeless. If the setting was elsewhere then this setting he would have felt different as he didn�t  meet the people  of the reserve he could have been in the better roads than the old roads he was in	1	1		1																					
1429	3	"The features of the setting extremely affect the adjust in the ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the adjust the out of water but on top of that by faced, rolling wills, makes and hard road condition all of these setting played a huge will in the cyclist puformance, ""it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills."" He also says ""tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me. These setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride. He ran out of water no it was hard to reduce up will and the night of a deadly snake made the adjust named and worked to the difficulty of pufornenance for the cyclist"	2	3		3																					
1433	3	The   features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot of dry place and has no water. He is pedaling up hills and that makes him even more tired. The dude is probably dehydrated and   his  conditions   are getting worse!	1	1		1																					
1436	3	The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble. Because of the lack of water, not only might be die but he begins to see mirages. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isn�t good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic can�t help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, they�re landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
1442	3	The cyclist listen to the geogers. after a while he starts to get tired. After the seenery desert change he starts to get mad. He criticizes himself for accepting advice from �old-timers who haven�t left the	2	2		2																					
1443	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the �fork of sorts� as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn�t. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third ""obstacle"" he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still with a smile on his face."	3	3		3																					
1447	3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the tormils in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills the Welch factory, & finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a heven, @NUM1 safe ground that contains everything the men needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready & eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is wher the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as �the high deserts of California.� The sun is boiling down & water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder the chances of his survival lessons. When he crosses a snake, it suggest even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive & is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
1448	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is riding his bike along the road and encounters a dilema.�� @CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. Blocked the� pavement in front of me.� He had to stop and into by the snake which showed him down and freaked him out. He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that �really did look like a diamondback.� @CAPS2, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it�s a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles.� I�d read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.� * @CAPS3 he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on. This affected him because he @CAPS3 got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning. The features of 	3	2		3																					
1451	3	In the story the cyclist explains how the road goes from good to bad: An example,� Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit. Also the dry.	1	1		1																					
1452	3	"In the story, these are many elements that affected the cyclist in his journey.The first features of the setting that affects him is the old water pump, which did not work, and when it did the water from it lasted horrible. The next obstacles on his journey was rough terrain. ""Flat road  was replaced by short rolling hills,"" was how he described it. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be  abandoned. Eventually he finds a  town and rest after his long journey, and learns his lesson from before not to take advice from people he doesn�t know."	2	2		2																					
1454	3	'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrian changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills'' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficulty he become more ignorant and hopeless. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. it was a sad, hopeless laugh'' (@NUM1). He wasn't goig to die, die but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. ''Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timerd who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office'' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot raod, and he started taking stabs at the old men ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (@NUM4) The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back thos trip of only a few rough terrain, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless,angry, and he felt sorry for himself.	3	3		3																					
1455	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist is traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Another affect said in the story was that the cyclist made it to a town where the water pump was all rusted and with all his strength, he worked the handle and got a tarlike substance followed by brackish water which he couldn�t drink. Also , the cyclist had been hitting his water bottles regularly. Lastly, the old-timers said the towns would be close when really they were far apart.	2	2		2																					
1456	3	There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey. This cyclist seemed to have bad wick. He starts off mentioning that he is planning a trip to Yosemite and the men that hear this give him a tip. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions. He ends up getting lost. The cyclist is also travelling in the �high deserts of California in June.� That means that he is travelling in summer with dry air. When he gets to the first �town� he sees, he can it get the water he needs to rehydrate his body. He also runs into a snake while travelling through the desert, which slows him down. Because it�s hot, and he�s tired, he begins to see mirages that affect him. All of these features cause the cyclists to take one long, tiring journey through the desert. These features also taught him the lesson to not take advise from old men who have not left their porch because their information @MONTH1 be out of date.	2	2		2																					
1459	3	Hot, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink. He will get dehydrated. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structur of any kind. Finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road. So he had to move around it.	2	2		2																					
1460	3	Seting is one of the most important neds for a cyclist if the terrein or weather are bad, the hotter it is for a cylist its ?? ??	1	1		1																					
1461	3	The The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the cyclist @CAPS1 challenging porblem face by the author. Forexample, I nottice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had erected the first few things, a large highway. That�s shows when he arrived, the road does not good and also large highway high of jumped.	1	1		1																					
1463	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didn�t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found �several rusty pumps,� and �one ramshackle shed.� This probably didnt help him because he didn�t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn�t get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that �There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind� and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn�t setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story �Rough road ahead� the setting in the story didn�t help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didn�t help that he was in a desert.	3	3		3																					
1465	3	The features of the land affect the cyclist in the many ways. For example, the first two buildings that he came to were abandond so he could not get any food or water. Also, he noticed that the terrain was changing from flat to rolling hills and this will put more strain on his legs. Finally, the land was hot and dry wich was making him dehidrated. This is how the features of the land affected the cyclist. 	1	1		1																					
1466	3	In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink.	2	2		2																					
1467	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. Early in the essay, the syclist states he �enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers.� The cyclist was enjoying himself and the  atmosphere, but then the mood changed quickly to doubt when he didn't listen to the �collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office� and his depleting water source quickly became a cause for concern. Doubt was soon followed by @CAPS1 when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp and was able to get a drink from the bathroom foucets @CAPS1 was then followed by satisfaction when he �promised himself right then that he'd always stick to [the very good map] in the future.   	2	3		3																					
1468	3	The setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways. One reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author become dehydrated. Dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water. The setting also affected him by draining his confidence and making him seek out water. �I hung my head,� means that he was depressed. This proves that no matter who or what you follow there is always a possibility of death from any circumstances. Therefore this is how the author was affected by the setting he was biking @CAPS1.	2	2		2																					
1471	3	THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE �SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,� AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO EFFECT HIM A COUPLE OF WAYS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN �GHOST TOWNS� THAT CONSISTS OF �RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS� AND �SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS.� THESE FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL HOPELESSNESS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIN�T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED.  OBSTACLES SUCH AS �TUMBLEWEEDS� AND �PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES� ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVE ON THE �@NUM1 ROAD� ONLY DOING �12 MPH.� ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON.  THE OBSTACLE BEING A �LONG CROPPING HILL,� THIS MADE THE CYCLIST EXHAUSTED, AS HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL, HE WAS ??? ???? ??? ???	3	2		3																					
1473	3	The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. �Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�. After reading this information and the descriptions. I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadn�t taken the �shortcut� that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author.	2	3		3																					
1474	3	"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welch�s Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, �with all my strength.� @CAPS1 he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because �it had the flavor of battery acid.� Next, the Welch�s Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of �a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice�, made him feel worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, all refreshments in the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am alergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2�s peanut shade. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and ""drank deeply from the sinle.� He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sush : bar, and sush: is my favorite food."	3	3		3																					
1477	3	The cyclist is most affected by e heat. He is exerting all his energy and will to get to Yosemite. The hot sun and lack of water makes him very tired and causes him to use his energy inefficiently. At one point, he has to make sure the building is a mirage. It is so hot his mind could be playing tricks on him.	1	1		1																					
1479	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because sometimes, it made him lose some courage and optimism. �and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day� This is an example of how he lost courage. I wanted to be brave and be strong. But the hot day and all the sweat made the author feel weak. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear� This is an example of how the author lost some optimism. He didn�t want to die, but he kept telling himself that he was going to , he should have thought to himself that he was going it make it, but the setting was just to rough. There were bumps along his ride, and the sun beating down his thirst, he became less courageous and less optimistic.	2	2		2																					
1480	3	The features of his journey are cruel. �Rolling hills,� make him work harder to get over them. The more he works, the more he sweats and therefore he needs fluids to do so. The lack of water he has does not help. Poisonous don�t really bother him if he leaves alone. The condition of the roads adds on to the hills. Rough roads make him work hard to get through and then over the hills. So this guy is getting it pretty rough.	2	1		2																					
1482	3	Throughout �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through a very dry area, where it was very hot, dry and dangerous. There was no water to be found and the terrain is were rough and bumpy. The speaker stated, �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously lareg snake...�  (Kurmaskie @NUM1).The cyclist fared land blockings and dangerous animals. This cause him to slow down a little bit. It was extremely not out in the setting he was in. The cyclist was in the deserts of California in June.The speaker stated, �@CAPS1 rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on gorgeous day in June...� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expirencing the high temperatures of the setting. The cyclist witnessed the intense  features of the setting.	2	2		2																					
1484	3	The features of the setting started out easy like a road thats flat cool lines to keep him cool and not hot. Then it sat harder lack of water road is not flat anymore snakes the cool pines are gone. 	1	1		1																					
1485	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "	3	2		3																					
1487	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated, getting tired, and by getting lost. After the cyclist was on the road for a while he had drank almost all of his water, but he still had a while to go before he got to his destination. He was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around. He also got tired because he was out in the sun, had barley any water, and he didn�t know where he was going. One last example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people. So if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired and getting lost were the features of the setting affect the cyclist had.	2	2		2																					
1488	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he runs out of water because he is trying to traverse the terrain. In the setting there is a desert in California that he is riding through on a bike, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California� The word ""high"" means that there were hills which would make the journey even more difficult. The hills appeared later in the story as the cyclist said �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� When the speaker says replaced he is trying to show a change of terrain. another feature of the setting is the tumbleweed that he crosses other hills, �tumbleweeds crossed in path.� The tumbleweeds made him remember he was in the desert because tumbleweeds are associated with the desert which brought up the thought & dying and being picked apart by birds."	2	2		2																					
1490	3	If it is hot Out you can dehydrate quickley. also, if is ff ong hand hilly you use a lot of energy. It can berough on equipment, body, and mind. Make sure you dress apropreit lyand carry lot so f water. Next, make sure your tiresa inflated and all equip is working properly. then, plan a good route that you can stopat places and catch a breath or some water. also, make sure you eat well, food provides a lot of energy.	2	2		2																					
1492	3	"In the story the cyclist was affected. The cyclist was affected by the directions of the old man. It sas that they gave it to him to help him out. That it was a shortcut. I think the cyclsit thinks the directions are out of date. The reason think this is that in the second sentence of the story it says, ""never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the continues of their porches since carter was in office."" The feature of the setting also affected him because he had to ride upand down through what he though of as it, rough terrain. That is what I think affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1494	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him is the towns were old and deserted. In the story he said �This place might have been a thriving little spot� but @CAPS1 it was a ghost town.� He could not get any water or any directions. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because the roads were bumby and there were many hills. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 the cyclist had to use all his power to manuever over the hills. The third reason why the setting affected the cyclist was the weather and that it was a desert. �I was traveling through the deserts of California in June.� He was hot, sweaty and thirsty. He was also tired and desperate to find water and town that was not deserted. The features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by the roads, deserted towns and the lack of water.	2	2		2																					
1499	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negitvly because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no stones too get a drink at, For example he says �There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind's. This explains how his setting affected him because he had no where to go or get a drink. That is my reason why the cyclist settings where negitve.	1	1		1																					
1500	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in bad ways. The rocky road and steep hills made him peddle harder. The old people made him go through the rocky way. The temperature from the desert made him thirsty so he ran out of water fast, He said �When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� The heat could have killed him anytime. For example �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This ride this man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous ride.  	2	2		2																					
1501	3	"The settnig can greatly effect the cyclist. The palce can change what happens and how it happens. For example if the story had taken place in alaska the cyclist would not have had, ""Wide rings of sweat circling my shirt."" and instead have been fighting off hypo thermia. The setting is very important because it affects all of the details in the writing. "	2	2		2																					
1502	3	At first the terrain was fine and he confident. But when he reached the first town it looked like one of those ghoust towns in the movies. The next town didnt come up when he was told it would. The terrain was that of a desert no water for miles. But he stayed determind. And he made it to some water though.	1	1		1																					
1505	3	Pride, determination, relief � all are things that the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. First the cyclist started of rideing on fresh legs and good directions, but after a while down the road he started to dought the old men, �a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their been a sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it.� After feeling that the direction might be rough, he rode out of pride to get to his destination. Next the rider had great determination to get to his destination and did many things, �I gathered � a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst.� This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going. Finally the cyclist was fatigue when he arrived at the @CAPS1 shop because he then knew the old men were right and would reach his destination, �As I stumbled into rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink this quote shows he was polite naturally to get water but to know the men were right.	2	3		3																					
1507	3	I work better when I can feel the  environment.  I think  the some goes  for  cycling  in  the  mountain , fresh air and no worries  on  you  mind them  cycling can become fun like the climates into the easy he even the fresh air,  the fine trees and the environment  makes him feel  better  so for cyclist environment plays a vital role.	1	1		1																					
1508	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. The setting affected the cyclist performance. For example, the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened for instance, the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of. Again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. For example, the river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water. In conclusion, the setting had a major affect on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1511	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,'' the cyclist is affected doth emotionally and physically by the features of the setting. At the start, when he came to a deserted shed with rusty pumps, he began to feel discouraged. �[The] sight was troubling,�(page @NUM1) @CAPS1 on in the essay, the terrain changes from flat land to short, rolling hills and tumbleweeds began to pass. The cyclist is definitely affected by the change in terrain. He is now exhaugnted but continues to pump his legs and ride on. Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting how includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost detected by this. �I hung my head'' (page @NUM2) he confessed. In the end, once he finds an old fishermans store, he is relieved seeing the store from a distance excited the author, because, he could finally have a drink. The author mood and body were greatly affected by that features of the setting.	3	2		3																					
1513	3	The main affect is the lack of water. It is in June, while riding his bike in California. Therefore it�s going to be very hot and he�ll need a lot of water t stay hydrated. When he sees that Welch�s Grape Juice factory, it just makes him think of his thirst even more. Also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest. He starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain. This doesn�t help his dehydration. That�s why you should always carry a lot of water with you if you�re riding a bike during the summer	2	2		2																					
1515	3	In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� a cyclist is going against heat lack of water and rough hills trying to maneuver around.	1	1		1																					
1516	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is tRying to bike up hills and down hills, which can be very tiRing. Also, the hot aiR can dehydRate him, which can cause him to pass out. Along with the dRy aiR, theRe is dRy land, which means theRe is no place to stop foR wateR oR take a @CAPS1. The Rough @CAPS2 make the biking naRaeR because it involves moRe eneRgy than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the  middle of the Road made it haved foR the bikeR to go aRound. If the snake would have bitten him he could have died fRom poison.	2	2		2																					
1517	3	"The setting in the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very hot in dry, very little shade or moisture, at some point maybe even none at all. This whether affected the author because he had no water at all so he was getting more dehydrated the further he went."	1	1		1																					
1519	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting of the terrain was hot and water draining. In the text it says �Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees� this proves that the cyclist is exagerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says �I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.� This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out. In conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best. 	2	2		2																					
1520	3	"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, �Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view�. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. Also it says in the story �I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."	3	3		3																					
1524	3	A cyclist can only travel as fast as slow as he pedals. If the setting is a humid sunny day he can�t go to fast due to his lung capacity. If it is a warm but windy day he has to wath his speed to keep from getting hurt. Basically unless the weather is nice or safe enough he will go fast. But his safty care first so it depend on the weather mostly but also the time of the day. If it is night [dark] the reflectors must be put on to keep from getting it.	1	1		1																					
1525	3	The features in the setting affecting the cyclist because of the heat and the terrain. I say this because in the story it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down with the herendous heat beating down on him. The heat also makes it hard because it makes you drink more and throughout the story he was trying to find some water, and the water he did find was about �two hundred degrees and tasted like a battery acid.� If you have no water that makes it very hard to bicycle that far of a distance in that much heat.	1	1		1																					
1531	3	The cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all. he was in the desert in june very hot day and every town he had come to was abandoned and had no water. It was also very hilly which made the work even harder. 	3	2		3																					
1533	3	The cyclist �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was definatly affected by the setting. He was cycling in California - which is a hot place to begin with - in June - which made it even hotter coming upon a hot desert. When you�re doing a physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get hot and he was out of water. This affected his body by making him tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself. Then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice. He said �In an ironic twist abandon years earlier had been a Welch�s grape juice factory and bottling plant.� He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant. The cyclist was definatly affected by his surrondings both mental - by saying �I�m going to die.� - and physically by becoming dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
1534	3	The cyclist was riding in some rough, dry and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. He described it as, �In the high deserts of California in June.� It was dry, lifeless and hot The sun was beating on him and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out. The empty towns were what he was wanting on for fresh water, but they�d been very abandoned. This made his journey very dangerous. He could�ve fallen off at any time because of heat stroke He would�ve died right then and there. His sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. He had to enhance these extreme. Ironical conditions for miles on end, just to find some water. It was all that a desert is and all that a home shouldn�t go through.	2	3		3																					
1537	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist  greatly. The features is old abandon towns and hot temperatures. Also abandoned buildings. This makes the cyclist think All hope is lost. The essay says this �Over one long crippling hill, a bulding came into view [...] I hung my head that smoky blues tune ""summertime rattle around."" Then to a happy mo In an ironic twist that should please all sadist reading this, the building [...] by the looks  afit had been a welch�s  grape Juice factory and bottling plant [...] I hung my head that smoky bluees tune sumertime rattle around.� Then to a happy mood it states �As I stumbled into a ra ther modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, i had a overwhelming  urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.""  "	2	2		2																					
1539	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, �no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,� he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to �short, rolling hills�. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed �crippling�, My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience.	2	3		3																					
1540	3	Excitement, desperation, and self-pitty are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite park because of it peacefulness. He said, �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name.� He wanted to get their because it was so hot. He started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of this hot water hole. �I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid.� He was running out of water so he got desperate for some. He started to have self-pitty on his self,� sometimes life can be so cruel,� he was feeling pitty on himself because he had such a long way to go still. These are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting.	2	2		2																					
1541	3	"Features of the setting affect the cyclist�s moods in many ways. The story says. �About fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ""town.� ""The cyclist is probably allready tired from pedaling for fourty miles. Then he finds out that the town is desserted, which makes him a little frustrated. The next few stops are also desserted and he is almost out of water. He is becoming desperate. The road becomes bumpy and there is a large snake blocking the way. He is terrified. Finally, he reaches a bait shop with cool water ,and he is relieved. As you can see, the cyclist goes though many moods caused by the setting of the story."	2	2		2																					
1542	3	The way the feature of the setting affected the cyclist is that  its in June in the middle of the desert. Also he was given wrong	1	2		2																					
1543	3	The cyclist was affected by the climate, the people, and the surrounding. The climate was the desert in June which was very hot with little water. This made him dehydrated and miserable. The old men that �helped� him acused think to be in the guiding situation he was in. There were no surrounding shop or buildings that were inhabined. This way there was no place for him to get any water nouroushment.       	2	2		2																					
1544	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by when the story says �Twenty miles up the road. I came to a fork of sorts�, This statement from the story affected the cyclist because he didn�t know which way to go. Another feature that affected the setting is when the story says �I got on my hand and knees, Working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength�. That statement shows that the cyclist was dieing for water and he didn�t think any was going to come out. Last feature that affected the cyclist was when the story says �Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. This shows that the rider had to go under a speed limit but he was earlier tired and he was going way under it and that he could make it up the rough road.	2	3		3																					
1546	3	In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert which dehydrated him and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the  towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they don�t get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise.	2	3		3																					
1547	3	Because the setting of the cyclist ride is dry desert it makes the cyclist seem more and more determined. He's is going against the odds so it seems like hes pushing himself to the limit. Against the heat and the long road he's on and having no water all seems lost for the cyclist. But in the end he pulls himself together and makes it happen for himself and triumphs over adversity.	1	1		1																					
1551	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills. So far the cyclist had a great ride for about two miles into his journey after that it started to change. This is supported when the author states, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing� (kurmaskie). Even though the author started this journey out nice it did not take long for thing to change against him. Although the hills and road conditions changing the character in the story still gets through his problems with out much worries. With all of the problems in the setting the cyclist still comes through to end his journey.	1	2		2																					
1552	3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, run�down @ORGANIZATION1 factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is not and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads. He is running low on water and at the one town he finds the water from the pump is undrinkable. The features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason hid health is at risk.  	3	3		3																					
1554	3	In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and desserted. The description could suggest lonlieness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone and didn�t know where he was going, he still persisted. While he thought about �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� This thought kept him strong, so he kept trying.	1	1		1																					
1556	3	When the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself. He sees everything as the old men told him. As he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty. �There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The man started becoming very unsure. You could tell he says �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get excited.� He was very doubtful he�d get to where he was going. In the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water.  	2	2		2																					
1557	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story alot. Having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey the cyclist recieved bad information on how to get to his destonation which lead him on a long hard journey with not much water. He says in the story �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2�. This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. Another feature of the netting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse untill he reached a high way late in his journey. He said �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This means the faster, easy, to ride terrain was replaced by slower harder to ride on terrain. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe factal and affected the cyclist alot living this story. "	3	2		3																					
1560	3	The features of the setting of �Do not exceed posted speed limit� greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills. It makes it difficult for him to bike. He needs to use more energy to get over the hills. Another example is when it says �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair. Lastly, he sees the Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier. All of these things affect the cyclist. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned.	3	2		3																					
1561	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, �I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water �a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel�. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the �battery acid� tasting water. Also there was the Welch�s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. �A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head�. As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
1562	3	The author finds the desolate and harsh settings to be not discouraging, rather they stand out as a cause of amusement and fun, quest-like tests. The author writes that after arriving at his first ghost-town, he chuckles, amused by the funny �old codgers� and their crazy ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isn�t the least bit established anymore, he�s slightly disappointed, but sees it as �a test of [his] inner spirit.� At the third building an abandoned factory he still appreciates the irony of the situation. While biking across the desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and instead uses it as a point of reference to work his progress and as a way to push himself. Though the author is faced with empty disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing 	1	1		1																					
1563	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead: do not excess speed limit, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier, and as the cyclist travels and limits are being pushed his outlook is somewahat grim he only expects the worst. The rough road strats out after a water pump he finds gives him piping not, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor to his life, and is the source for him living. In the beginning he drank it regularly and when he gets to the pump it is bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself. The cyclist in this story is very a ware to how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration. At one point he says �and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porches in a decade"" he later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly the lack of humans and their technology really broke him down."	3	3		3																					
1565	3	"The features in the setting of the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do not exeed the Posted Speed limit� affect the cyclist in a cruel manner. The old man say that the towns are going to be there and they are just not functioning towns. To make the cyclist feel hopeless the setting puts him in a California day in June which is extremely hot and puts in all these unexpected twists. A cruel thing to add in the essay was when it read �The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mph� This lowers the cyclists confidence making him seem more worried. Another cruel thing is the author adding a welch�s Grape Juice factory that had been abandoned with �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring @NUM1 refreshing glass of juice into his mouth"" totally causing him to lose hope left. These features in setting are cruel."	3	3		3																					
1566	3	The features in the setting, such as the ghost town desert, and the Juice factory, give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness. He is running out of water when he comes to the ghost town, which he thought was @CAPS1 because the next town was only a short ways down the road. However when he came to the next �town� and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot, foul liquid came up instead of water. He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welch�s factory, abandoned. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming �the birds will pick me clean,� To the cyclist also was best, then he was �saved� by a bait shop. These features in the setting gradually emptied his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his fait in old men, was returned.	2	3		3																					
1569	3	The many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh. In the essay, it says, � on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh.� This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration. � growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke � This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways.	2	1		2																					
1571	3	The setting affected the cycist because it made his ride harder. For example, the weather was extremly hot. �The sun was beginning to beat down.� He says it didn�t affect him, yet he was very thirsty and dehydrated so internally it affected him. Also, the weeds and snakes frightened him. �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� This could not of made his ride easier. Next the hills and roads, �over one long, crippling hill.� This proves how intense his ride was. Thats how the setting affected the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie.	1	2		2																					
1572	3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says� i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can�t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find �towns� nearby. Once he finds them, they are either �ghost towns� or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way.	3	2		3																					
1575	3	The cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� had to go through a hard time in the California desert.  It was hard for him because it was very hot in the desert in June. That he was almost out of water; at first his ride was easy on flat ground. But when he came to rolling he had to use more energy and ???.	1	1		1																					
1576	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier. Finnally there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet.	2	1		2

1579	3	"The setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist. The hot deserted surroundings made the cyclist become tired or discoveraged. For example the cyclist observes, ""one ramshacure shed, several rusty pumps, and a comes that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was trouble."" This quote shows the old, beat down environment worried him. Also the author says, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" In this quote, the cyclist realizes his isolation, and begins to become more determined to reach his destination. Realize, ever been lost, then youknow that it can be discouraging if there's no sign of life around you. All you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way. This feeling is shown through the cyclistand now the setting around him affects his journey."	2	3		3																					
1580	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of them is that it was in the daylight and the sun bothers the cyclist. Another one is that because there was nothing around him, he felt frustrated. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� If something were there, he wouldn�t feel frustrated and at least he would have more hope to find something. 	1	2		2																					
1581	3	"In the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through �The high deserts of California in June.� It was hot, so hot the infact, that the author realized he could �drop from heatstroke� at anytime. This unbearable heat, coupled with the �crippling� hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a stale of severe dehydration. Obviously not exactig a positive effect. The swelting heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the eyeishes diverting water supply. However, �There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind� The cyclist was incomplete isolation for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, the sweating sun heating down upon him as he toiled up steep unyielding hills clearly the setting was affecting the cyclist in horribly negative way."	3	3		3																					
1582	3	When riding a bike for a very long time with no water is bad but is even worst when your surroundings are worst. For example, when the cyclist has no water it is a day with nothing around him to help. Also with no water he could pass out & get dehydrated. When he finds no one to help & nothing around him he sucks on a pebble to keep his mouth hydrated. Therefor you should always check you destination on a bike before just going for it.	2	2		2																					
1583	3	It is very difficult to be outside in heat, let alone advise from old folks and riding a bike. If it feels like it is @NUM1 out sides, you don�t need to be out there. Doesn,t matter how long you are outside for, a heatstroke could come at any body fast than they can count to @NUM2.	1	1		1																					
1584	3	On the way to @CAPS1 the cyclist was riding through dry, hot weather in rough terrain. This was making him tired and dehydrated. Half way throgh his journey he couldn't see anything for miles. That must of been discouraging. All the way there he was dehydrated and when he found water it was @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2 because of the heat.	1	1		1																					
1589	3	The features effect the setting of the story in a big way. At the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the @NUM1 town there is no one around. There are no buildings in site at all and no source of water. Since there was no one around his confidence of actualy completing the trip begar to go down. Once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore. This made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought hed never make it and that he die. Once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water. The setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence.	3	2		3																					
1590	3	The features of a setting, such as terrain and weather greatly affect the cyclist who is biking in it. The features of a setting can make the cyclists trip either easier or harder. Weather can make them use up their water faster or slower, rain as bad road conditions could force a cyclist go slower. In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist is slowed down and more fatigued because of the features of the setting he was in. The lack of water and settlements slowed him down. Rough roads did as well. Hills and animals on the road slowed down the cyclist even more.  The features of a setting can help or hinder a cyclist, and in the case of the one in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features seriously impared his bike ride.	2	2		2																					
1591	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It it was a straight road, it would be smooth sailing. If the road was bumpy, he�d jump up and down a little. If he was riding in the woods, it would be cool and a little dark. If he was riding in the desert, it would be very hot and bright.	1	1		1																					
1594	3	The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly men�s directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. He�s also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old men�s directions. He�s really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if they�ve lost it. 	2	2		2																					
1596	3	According to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example; the author states �I had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June�. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view�. This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclist�s trip and how it affected her.	3	3		3																					
1598	3	The setting adds a sense of ergancy. The cyclist is running out of water and he is the middle of the dessert. If he had been in the forest or the subburbs it would not be so grave. He talks about passing out and dieing. He exclaims it did n�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean.�	2	2		2																					
1601	3	"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist�s narrator�s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, �I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� Even at his first �ghost town� he just �chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on�. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, �One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men�. He said, �this was troubling�, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, �He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story."	3	2		3																					
1603	3	The setting affected the cyclist by making him very hot. He said he started sucking on stones because he heard that if you suck on stones it makes you not thirsty. He also said he might hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks. He said he wanted to swallow the rocks. The reason for that was that he was so hot. He didn�t even no where he was goin.	1	1		1																					
1605	3	The features of the settings effects the cyclist by many reasons such as; dehydration, the road my cause bike to stop working. Since there is a lack of water in the dessert it seems, the guy could get dehydrated easily. The intense heat can cause that to. The road that he is riding on my cause the tires to pop.	1	1		1																					
1611	3	IIn the story I read the setting is a big factor to the affect of the cyclist for example it talks about how the cyclist see�s the sign that says, �Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit.� So the cyclist has to be cautious	1	1		1																					
1613	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding. For example he had no water so he was parched. There was a huge snake that took up half of the road and there wasn�t a building in sight. So the setting affected him with doubt but he had confidence of getting where he needed to get then when he got there it was a sign of relif. Thats how the setting affected was.	1	2		2																					
1615	3	Some of the features like the change in landscape affected the cyclist. Differing from flat land to miniture hills to highways is kind of hard to cope with, especially considering he was dehydrated and had no water.	1	1		1																					
1617	3	"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is �This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June �(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)�. The hotness and heat had also increased the character�s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is �I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I�d be fine �(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."	3	3		3																					
1618	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water. another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down. lastly when he rehydrated himself in the  so the setting was a main factory to the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite national park."	2	1		2																					
1619	3	The cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through. The cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns. Thats when he started to get thirsty. At first he wasn�t tired or thirsty because he was riding by cool trees and rushing water in the morning. Once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast. The lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad. The setting had everything, to do on how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke. That�s how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1621	3	The settings effected the cyclist, because where ever he went it seem to never end. Like when he was riding along where the old men told him to go. He went through a ghost town like they said he would go through a town. Then he kept on going but it never end and the summer heat started to get to him. Like when he started to dehidade he this old juice factor and started imagening that he was drinking juice. So he started seeing things.	1	1		1																					
1622	3	As the author cycles through this shortcut, he is in a very dangerous setting. As said in the poem, he is in the high deserts of California in June. A desert makes the heat unberable for the cyclist. Its just sun, sand, and him. Then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about @NUM1 almost maybe even hotter. This could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply. �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� Then there is the distance of his ride. The author is always saying �About @NUM2 miles� or �Twenty miles up the road.� All of this hard work can cause heatstroke & kill him.	2	2		2																					
1623	3	The features of the setting like the dessert the sun and abondered towns affect the cyclist alot. The dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever. And probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town. The sun makes hime even  hoter not  he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty.The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever doing to make to yosomite. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy. He is content after riding to the first town but then the rest of time towns are abandoned too and start to ran out of water an he thinks he is going to die which makes it sad. Then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop an finds water.	2	3		3																					
1625	3	There are a lot of things that effect the cyclist, such as the heat, having no water, the rough roads and the long trip. The cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot. The narriation says, �and the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated. The roads were very rough, for example, �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The roads became, bumpy, and there were a lot of hill the cyclist had to go over. There was no water either. So he/she was running out of energy and it made it even harder. In the end the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water.	2	2		2																					
1626	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization. The narrator said, �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his llife. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesn�t have making him dehydrate faster. The narrator saids, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of made it so much worse that he had no water.	1	1		1																					
1629	3	There are many affects of the setting in this eassy that, that can be good and or bad. The setting is alone on a empty mountain road, with no house, no cars, no people. In now going to give you some good and bad effects. One good effect is that you by yourself so while you exercise you can relax and enjoy the energy. One bad thing is that what if you pop a tire or need help. You stock because theirs no one around. Another good thing is that you being by yourself, @CAPS1 any cars. You don�t have to worry about getting hit so you�ll be able to just relax and enjoy the ride . Another bad thing is there is no water so you might want to bring plenty with you. So whatever you decide to do just be careful and think you idea thought  	1	1		1																					
1630	3	The setting or environment the cyclist was in made him feel isolated from the rest of the world. He knew the was no turning back once he started his adventure. No one was their to help him. The environment made him to realize the many risk involved in this adventure. The knowledge that there is no help was his motive to continue on his long journey.	1	1		1																					
1631	3	"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says �with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat� when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he �drank deeply from the sink.� The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1632	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affects the cyclist because he has to cross different types of land marks. First, he got information from the old people. For example, when he showed the map to the old people their only going to know the old short cuts not the new ones. Second, when he ran out of water. For instance, when the cyclist ran out of water he had to climb hills and that tired him out. Plus when he tried to get water from that one thing only hot water come out last, when he finally got to a story the old guy had a map. For example, when he asked the old guy about the place he was going to he said I have my own map. So therefore he knew he was in trouble. In  conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1636	3	The effect of cyclist is very and treding becose alot of thing can go worrs like you can feel so hot have and water wouldn�t cool down it didn�t matter. But when drop in you mouth had the flavor of battery acid. He or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeus day in June. So hot that you are seeing thing like a town hot pouring a refeshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave.  	1	1		1																					
1637	3	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, �This sight was troubling�I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.� With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called �easy way out.� 	1	1		1																					
1638	3	In the story the setting affected the cyclist all through the story till he arrived at body and wilbers fish camp. As the man rides his bike for a while he is of but as he road into the first town it seemed to be a ghost town. As he pedal on � The sun was beginning to beat down but I barely noticed it�. At that time the wheater is affecting him a lot but he keeps Yosemite cool pines and rushing rivers in his head He also only had only a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottle while going up a big hill.	2	1		3																					
1639	3	The setting of this Essay is to tell cyclest were to go without getting them lost and to never take advice from old people.	1	1		1																					
1646	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, �through the high deserts of California in June.� This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had no where to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder.	2	2		2																					
1648	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting affects the story very much for many reasons. First, it is in the summer, so it is very hot. Also, it is in the desert in the west, so there is a very warm climate already. Third, there is not any civilization on the �shortcut� he follows, so there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	2		2																					
1650	3	The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water, the cyclist was absolutely fine. As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct.	2	2		2																					
1656	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, the as the cyclist rode on for the first miles, he did not see anything in sight. This made him less determined to reach his goal. Then, in paragraph @NUM1, the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal. The cyclist�s determination went down as long as he was riding. But then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself.	2	1		2																					
1659	3	The  cyclist  runs  into some pretty tough challenges. The real vies of the setting affected him, because there was so many optical that he had to overcome, for  example, he  got directions  from some old men who move then lively didn�t really know what they were talking about. Then he ran out of water so he had nothing to drink and the road started to get bumpily and he saw snakes. There were no buildings nor cars around so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed. He came  up on an old factory, that was thought to be the Welch�s Grape juice, factory, but was abandoned and looked like it had been for a while, towards the end he found this fish came where he finally got water and was around people. These different optical affected his mood and how determined he was.	3	2		3																					
1661	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist. He is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird. After that he starts to ride through the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more. When he arrives at the abandoned juice factory he is almost completely out of energy and almost can�t go on any further in his journey until he finally arrives at the bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him.	2	2		2																					
1662	3	The cyclist was begging to feel that death was coming his way as he continued withought a building in sight. This made him grow histerical over the situation, and still have enough energy to feel sorry for himself. Then when he finally did see a building he thought it was a mirage.	1	1		1																					
1663	3	The location of a cyclist�s ride affects the person�s attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst.The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked �brackish.� So, setting can break a cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1664	3	The setting in the passage is working against the cycler. Hes running low on water hes almost dehydrated and the weather were hes at is very very hot and he cant see a town for miles.	1	1		1																					
1666	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the good way. For examples he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport. He would be rich because he would win the contest of cycling.	0	0		0																					
1667	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie many obstacles are caused from the diffrent settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled � I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. � This caused the loss of determination, which led to him lossing his consciousness. The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually  make him lose consciousness. He said � if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time.�  	2	1		2																					
1668	3	The setting of the story had effected the cycle�s becuse if it was sub earbs he could have stoped any where and got water but the plot was in a middle of a desert and all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water For example, he had to go @NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water and if he was not in the desert with hills he could have made that in no time at all    	1	1		1																					
1669	3	The cyclist was affected by many features of the setting. The flat road soon became bumpy hills, which were made harder to cycle because of lack of water. The hot desert sun and lack of towns and people also made the journey difficult.	1	1		1																					
1670	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is to hot. It is hot enough that his water tasts like battery acid.  Then he has to deal with difficult trails breakway he said �old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� This is sayin that the old-timers gave him old directions. Plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop. Then when he was riding he said �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.� With him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat. This was why the setting was affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1671	3	There are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. One reason is because it is so hot, I know this because it was sammertime in the California desert. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the sign that he saw that said �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1). This tells you that the road is very rough. And being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from. There is no one around to give him a drink of water. These are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1672	3	The setting of this story is outside. Yosemite is outside riding her bike. She is around hills, no water, and very hot land. You know that she is around hills because she says to herself, �� I maneuvered down the hill.� You also know that she starts of around no??? ???good water. �When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid�� that shows the water was bad. Also the land is very hot because it says ��in the??? ???of two hundred degrees.� Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemite�s biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid. 	1	1		1																					
1674	3	"The stoy of the cyclist features of the setting affect of the cyclist, The cyclist had to go thoug a lot "" The speed limit was @NUM1. The was doing a water depleting @NUM2, Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� The cyclist love ride their bike they enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening"" to cycling."	1	1		1																					
1675	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the river and the pine trees �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"". Thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" and a sign on another road said �rough road ahead� The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low. �the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing  sips.� Not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandon or �ghost town�. The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite national park."	2	3		3																					
1677	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, �These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,� If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I�m glad the cyclist didn`t. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him.	2	2		2																					
1678	3	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, �That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office�. This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who haven�t left their homes in years.	2	2		2																					
1680	3	The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, �and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke� the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, �I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.� This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally.	2	2		2																					
1681	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the author faces many obstacles because of the different terrain changes on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclist�s physical state, but his mood and determination as well.  "	3	2		3																					
1683	3	The setting of the road affected the cyclist in many different ways. Because there were no towns on the road it made it very difficult for him to find water which led him into a dehydrated state. �The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so. The rolling hills of the road were making him use more energy. Because there was no buildings for miles be broke the ride into short distances	2	1		2																					
1684	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in so many ways. Some ways the cyclist was affected is, the lack of water was the biggest problem he had. The group of the old guys that gave him directions werent a big help at all. The men gave the cyclist directions be what they remember when they were younger in age. The cyclist knew not to take directions from the old men, but they seemed so sure about what they were talking about to him. The cyclist first had determination to get to his destination. As he begin to get hotter and more thirster into giving up. As soon as he was about to give up his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him now. He stumbled across water.	2	2		2																					
1685	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date. �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confine of their porches since carter was in office,� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt to pleased. Therefore the cyclist went through some though times.	1	2		2																					
1687	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, �The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water�� He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn�t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing.	3	3		3																					
1689	3	You came alway choose your features because you idea mind be change over time.	0	0		0																					
1691	3	He is going on a journey on his bike. He has to go down hills and deal with the factt that has has no water. That�s basically what the setting is about.	3	2		3																					
1692	3	When riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist. Some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad will make the cyclist second guest: riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and even more exhasted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and all he/she sees is a desert then they might have doubts on where there going. If there are abandon buildings everywhere the cyclist @MONTH1 become frighten and want to head back of lose hope as shown in the story �Do not exceed the speed limit� when he gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Many things can affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1695	3	"The features of the setting in, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� affect the cyclist in many ways. After following the old mens' advice he sets off on his journey. After the first town appears the sun realy starts to beat down which realy affects the cyclist. In the essay it says �The sun was beginning to heat beat down, but I barely noticed it.� He @MONTH1 have not noticed it yet but then later on the long winding road on the new flat terrain he runs out of water and that is real dangerous in weather that hot. The text says, �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water- depleting @NUM2.� In this part of the story it proves that the cyclist is out of water. In this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures. In the story it says, �I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� This entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this sort of setting. The features of the setting in �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� affects the cyclist greatly."	2	3		3																					
1697	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed� by @PERSON1, the cyclist faces problems caused by the setting. The biker was riding and the heat was scourching and the biker was really getting dehydrated and tired and he was running out of water. Because it was so hot the biker had to drink more water to replenish his body of all the sweat he was loosing while biking. The hills of the terrain were making it harder on the biker by making him us more energy and liquid to keep going. If it had been cool and breezy he would have had no problem making that distance. If the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns than he would have had water to drink.	1	1		1																					
1698	3	"Every body experiences physical and emotional pain, but most probably wouldn't have survived what the cyclist in this story went through. The man started a bike ride Yosemite National park, but when some eldrerly men told him a short cut, his adventure had just because. First at all, every ""town""and ""building"" the men told him he would come to, would come to, wound up being completely desserted. At first this wasn't a big deal to the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph when he came to his first desserted town he, ""chuckled, checked [his] water town supply, and moved."" @CAPS1, as his journey progressed, his water decreased.He was then in desperation for a town.On topof thatin the story he wrote, ''the tast roadwas replaced short, rolling hills. ""This made his biking harder and he was then becoming denyarated. He finally found a town with water, but learned his lesson from taking advice from strangers and old men. "	3	3		3																					
1701	3	In  rough raod ahead by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Because he was in the desert of California in June, he water supply was emicated and he came across a ghost town. His hope was dwindling because of this. He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map. That is how the feature affected the setting.	2	2		2																					
1703	3	The cyclist is alone traveling on a flat land at first following the direction in which the old men told him to get to Yosemite National Park in @LOCATION1. During his travels he becomes dehydrated cycling over hills and deserts with othe sun beating down on him in such hot weather of June, he realizes he could get a heart stroke without water. His travels are desolate and lonely and when he finally sees building which are realy ghost towns he recovers and finds some determination to speed up. The cyclist luckily found a camp site to save him from passing out in a desert where he could rest, get water, then carry on his journey using his own map.	3	2		3																					
1708	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man�s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	2	2		2																					
1710	3	The story �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted, speed limit � tells of a biking trip gone wrong. But the story would  not be as terrifying if it had happend in a different place. The setting plays a large role in the story. The story begins on a present summer evening but as the man bikes he arrives at ghost town devold of evil life, later feeling of double sets In when he arrives at �one ramshockle shed, severall rusty pumps and a corrol that couldn�t hold these lamest mule. � later we fear panic set in as these terrain becomes hilly and tumbleweeds and snakes cross the path. Like an cold wesstern. Finally all  hope is lost when he reaches these grapes Juice factory and fInd, �a sand blasted picture of a Young boy, � The setting is a power full tool which greatly influences the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
1711	3	"In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected they cyclists physical abilities. The features affected is abilities, because the climate and dangerous environment was hot and rough to handle. These features were hot and rough 'Since he was in the California deserts in June. The passage that supports this is,�. Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Also, the features of the setting give him determination. They give him determination, because each horizon he sees gives him hope. They give him hope since he knows he is that much @NUM1 to Yosemite National Park. The passage that supports this is when he drops,"".distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that @CAPS1 could move it that far, I�d be fine.� In the story,"" Rough road ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of his settings affect both they cyclists physical and mental abilities"	2	3		3																					
1712	3	"The features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. There was a point in the story where he ran out of water ad he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the rode. He was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road. So he started off and the two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. ""Sometimes life can be so cruel.� @CAPS1 hills took a lot out of him and he was now on a highway. Before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily. �I could make that!� But after the terrain change he looses hope and almost don�t make it. �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough it has a huge negative effect on the cycilists."	3	2		3																					
1717	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is riding through the desert in the middle of June yet he has very little water. This affects him because he is thirsty but he doesn�t have a lot of water to drink and he is in a desert in the middle of June which makes it very hot. Also in the story it says he comes to Welch�s Grape Juice Factory were on the side of the building he see picture of a �young boy pouring a refreshing a loss of juice into his mouth� This make the cyclist even thirstier but he continues one to find water at a bait shop.	1	1		1																					
1718	3	The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First comes the windy roads. As he goes along his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. �Not the miley into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. �This shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is over whollmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before hagon up, he found a place to get water and to relax. �Then, as easily as running about, my troubles thirst, and nor were all behind me� This shows that he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and it made happy and have a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined.	3	3		3																					
1722	3	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path. He had lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.�  	2	2		2																					
1723	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist like if you have to goup hill or along long bumpy type roads. Then in the essay it says �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit: @CAPS1 does make things more difficult than average. Especially with a lack of water to make things worse.	1	1		1																					
1727	4	The author concludes the story with this because gardens cannot grow with snow on the ground. So she she figurers when all the snow is melted she�ll try to grow another one. I feel as if she wasn�t  happy enough to grow another garden I think she should be more interested in growin it then disappointed.    	0	0		0																					
1728	4	The narrater has that in with Paragraph becuse it all makes sence and it go'ss along together. The narrater says that when the guiss come out and the hibicus is budding is becuse it is ones more agian spring   	0	0		0																					
1732	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author wanted to tell about about when saeng will take the test again. The author told the time with the season of the spring. In spring all the snows were melted and the geese and hibiscus has budding. And this paragraped make the reader to understand easyer. This is why the author include this paragraph in the story. 	1	1		1																					
1733	4	"The story ended with the author saying, ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is upset about spending @NUM1 on a plant that she had felt was different than the plant at home. She is stating that she is not going to take the test of buying one again until the geese return and the Hibiscus budds."	0	0		0																					
1734	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing. In the paragraph she is basically saying when the geese return and my flower is budding I'll be prepared enough to take the test. She'll be prepared because she'll be adapted enough and she'll have experienced enough just like the plant and the geese. She Is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower.	2	1		2																					
1736	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, it concludes the story with a good ending. In the story the girl buys a Hibiscus that remainds her of home. She goes home & tells her mother she failed her test but bought the plant. While she was planting it she seen geese and she was reminded of home. America was like home and she was happier. In the text she says, ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now."" She is willing to give the test another try and is sure to pass it. America is now starting to feel a little more like home. "	2	2		2																					
1738	4	I think he concluded the story with paragraph cause then do thing in the story and the report it so when the geese left they will come back and leave again so that what I think I take the test again means.	0	0		0																					
1739	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when every thing starts coming back she will take the test. That is why the author concludes the story with this parigraph	1	1		1																					
1745	4	"the author concludes the story this way because Saeng failed the test, the hibiscus comforts her, and she feels she is similar to the geese. For example, Saeng says �I-I failed the test.� She has admitted to failing the test and is upset about it and wants to �take that test again."" @CAPS1, Saeng says,"" And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar, too, �while describing the hibiscus. The familiarity of the plant comforts her and will allow her to build up the courage to �take the test again.� Finally, at one point Saeng thinks to herself, ""the quiet repetition of season opon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.� Saeng feels similar to the geese in this way and this allows her to decide to take the test � when the snow melts and the geese return.� The author concludes the story strongly, describing how Saeng failed the test, how the hibiscus comforts her and she feels similar to the geese."	2	3		3																					
1746	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph because she will be reminded of her homeland and going home. The reason I say that is because the geese are returning home and she wants to. Also the hibiscus will be budding in the wild just like back home	1	1		1																					
1747	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph by teaching Saeng how to be confident and vow silently, In order to teach her more lessons because of the fact she failed the test in the middle of the passage Saeng tells her mother that when the snow is gone in the spring time she will retake the test that she failed. Her mother was very upset when she found out that Saeng failed the test the first time.	1	1		1																					
1753	4	I think that she ended the story like that because it means that she is getting used to all the seasons. �In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hisbiiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� She will and take the test once its not cold anymore so she will wait until the geese come again which will be spring by then. I think that she is also trying to say that when the snow melts and the geese are there again she will have taken the test and pass it. This is I think she ended it like this because how they mean something to her.	1	1		1																					
1754	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how everything is changing and adapting to the change. Saeng decides that with this change, she can also adapt to her new life by going back and passing the drivers test. The hibiscus also represents how something also from her homeland has come to america and must now survive. When it begins to bud, Saeng will begin to start adapting to america by passing her drivers test. It�s all about trying to become accustomed to changes. When Saeng feels bad for failing, that�s why something from her past is such a comfort to her.	2	2		2																					
1756	4	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because Saeng feels most comfortable taking the test again when what she explained happens. Saeng misses where she came from alot. She promised herself that she would take the test again when that happens. With Saeng saying that it makes you wonder why she wont take the test again the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. It makes her feel really comfortable when that does happen.	1	1		1																					
1759	4	The author concludes the story, �winter hibiscus,� with this paragraph of the story, for several relevant reasons. By concluding the story, in this way it shows Saeng�s growth, and more willingness to strive, and do her best. When she says she will take the test again, it shows her gain of confidence, and her beginning to gain comfort in the place that is not her home country. She is now striving and working toward doing her best to become successful. And she is making the very best of the given situation. The author is trying to give more depth and meaning to the study in this way. Saeng went from being nervous and worried when saying, �I-I failed the test,� to now setting a goal for herself to take it again, the time the bud blooms next year. Basically, the author did a full circle, by ending the story in this way. From speaking of the test, to sharing the flower experience with her mother, to state that she will re-take the test, next year. 	3	2		3																					
1761	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when saeng and her mother go back to there home where the flowers were more beautiful than the flowers where there living now. She wants to plant flowers that�s going to remind her of her home. In the story saeng mother said that it�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here this winter hibiscus her mother wanted her to know that the only thing that maths is that the plant can last threw winter.	1	1		1																					
1764	4	The reason the author of the story �Winter hibiscus� ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up. We need to preserve through every problem we go through in life. If we don�t and we just give up we will never get anything done in life. She vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. I hope I pass my driving test the first time just like I did the learner�s permit test. Also you can�t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up.	1	2		2																					
1769	4	I belive the author concludes with that quote for an assortment of reasons. One is to show that the charecter isn�t just going to give up, that her failing wasn�t the end for her. This shows sorting like morale of never giving up. It feels as the character is referring to the hibiscus as sensely. �The hibiscus will be budding�   which means that she herself will branch out and learn more. By the spring time she would have learned enough and experienced enough to try to pass the test again. The hibiscus also reminds her of her home. When she will look at it she will find the courage to pull through and to face her challenges like her test.The ending quotealso wraps up the story.It also shows the charecters will of not giving up and to always try.	2	2		2																					
1771	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wrote the same thing that it had in the paragraph and he wrote it in his story but added a little more details to it and problems and things.	0	0		0																					
1773	4	"The author had concluded this story with this paragraph to make it as if they were on a clean slate like they had started over. So the past no longer haunts them. Saeng sounds as if she has a bit of relief after she takes her mom the plate. I believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she sounds sure of herself. She sounds certain she sounds as if she want to start over because she says ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. To me she sounds like a brand new person. Who has forgotten about the past."	1	2		2																					
1775	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng�s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about.	3	2		3																					
1777	4	"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because Saeng is saying when the good time came back around she will try for the test again because She had failed it. for example on page @NUM1 at the top She "" I-I falled the test"" thats why i think the author concludes this with the Story because it was important to Saeng to past the test in the good time of season Spring. "	1	1		1																					
1778	4	�Winter Hibiscus �is about a girl saeng, who moved from Vietnam to the @ORGANIZATION1. After she fails her driver�s test. She walks home and finds a hibiscus. �She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long gray hair�� She goes to a flower shop to see if it can be purchased. She pays a lot of money for the plant because it is rare and valuable. It is special to her because she used to have hibiscus plants in Vietnam. She brings the plant home & tells her mom that it reminds her of Vietnam. The mom says that it reminds her of Vietnam too. The mom is not happy with how much saeng paid for it. She plants it in her garden.� When the hibiscus was lowered in the ground, a flock of geese flew by.�When the hibiscus returns in the spring,  saeng will take her driver�s test again. In the spring, all the flowers start to bud and bloom. Everything is new again. saeng will have a new chance to pass her test.	2	2		2																					
1781	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows Saeng passion for gardening. How she�s willing to take the test is to see if her plants can grow when spring comes around and the hibiscus starts to bud she will attempt to grow it which shows how anxious Saeng is for gardening and to try and get the hibiscus to grow during the spring.	0	0		0																					
1782	4	The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.	1	1		1																					
1783	4	Change and disappointment are enough to over-come. Some people have an arid fear of change. For Saeng the main character from �winter Hibiscus,� change comes in the form of a move to @LOCATION1. Everything around her is different and new. Coupled with disappointment of failing her driver's exam, the feeling of living helpless overwhelms her. After buying a winter hibiscus plant, she vows to take the test again when it blooms in the spring. The resiliance of the winter flower and the memories it represents inspire seng to try again.	2	3		3																					
1784	4	I think the author wanted to express Saeng when she took a vowed and to express the way he felt. When the statement was made that also I think it was to make readers feel interest in it but mainly to help understand.	0	0		0																					
1785	4	For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior. She said ��when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again. So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     	1	2		2																					
1786	4	I believe that the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuation in life. In the story Saeng takes a �test� and fails. She goes out and buys a hibiscus plant for well over what she what she should have paid for it. Her test is to try to get over the memories of her real �home� that Saeng is now only cries about when she thinks of it. To Saeng the plant represents memories and a life that she once had, but no longer does, however does want it back. Her vowe to herself is that when the geese come flying back over her that she will go back to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home and try once again to say �home� without breaking down, and without having something extremely expensive.	2	2		2																					
1788	4	"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. Saeng missed her home. It was hard for her to say her country�s home without crying. ""It�s not like the wind we had at-at-."" She also spent @MONEY1 on a plant because it remind her of back at home. One could inter she adapted because she was familiar with the season change and it states when the geese return she is going to take the test again."	1	2		2																					
1789	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes Saeng feel more at home. For example it say, �the snow melt, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. �I think the author says this because all the thing in that sentence remind her of home. For example the plant the geese are things she had at home, so when winter is over she will feel better and take the test.  	1	1		1																					
1790	4	The reason why the author ended with Saeng vowed iS because she is very commited. She failed the first time but know she really want to pass it so she is waiting until the snow melt and @CAPS1 geese return and this hibiscus is buddin @CAPS2 she will come back	1	1		1																					
1791	4	I think that the author concluded the story like that because of who throw out the whole Story the plot was in the winter. She might wanted to try it in a different season to see if she might to better with the whot setvation. That is why I think the author concluded the story like that.  	0	0		0																					
1792	4	I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more. For example, she added �hibiscus is budding.� Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it.	1	1		1																					
1795	4	The authors concludes that in the paragraph. I think he concluded that in these because it shows alot of confidence about her. For example when she said, �then I will take that test again�. It sounded very confident and made it where she can want to try if she or he fails the first time.	2	3		3																					
1796	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she has not given up on her dreams.	1	1		1																					
1798	4	The author is saying that she�s not doing nothing intell it is a nice day outside. Also she want it to be not that cold but not that not for she can come out and play with her children. Then she said she will take her test again for a nice day outside for her.	1	1		1																					
1799	4	The author ends the story with this conclusion to show that @PERSON1 is very passionate about connecting her life in the United States, to how life was in Vietnam and bringing them together somehow. In the story, @PERSON1 talks about how she misses home and how she is still trying to adapt to her new life away from the home she knew, when saeng says that she has failed the test and wants to take it again, she means that she wants to show that she can survive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When saeng spent @MONEY1 on a plant, her mom was in disbelief because Saeng knows how hard it is to survive. When the conclusion says,�I will take the test again,� it shows that Saeng is willing try to make it in the United States from Vietnam, proving that she can make a better life for herself and her family by working hard. While still keeping trditions in Vietnam alive. Saeng simply wanted to make her new home feel like Vietnam by buying a plant she knew her mother would like.	2	2		2																					
1800	4	The author might have concluded this story because it like a downfall. Which mean like right now he�s at the bottom and got to make it to the top. He is going to start over and take the test again, but thes time he is not going to fail.	1	1		1																					
1803	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng has found from hibiscus plant. Like the  plant Saeng is going to overcome an obstacle. She will try the driving test again and the plant will overcome. The harsh   ,blutal winter months. The plant will bloom in the spring and show its restrency during adversity. Saeng   will also overcome the  adversity  she faced when failed her driving test and realizing how much she missed her homeland. Saeng too, in a sense will bloom in the spring. The winter, representing her despise  and homesickness, will not present her from living happly and taking the test over.The hibiscus reminds her of the. The story ends with the paragraph to show how the � Winter Hibiscus� has taught her something about overcoming obstacles.	3	2		3																					
1806	4	I think that the story came back to this because that is what the story starts off with. It all started with Saeng going to take a test but she did not pass it. So when the weather is better she would have a batter time trying to pass that test. This is way I think she came back that the test.	1	1		1																					
1808	4	"The author ends the story with that paragraph, to give an unsight on the next story. I think there will be another story because there are clue to support my theory. Just at the beginning of the paragraph at just when they come back. Then at the end at stay ""then I will take the test again. I dint stay happily ever after at anything similar its that at just stated those personally changes mentioned. So I think what the author will write another story so we could see if Saeng will pass her test.   "	1	1		1																					
1809	4	The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it�s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life.	2	2		2																					
1812	4	"The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is a about a girl who moved with her mother to @LOCATION1. The story tells about the girls transition into the different culture. During the story, the author makes references to the daughter having to pass a test. At the end of the story the author wrote �In the spring�then I will take that test again.� In the text, the girl says �it�s-it�s not a real one,� when referring to the winter hibiscus plant she bought. The reader could infer that this quote means that the girl has memories of home, but they are not the real thing. Also the author wrote �� much preferred it to the Big Mac"". This quote shows that she misses her own culture & cannot adapt to the @CAPS1 one that she lives in now. In conclusion, the girls test @MONTH1 be that she needs to be able to handle change & also be able to recall memories of her homeland with happiness instead of sadness."	2	3		3																					
1817	4	The author concludes the story the way that they did to signify that the girl will not give up trying to pass her test and will adapt to her new found home and make it what her home in Vietnam was to her. The girl is remeniscent of her past life and wishes to go back and have the life she had in her home country. When she is  	1	1		1																					
1818	4	"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says �when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story �Winter Hibiscus� used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."	3	2		3																					
1821	4	The author concludes the end; of the story the way he/she did because it shows how much the plant truly means. S'aeng is going to wait till the flower blooms because it means so much to her. The flower represents her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive. The plant gives her hope for a new tommorow, a new chance. The last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl, its significance. It makes her feel more at home, and her home makes her feel stranger; makes her joyful and happy after the misery of failing the driving test.	2	2		2																					
1825	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost farmllular to her now� & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas.	1	1		1																					
1826	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with the paragraph for a few reasons. One reason is that she is trying to overcome change and wants to make the situation better. She trys doing that by taking the test again. The author also concludes with the paragraph because she feels heartbroken that life is not going her way and that she needs to do something about it. Thats why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show you if she is determined or not. If she will stick through it or not.	2	2		2																					
1827	4	I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country. This is a good way to leave off the story because you don�t know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I also tink this is a good way to leave it off because he could write a sequal to it and make a series out of it.	1	1		1																					
1828	4	The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nices thing around.	0	0		0																					
1831	4	I think that the author made that the concluding sentence because it means that when Saeng is ready then she will take the test again. I think that she is comparing herself to the snow, the snow the geese, and the hibiscus. I think so because she says that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. So I think that she is saying that she is not ready for the test and when she does get ready then that is when she will take it.	2	1		2																					
1834	4	To her the hibiscus was a test. Saeng felt she failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing �now.� The hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent over @MONEY1 on it, knowing she and her mother needed the money. Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test.	1	1		1																					
1835	4	I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test. For example when she said, �When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
1836	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the main character Saeng and her mother, moved from their homeland to this new place, where everything was different. she was having a very hard time adapting to this new place, and Saeng failed an importian test. She had been very discouraged by this, and she was trying to remind herself of being at home. She bought the winter Hibiscus to remind her of home, but when she was planting it she became very determined to try and adapt, by taking the test, when the hibiscus would bud. The author is concluding by there being hope, and determination for Saeng to adapt to her new home.	2	2		2																					
1837	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it adds the uplifting message that Saeng will be able to overcome the obstacles of living in an unfamiliar country. First; the @CAPS1 geese represent a piece of her new home because she reasons �reluctantly� that they are familiar to her now, This depicts her ability to adapt to her new environment. In addition, she also equates spring to when the habiscus is budding and the habiscus is a symbol of herself because both are trying to live in a country that is not their own. Therefore, the habiscus budding represents her being able to live comfortably in @LOCATION1. Finally, she vows that she will take her drivers test again. Her intial failure to pass the test showed her inability to become a part of @LOCATION1, but if she passes it. Then she will have successfully adapted. Overall, the author of this stoy concludes with this paragraph because it contains the theme of the passage through an uplifting message.  	3	2		3																					
1839	4	She will try gardning again after the geese and flowers return. She wants to have the best garden around. She wants to keep the tradition going.	0	0		0																					
1840	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause. Saeng didn�t think the winter hibiscus was In the ground now and that when she got back all of her plants was gone do to the snow so she said she will take that test again meaning she will start back to the first steps of her plants and flowers.	0	0		0																					
1842	4	The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it�s related to she thinks, when her semile of welcome warmed Saeng �cheep skip over live to you�re back she saw cheerfully� @CAPS1 it�s past time what took you so long? now did it go? Did you? She feels very skip over its related to	0	0		0																					
1843	4	�When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The story �winter hibiscus� ended with this paragraph because it will be a fresh start for Saeng. It will be spring out and the geese will come back to her home where she lives now, which now has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home. The paragraph also compares Saeng to the hibiscus. In the story her mother says, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matters.� Saeng is the winter hibiscus that�s strang enough to make it through winter and failing the test won�t matter until spring when she will take it and pass. That�s represented when the hibiscus is in bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saeng�s feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home. It�s also showing her ability to conquer obstacles. She is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring.	3	3		3																					
1844	4	I think the author concludes the story with that Paragraph because the hibiscus makes them over come obstacles. She wanted to take the test again so she can @CAPS1 to her mum that she can past it. I also, think that because the hibiscus gives them strenghth and she got more confident in herself to past the test.	1	1		1																					
1845	4	The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know. The ending also tells the reader that persistance is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow melting, the geese returning and the flower blooming which are things that happen constantly and almost stop because they refuse to give up and die. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance. The author also chose to end with this paragraph since it has several analogies to persistance which is vital in life.   	3	3		3																					
1846	4	The authoR concludes the stoRy with this paRagRaph because he is saying that Saeng likes to do thing in the spring when she sees flowers gRowing because she feels like she is at home, so she feel moRe confident. about passing the test.	1	1		1																					
1847	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concluded the story with the quote ""when they come back, Saeng's vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" the auther put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change. She failed the test but wants to take it again. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense. When he grandmother ""comes back"" then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again."	2	2		2																					
1848	4	The auther ends with that paragraph to show how Saeng, like the budding  Hibiscus, will get a new start in the spring and overcome obstacles.	1	1		1																					
1849	4	The auther concludes the story with, �when they cam back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and tis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think the auther used that conclusion to make the reader want to finish the story on their own. Or he could write another story to finish it. Most authors conclude their storys like this so the reader is in control about the ending.	1	1		1																					
1850	4	Based on my understanding of the story I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to emphize what will happened as well as to gate back to get to readler to thinking and build te excitement and with question as well as though in the head after reading the pessage. to my self to capture the reader attention as to the following upto and wondering of she survive and was able to adapt to the lifestyle that she was not use to and also see test her ability to see if she will be able to survive the different types of season and to know that no matter what you face in life their is alway more obstacles a head of you.	2	1		2																					
1851	4	The author choose to end the story with that paragraph for emotional meanings. The last paragraph is saying she will re-take the test when the hibiscus is blooming in the spring. She hopes that the blooming hibiscus will give her strength to pass the test. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland and gives her comfort. Saeng hopes the sight of the blooming hibiscus will remind her of her home and give her strength to pass the test.	2	1		2																					
1852	4	The author ends the story in this way because the plant and leaving of the geese represent change to Saeng. The hibiscus isn't the same as she remembers from back home. The budding of the hibiscus shows Saeng's happiness from home. This paragraph shows that the familiarity of the budding plant gives Saeng courage and the ability to overcome her obstacle. The geese in this paragraph represent the keeping of time. The plant will budd at the time the geese return in the spring. If the author hadn't included this final paragraph, the full effect of memories for Saeng wouldn't have been fully portrayed. This line implies that Saeng was unable to overcome her obstacle because of the newness of this place. when the budds bring her a sense of home, she will be able to defeat the obstacle of her driving test. She will be more confident.	1	2		2																					
1853	4	The author includes that because it show that she is not given up. Since she is not given up she can have more trys.	1	1		1																					
1855	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending but I have no idea on what that means so the author should explain what it means not me.	0	0		0																					
1860	4	Confidence, persistance, memories � all things that Saeng has �that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy, she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and @CAPS1 from Vietnam; @CAPS1 she sees reminds her of it, that last paragraph, where it says, �then I will take that test again,� shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she won�t give up, Saeng misses almost @CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. She also misses her family and how they look and dress. Her memories were probably hold her back from concentrating hard on her drivers test, she knows she wanted to do good so she bought the flower in hopes that would make her feel better. Hopefully, Saeng�s life will get better in the United states and she will learn to love this country.	1	2		2																					
1861	4	Because withe the blooming of the hibiscuse plant comes new hope. In the story she sees the hibiscuse as her old life and with the budding of the plant starts a new chapter in the young girls life.	1	1		1																					
1862	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he�s trying to prove his point. I think that Saeng was comparing herself to the flower. For example the flower was originally a wild flower and then and then it was planted in a pot. Saeng was free happy girl but then she had to move to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng feel like they are out of place. Since in the story Saeng is similar to the flower then at the end then at the end of the story I think that Saeng thinks that if the flower can survive the winter then she can survive @LOCATION1 and she can pass the test. This is why I think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across.	3	2		3																					
1868	4	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) @CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and won�t give up. �Saeng  vowed silently to herself, �I will take that test again�, Finally I think  the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how  they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, @CAPS2, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again.	2	3		3																					
1869	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the reader compare the girl to the geese and the hibiscus. The geese leave for the. winter and then come back in the spring, however the geese also show how the girl is going to come back and take the drivers test again in the spring. The hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring, this shows that winter is its weakness. Like the hibiscus the girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by remembering her homeland. The author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so you can see that the girl is like the geese and the hibiscus.	3	2		3																					
1874	4	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant represent to being determined to survive. In other words, the hibiscus brings Saeng a good luck for her next driving test after winter season uhen the hibiscus is budding. Also, the reason why the author concluded the sentence to show what her plan for the future	1	1		1																					
1877	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. In this story it about a @PERSON1, a girl and her mother. The girl is given money to buy a plant seeds. She spend @MONEY1 on this plant. Her mother get upset, but every thing turn on it, lk they had egg omlets with bits of melon.	1	1		1																					
1878	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she wants to show that after everything that happened, saeng will move on and try hard. For example, when she said, �When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� By ending the story like this, it leaves the reader in suspense because they do not know if the geese will return. The author seems to be showing the reader that Saeng is starting to adapt to her new country and make it like her old one. For example, when the mother said, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.� This shows that they want their new country to be more like their old one and when it is, she will be happy. Therefore, the author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how she will adapt to the change in her environment.   	2	2		2																					
1882	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph he/she wanted to compare Saeng life with the plant. For example, in the story Saeng had just failed her driving test and then she saw a plant the reminded her of homeland. From the flower shop to the house, she is comparing her home land to the flower which shows how she relates to it. So the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase she will too and go for her drivers license.	2	1		2																					
1884	4	I think that the author put that sentence to get a little personal with the character so you can relate to that person.	0	0		0																					
1886	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author Minfong Ho concludes the story with that paragraph because it was a way of saying shes going to forget about what happen in the past with her failing her test and shes going to do better the next time. Its like the author is saying she will be reborn again like the hibiscus, when the spring comes. Through the story Saeng had to adjust just like the hibiscus. And the hibiscus inspired Saeng to do well where shes at. So it�s a new beginning to Saeng, after all her learning from hibiscus."	2	2		2																					
1887	4	It�s kind of like a theme for the story. The hibiscuss inspire her to want to do things. I guess it brings memories of her home country and makes her want to try new things. This is significant to the story because it shows you how important the hibiscus was to saeng.	1	1		1																					
1888	4	I think the authour chose to end the story this way to show that the girl is remembering her past and being at, ease. with the flower she at a since of peace. The writer wants to convey that no matter what your used to you can find something that can bring you happiness and a since of focus.	1	1		1																					
1889	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 she is detarmand to pass that test and is not going to give up until she passes it.	1	1		1																					
1891	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by �Minfong Ho� she ends the story by saying, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. �I-I failed the test�. As many kids do, Saeng failed her driving test and she is crucially upset about it. nobody wants to fail at something and it is almost a humiliating experience to have failed at a test. knowing that others have already successfully passed. With the quote in the introduction paragraph, or the one in the question, it was written as a sign of symbolism. When the geese return back north, it is to show that they are ready to �start over� again or to �try again�. When the hibiscus is budding it is trying to �start life� again. Saeng seeing objects doing things over and over again empowers her to want to succeed and try again. She realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail. Minfong concludes with that quote because she understands that no matter what the obstacle, you must press forward and keep trying in order to succeed. She realizes success can only come from hard work and commitment, and that that is what makes a great, strong individual.	2	3		3																					
1892	4	The reason why the author concludes the paragraph with that sentence is because her wants to let reader know that it's not over. He wants the reader to know @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget. And also that all this will happen again.	1	1		1																					
1894	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants. When she gets  gets  back she wants the snow to melt and everything. That is what the author is telling me from the story.	0	0		0																					
1896	4	The author concludes the story with thise paragraph so that we buy his comming book, or so that we get more exited.	1	1		1																					
1898	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, that cannot pass the test until it is. �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of before had become through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. �This shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants because she is thinking back to other times where things have been strange during the winter and better in the spring and @DATE2 seasons when the plants are budding, so she believes that she will actually pass the drivers test when she feel comfortable, when the plants have budded.	2	2		2																					
1901	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes his story with an odd ending. ��when they come back,� Saeng vowed silently to herself,�in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again.�� I believe that beyond the literal meaning the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. By failing her driver�s test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. �She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home..� I believe that this is showing that she still didn�t consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past.       	3	3		3																					
1903	4	The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningfull. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, �I will take that test again.� By use of the word will, the author shows the girls determination. She didn�t say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new begginigs. The story quotes, �when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again. This shows that in spring, the new begginig of life she will take the test. This is why I believe the author ended the story this way.	2	2		2																					
1905	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its important when she says when geese returns and this hibisus is budding then she says she will take that test again and to tell the reader when she will take that test again. Thats way its in the story.	0	0		0																					
1906	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it emphasiseS that Saeng is willing to retake the test when it comes back. I also think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story the @NUM1 to last paragraph says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repititon of the season upon season, almost farmiliar to her now.� This sentence shows me that @PERSON1 is slowly getting used to the new place. Also how she is changing her mind about the pLant and the fact that even though its not the same, it can still have meaning. Therefore, I think the author made a good choice in ending the story with this paragraph.   	2	2		2																					
1907	4	The last paragraph states �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.� I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to state the fact when her new home is like her old home maybe she will feel more confident and more in her place, instead of cold winter total opposite of where she use to live. The feeling of her old home, in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then she will take the test feeling at home and pass.	1	2		2																					
1908	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that�s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can�t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. �She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now�. Saeng didn�t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won�t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her. �She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" With Saeng�s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1909	4	The authour meerly states the obvious within this story of shortness. This exerpt mainly mainly means that when spring arrives she will return to the Green house or area with all the plants. When she gets there, the girllwill atempt to act the plant that grews wild in her home country and bring it to her new home.	0	0		0																					
1910	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think he�s trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season  that was almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again	1	1		1																					
1911	4	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph because to show how Saeng fills. In the paragraph Saeng said ""I will take that test again"" means will I go throught the same stuff. Also @CAPS1"	1	1		1																					
1912	4	The author ends the story this way to show that there can always be a happy ending. The geese came back  and the girl was happ because of  it.	0	0		0																					
1918	4	The Author uses this paragraph to @CAPS1 the Story because it shows how Saeng wants to adapt to this country and she is allready beging to understand it and like it. When it @CAPS2 �and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� It is a metaphor about herself when the @CAPS3 begins to bloom and @CAPS4 Just as she is starting to bloom and @CAPS4. This is why the Author endeded with this passage.	1	1		1																					
1919	4	Saeng said that when the tree she bought starts budding she will take the test over. She means that without that plant she just does not feel like taking the test. She does not because the plant was with her, her whole life. She also thinks that she can not do it, without that plant. Saeng means that since she�s had a plant like that her whole life then she thinks she needs it, but I don�t think she really needs it. I guess it just �comforts� her.	1	1		1																					
1921	4	The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.	1	2		2																					
1922	4	After reading the story �Winter Hibiscus� by: Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a unique way that demonstrates a will to survive. For example in the text the author writes and explain how the plants �dok faeng-noi,� has adapted to its cold environment is different to the ones back at home. This demonstrates the idea of survival be the fact that in the past this plant migrated to a place that seemed warm at the time, but when cold streets, it found ways to change itself and adapt all based on the instinct to survive. Another example in the text is the author     Saeng telling herself that in the spring she will try and take the test again. This demonstrates the will to survive because when Saeng failed the test she felt a sense of meloncoly and failure. The fact that she had the courage to prepare for the test in spring shows how she human being wants to live and for her to live in a new country she must adapt by passing that test to become a survivor.	2	3		3																					
1925	4	The author choose this end to show that saeng hasn't given up on how she is living yet. It shows that even though she really loved her hometown, and feels and remembers a lot back then. She had taken the test and failed, living where she was living then just seemed too much pressure on her. Although she hasn't quite adapted throughly she will try her best to surcome situations that are brought upon her. It gives the reader hope by ending the story like this, instead of just leaving the reader at she bought a flower after failing a test and moves on with her life. For example when she failed the test she seemed distressed and very angry. I,�I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. For a long moment mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shedding it to bits.�it anger Saeng how she had to leave her happy past life for one that is different and challenging. When faced with a challenge extreme emotiona situations occur. Saeng just needed hope and the author choose this to betray to then reader there is a chance of hope!	3	3		3																					
1926	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus the author minfong to ends the story as she does for many reasons.	0	0		0																					
1928	4	"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again�. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."	1	1		1																					
1930	4	She vowed this because just as the geese would return she shall. also as the test themselves to learn and grow she would. Furthermore she @CAPS1 the the test of love, survial and family tridition she would know that comeing. back was destiny. In example they come to raise their young for the journey that they shall face and Help them to  realise that they always will come back because their lives started there and to always exacpe cold and man kind that wants to harm their lives. The winter months are very harsh there so They know that they have to leave just to @CAPS2. She learns the lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival.	1	1		1																					
1932	4	The author concludes the story like this because the seasons are changing and there finising there cycle and starting a new one. Thus I think this is a good way to end a story like this because I kinda sets a mood and a feel at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
1933	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story, adjusting to changed in life. So many things have changed for Saeng and she hasn�t full adjusted yet to the way of life. Yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like Hibiscus. The text states, �In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding� The hibiscus teaches Saeng to never give up, like the hibiscus doesn�t give up and survives during the winter. She learns to be determined and even though she failed the test the first time, her memories have helped her and she is going to go for it again. These ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place. She has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought.	3	2		3																					
1934	4	To set a tone and to talk about how they look. Also that little paragraph can also start another book or to get you into studing things. It could also compare Your life with the geeses life. Like explaning what hardships you went through.	1	1		1																					
1936	4	The author concluded like that because he was the one to score the lines below what you write. Score of to level and key better. To all the thing he was surprised to kindly be seprated by for there by up so blese geve one a high sew o of will sweit all at you up to the end of the authrs concludes 	0	0		0																					
1941	4	The author concludes the story with this type of paragraph because the author knows it�s bond to happen again. I know this because in that paragraph it says �in the spring����.I will take this test again�. She is just preparing herself for next year. This is why I think this paragraph ended with the story.	1	1		1																					
1942	4	Saeng was thinking to herself after dinner about the test. She knew that she can do much better than before. And she made a vowed to herself saying that once winter finally ends and spring start, she would take the test again, and this time she will pass it with flying colors.	1	1		1																					
1943	4	Saeng wants to take the test again when it is beautiful out and the hibiscus is buddy. The plant shows the beautiful achievement of passing the test. The plant will help her past the test by being strong, tough, and nicely finished. These characteristics reprecent the girl and the flower. The day was a good day and wants to take the test on the same day. The plant was strong and tought. This represents the girl in that time she didn�t pass. She told her mother and was very understandig about it. The plant represents beautiful things and the geese represent beautiful things. The girl wants to do that on that time of day and thinks she will get it next time. When she completes and past her test she wants to come home to the beautiful surroundings to remember that day. The author concluded with that statement to represent the importance of the plant and the surroundings of when she wants to past the test.	1	2		2																					
1944	4	"The author might have concluded the story with that paragraph, because she wanted to remind the reader how sincearl, ""Saeng"" was to the hibiscus flower. I say this because through out the story @PERSON1 was very compassionate about the flower. I think she felt as through she could relate to the flower."	1	1		1																					
1945	4	The author ends with this paragraph because it symbolizes a new beggining, Saeng says, �I � I failed the test.� She is also really sad, she is making a commitment to get a fresh start on life, just like how the world does every spring. The theme of the story is when life seems hard take a new approach. She intends to retake the drivers test.	1	2		2																					
1948	4	The author ended the story with that because she is sad and she wants to give hope to the reader that you should never give up on any thing, always keep trying. Also it ends on a good note, if was like I stayed up in my @CAPS1 crying that would not be good ending. This ending gives hope to the reader and it also tells the reader to practice. This is because when spring comes a end the lady is going to practice driving so when she takes the test she want fail. Also the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy. So in conclusion that ending for story has a good choose for many reasons, like making the reader happy, giving the reader couage to never give up, end to practice something if you fail it the first time. Also to help your mother when she is planting or digging up plant,	2	2		2																					
1949	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to develop the theme and to project what the main character will do after she plants the hibiscus, I believe that the theme of this story is adjusting to changes in life and the author builds upon this theme in the final paragraph. In the ending paragraph, the author writes, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author demonstrates how Saeng learns to adjust when things change in her life. In this instance, Saeng fails her driver�s test and to deal with this setback, she buys a hibiscus to remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new start test once the geese ??? (THIS @CAPS1 IS @CAPS2)	2	2		2																					
1951	4	Saeng did not give up on herself. She said she would take it over again then she might pass it. You will not always pass on your first try it takes a while sometime. Saeng encourage you to never to give up just cause you did not get it on your first time. She also builds confidence in herself. That�s why the author concluded the story that way.	1	1		1																					
1955	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� the author concludes the story the way he does to show that Saeng isn�t giving up. In the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick. �Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work.� This quote shows that when she sees familiar plants she is reminded of home, so in the spring when her plant blooms she will see it and feel more comforting and more at home which will help her find the strength to pass the driving test. So as the plant blooms, so does her comfort level.	2	1		2																					
1956	4	What l think the author was talking abount snow and it was add outside for the bays matter and snow started to melted.	0	0		0																					
1957	4	He concluded the story with that sentence because it told that she learned a lesson in life. all the way back home where she originally came from she missed her friends ibet and seeing her mother work out in the garden durring this time of year when its cold. I guess there poor in one way. In conclusion the choose this sentence because it sounds like she learned a lesson in life and even starting all over again but with a better understanding in her learning.	1	1		1																					
1959	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is more will power because she loves the hibiscus and what other way to end the story that have her comparing he self to the hibiscus because when she say  �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is is saying now this snow is slowing down the hibiscus. So the fail is slowing her down. So she is going to be reading to prepare for when the spring comes when the hibiscus is budding then she will be budding too by passing her test.	1	2		2																					
1963	4	When she is ready and good she is saying she will take the test again. When she is ready and good and it is nice and beautiful out then she will have the confidence to take the test again. The author was trying to tell us how she felt about letting her mom down.	1	1		1																					
1964	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it's important to the story. Also it closes the story up. Its exploning that the girl is starting to adjust to the new area, and is going to try harder to get along well there. So by saying shes going to take the test again. It means shes going to look at it in a new way. The authur put this at the end trying to make sense of everything and show the girl had changed.	1	1		1																					
1969	4	Why I think she added this is because she needs time to grow like the plant before she takes the test again. Sometimes you need more time to pass your test. going through school teaches more than stuff we need to know it helps us grow up, and how to understand life. I know myself as a tenth grader that I understand life more than I did in first. She still has a lot of growing mentaly about her past and preasnt.	1	1		1																					
1973	4	In the response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because this story was about a plant growing back every year around the same time. The paragraph ment like I think when the plant came back inspring & the geese would come back around it be another test of growing and not letting the plant die	0	0		0																					
1975	4	Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past.	2	2		2																					
1977	4	The Author concludes the story with this When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building then I will take that test again! because he or she are the ones who wrote the story. One information is her family moved to the united @ORGANIZATION1 from Vietnam. Second one is the Author could of made this story it was about her. Saeng fails her driving test.    	1	1		1																					
1984	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author end the story saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying no matter what Saeng failed the drive test the first time she is not gaving up till she pass and get her driving. The author also concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying that Saeng can wait till winter end so she see the hibiscus is budding.	2	1		2																					
1987	4	well It seems like to me that the reason why the author wrote that as his or her ending is because basically to have sarcaism and put emphesis on what he was saying and making it clear that he wasn't going to take the test again, and basically if some one would haft to kill him in order to make him take that test again.	0	0		0																					
1990	4	In the short story ��Winter Hibiscus,�� by Minfong Ho, a teenage girl fails a driving test but vows to take it again in the spring. The story was ended like this to show that the girl will have a new beginning. For example, ��When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again��(HO). The hibiscus is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland. So if the hibiscus is budding it is starting a new beginning she feels that she will be able to do the same. This is why the story ends like that.        	2	2		2																					
1993	4	The author includes that seterel paragraph because they wanted you to be able to visualize it in yor head rather than not seeing the picture. If you see a mental picture then it�s good at visualizeing.	0	0		0																					
1994	4	The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty.	1	1		1																					
1995	4	"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don�t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."	2	3		3																					
1996	4	The last paragraph of the �Winter Hibiscus� reads �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author ends with this statement to let the reader know that Saeng has hope and will continue to adjust to her new settling in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 the story, Saeng realizes that she is not as distant from her home in Vietnam as she believes. In the florists shops she sees �plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood worth. �The plants she grew up with exist in the @LOCATION2 as well. She fails �the test� by buying a winter hibiscus after breaking down crying, homesick. By the end of the story she recognizes that she is becoming more accustomed to her new life, which is �almost familiar to her now,� such as the geese flying overhead. The statement of the last paragraph means that by the spring, she hopes to no longer be homesick, and to think of the @LOCATION2 with its geese and winter hibiscuses as her home.	2	2		2																					
1998	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new begining is starting  For example the fact that they moved to a different country. Thats what the author means when the spring comes. Spring represents a new life which is what Saeng & her mother are doing. Also the snow represents a blanked of the past / hard times. Last but not least when the hibiscus starts to bud that also means a new beganing. So if you put it all together you get the hard times going away when the snow melts & then a new beginning when spring starts & the flower buds  That is why the author put this paragraph in the story because they needed a fresh start.	2	2		2																					
1999	4	They author had conclued that sentence to be the coucluding sentence because saeng thinks she deserve another chance at taking the garden test because she has failed the test before  then having her mother to be disappointed in her. And to what Saeng say at the end of the story is that she's gonna have more confidence in doing the garden test again.	1	1		1																					
2001	4	The author probably ends the story like that because it creates a sense of hope and wonder. I feel the story is essentially about over coming things. For example, Saeng had a driving test and failed it. She also seemed a bit overwhelmed by the thought of �home�. Saeng obviously cares about failing the test or she wouldn�t have put any time into thinking about it, which led her to a green house. At the green house she was looking for a specific plant to buy, which reminded her of home. Thinking of home and her grandmother upsets her. Saeng has almost this internal war with her-self and the author ends the story that way to end the story giving the reader a sense of hope for Saeng and wonder.	3	3		3																					
2003	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed to get a certain plant because it died but winter is over in spring is here it�s her chance to get that flower. For example in the story it says Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. It�s not her fault because in the story, it says the wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remarks of green and chicory weeds. The concludes because it will be a next time when you see Saeng again with a beautiful plant in her hand.	0	0		0																					
2004	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 the carter Saeng want to finish or @CAPS2 Take the Test agin when they come back and and also the author is @CAPS3 people @CAPS4't give up what you are doing with your self then she say that ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding Then I will take that test agin"" she means that she will not give up at all."	1	1		1																					
2006	4	The author wrote this paragraph at the end of the story to symbolize a fresh start. I think this because when it is spring and the hibiscus is budding it will remind her homeland and she will take a fresh start at the test.	1	1		1																					
2007	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has vowed to retake the test in the spring and will have more confidence when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding. �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eye now swept over her. � Saeng feels lonely because she is from a different country and misses everything she knew and loved. Now she has the hibiscus to remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
2008	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing."" You can tell at first the mother is disappointed & then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood. ""How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon? "" ""I�d love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."	1	2		2																					
2009	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of �Winter Hibiscus� means and this is why the author concluded it this way.	1	1		1																					
2010	4	"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: �I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."	2	2		2																					
2012	4	Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author uses the conclusion �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says �and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went� It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn�t pass her test she doesn�t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  	2	2		2																					
2013	4	Why the author concludes it because the author wants to show her that she won�t give up. that she will take the test again and try harder next time to overcome her challenge, and not give up. The author wants to show her, that she�s not a quitter, and she�s filled with determination even though she has conflicts.	1	1		1																					
2014	4	Why did the author conclude the story with this paragraph? I believe that the author concluded that paragraph because it tells what she is going to do in the future. For example in the story she told her mom �I failed�� When she was putting the flower in the hole by the garden a flock of geese were flying, heading south.	1	1		1																					
2016	4	"I think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it shows determination to pass the test. The test was to be able to make the garden graw. You know this because it says �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This shows that the test she look had to do with spring and the budding of flowers and that she is trying to grow something. In this story, they mention her helping her mother in the garden. So I think when the plants didn�t grow, she wanted to try again. That�s why I think they chose to end with the statement saying about taking the test again in the spring."	1	2		2																					
2017	4	The author uses this paragraph because it brings back memories from when Saeng put down the soil during the �winter hibiscus� and a flock of Canada geese flew by her. When Saeng failed her test the first time she did not dare look at her mother. She depended on the hibiscus which helped or want to retake the test but not until they re-bud again.	1	1		1																					
2018	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to conclude all the things they talked about in the story. In the story they talk about the spring time and now Saeng and her mother plants flowers and everything.	0	0		0																					
2021	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because that represents saeng�s decision to try again and to overcome obstacles in her way. It is used instead of her saying � I will try again next spring � to show diction and to show her goal or decision in a different way for example, It says �, Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now.� At first, geese flying in the sky was new to her, but now she�s use to it. Maybe the author is making a reference to the geese since it will be familiar (the driving test) and she will pass like she got use to and familiar with geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, she�s been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph is saying simply that she�ll take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtones the point in the story, which is to not give up and the will to survive.	3	3		3																					
2023	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He was talking for bout ho beautiful was nutura. He also thought sense Saeng loved nutura a lot she was going to go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the grarden taking care of the plant. That why I think the author dicide to finish with that paragraph it would probaly discribe how much he like nature. 	0	0		0																					
2024	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test.	3	3		3																					
2026	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about retaking the test to show that Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and even the smallest of things can hold memories for us. The paragraph shows Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2 by showing us that she isn�t going to give up on @LOCATION2 and that she will keep working at understanding our customs. The last paragraph also shows that our memories last forever by the hibiscus representing Vietnam and her home there. It also shows that she can start a new here just like the hibiscus does at her house. Finally the paragraph shows that even the smallest of things can hold our memories by the hibiscus representing her home in Vietnam. The hibiscus brings many memories back for Saeng and helps her cope with @LOCATION2. This is how the last paragraph shows us that Saeng is getting used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and the smallest things can hold memories.	2	2		2																					
2028	4	The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, �In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  	2	1		2																					
2030	4	"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. �In the story it says, �When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub� This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:� �when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.  "	3	3		3																					
2031	4	The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life. When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example she wrote �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.� This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation.	2	1		2																					
2034	4	The author is trying to communicate that Saeng will never give up and her confidence will grow so she can retake her test like the hibiscus in the spring. Comparing Saeng to the hibiscus plant in the last paragraph was to show how she will grow and advance to take the test again when it�s the right time. The snow melting represents her sorrows going away as the sun shows how she will succeed and grow like the hibiscus plant she had bought. The plant growing in the sunlight would represent her confidence to take the test next time, getting rid of the cold brisk snow which is like her negative self esteem and attitude. The author chose to compare Saeng to the plant in the last paragraph to show how it related to her life and attitude, and how her life will change in result of the hibiscus plant.	2	2		2																					
2039	4	They can compair the story and this statement to eachother because in the story the does not give up and the same thing with the test who even is taking to test again did not give up cause  they are taking it again.	1	1		1																					
2043	4	The author chose to conclude the last paragraph with the story to show that she has not given up. It shows that she has not given up because it says �overhead...geese...honk...familiar to Saeng now (second to last paragraph).� @CAPS1 when she buys the hibiscus, because, it holds many memories from home, to keep her going. Her mother still making an �omelet with slices of bitter melon� made her math water, @CAPS1 reminding her of home, gave her hope to not give up.	1	1		1																					
2044	4	Saeng love Flowers and plants. The Author concludes this paragraph in the stony because it go Along with the story. In the spring when the snow melts.Saeng waS waiting For winter to beover so she can see he plants and Flowers again. Saeng like the values of plants and enjoy planting them. The Author include that paragraph because he or she was showing how Saeng is so in love with plants. She couldn�t wait a new winter break was over.	0	0		0																					
2046	4	because she is confused and is not yet youst to the country she is in how so she can concentrat on her test as soon as the flower will plown because she feels more like home she thinks that she will do better on the test	1	1		1																					
2048	4	The author concludes the story by saying that when the geese come back in the spring then she will try to pass the test. So say that if at first you don�t sucede, try try again. Also the author concludes with that to show that Saeng has been in the @LOCATION2 for some years and that she still misses her home back in Vietnam.	1	1		1																					
2049	4	She thinks she is gonna pass the test because on spring becaus everything gets back on live againg flowers start growing again trees start to get green every thing starts to get Green the Geese are returning animals are starting to come out people go to the beach to distract their selve and that might be what she wan�t�s to do.	1	1		1																					
2052	4	I think the author includes this paragraph  in  the  story  because  it  makes  sence  the  geese  come  back  home  after  the  snow  melts  and  saeng  try�s  to  take  her  test  again  around  that  time.	1	1		1																					
2055	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because that is when she will take the test again. Also because the geese made her realize, that many of the things that she had thought were strange before had become familiar. Just like the geese. It was through the quiet repitition of season upon season.	1	1		1																					
2056	4	She ends with that paragraph because it starts over. When the geese came back and the hibiscus is budding its like restart and she can try again, dealing with her memories of home and her adaption to the new country. I think she will be able deal with it better and take it again, it shows that she wont give up.	1	2		2																					
2057	4	She says that because she had failed to keep the tropical plant a live.She was disappointed in herself and so  that  why  she  said. In  the  spring, when  the  snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this hibiscus is budding, then  I  will take  that  tes t again. When  she  failed  and her mother said it will be okay you can always try again.	1	1		1																					
2058	4	I believe that why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she is telling the reader and herself In my point of view that once again she do work in the garden to see if it catches her interest. I believe that the author is trying to express this because in the beggining of the story the author shows no interest in the garden or any interest of the world around her. For example when she was supposed to buy just seeds for the garden she went and used some of her mother�s money to buy herself a big mac. So In conclusion I believe that what I wrote clearly states how the author feels and why she ended they story the way she did.	1	1		1																					
2059	4	"The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the show melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because Saeng failed the test before and now she wants to pass the test. She learned a lot from her mother that day that completely changed her attitude towards life."	1	1		1																					
2061	4	The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story �Winter Hibiscus� on with the last paragraph  was due to in the story the girl went out on a test. And on this test which I do not know what the test is, she failed it and returns with a saebba hedge. This is a tamed plant for the family. The family loves this plant. They are what I understand from the story, newcomers to a country. And the country is @LOCATION1. They�ve moved here from Vietnam. She goes for her driving test and comes home failed. One of the things her mother asks, �why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could a had the famed bee-maags� which is the mother�s attempt to say a Big Mac which is their favorite fast food sandwich. But the reason why the daughter comes back with the plant is she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. �Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again.� She believes the next time she goes, she will pass the test and that she will not be ashamed of it and that she will make her parents proud by passing the test due to it is a high honor to the family, I believe, from what I am getting from this. In Vietnam not many people drive and that they want their daughter to earn this and it is something they do not have.	2	2		2																					
2062	4	It is clear that Saeng is in the midst of struggle during a time of homesickness after recently moving from Vietnam. But as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland. As Saeng moves through the story it is apparent that she longs for memories of her homeland, but is beginning to find new things to enjoy about her new home. For example, while she is touched by the memories aroused by the hibiscus flower, she is intrigued by the new experiences, such as eating Big @CAPS1 and new friends. While homesickness has caused her to struggle she knows that with time she will be able to overcome the obstacle of leaving the old ways, for the new without completely obliterating either. She is convinced that by spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the confidence to pursue any that will arise in her future.    	3	3		3																					
2066	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is saying when everything comes beet to the way they were she will do everything agein so thins aren�t the same as they used to be and she wants them to.	0	0		0																					
2067	4	The girl, Saeng , seems to be attached to nature and enjoy it when the spring comes like she said, a new natural intenill start and she will be motivated to take the test that she failed again. The author most likely finished with this paragraph to show that there will be hope for Saeng and she will do what she has to do to have comfortably in her new home country. The whole story talks about how she is still unsatisfied with her new home but it would be cut to and the stay with new chances and a new life, which they did using springtime to show this.	2	1		2																					
2070	4	The author in @LOCATION1 this because it is shows what is is going to do to he her gain failed and this story a what she must do get just from the geese	0	0		0																					
2073	4	I belive the author was saying a new start. I say this because of everything coming back. I also say it because Saeng knows whats important now and will take it seriously. That is what I think the author was saying at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2074	4	During  �Winter  Hibiscus�  written  by  Minfong  Ho, a young  girl  and  her  mother   to  a new place,and the  daughter  Saeng  is  having a hard time.Saeng found a plant called dok faeng-noi that reminds her of home. So  she bought it and took it home to show her mom, At first her mother was upset, she bought a @NUM1 dollar plant but then hearing her daughter is disappointment in herself, she found joy in the beautiful plant, while Saeng�s mother was cooking dinner .Saeng planted the beautiful plant and told herself when the  geese return, hibiscus is budding and its spring she will retake the test. She found strength in herself and  courage  to  do  better.  I think the author wanted to show how she gained respect for herself in the end of the passage. That is why the author ended it like she did.   	1	2		2																					
2076	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� written by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to sum it at all up. The author used this to keep the reader wondering too.	1	1		1																					
2078	4	Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, �� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. 	2	2		2																					
2080	4	The author of the story �winter Hibiscus�, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author wrote, �When they come back�in the spring� then I will take that test again�.(No). Saeng thought to herself and meant that she would move on in the spring. It also shows that Saeng could overcome failing the test. The narrative also states,��in the spring�when�this hibiscus is budding��(No). The season of spring means to symbolically start new and fresh. When the flower is budding, it is beginning a new life. Saeng is also starting fresh when she decides that she will take the test in the spring. Finally, this shows that Saeng could adopt to her new life by purchasing a familiar plant. The hibiscus helped her get through disappointing times. The geese also were a reminder that some things back home were the same. Minfong Ho concluded the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's adaptations. 	2	3		3																					
2085	4	 The author concludes the story with the sentence, ��when they come back  Saeng  vowed silently to her self in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again��. The story tells us most of the hard times and obstictes  Saeng has had to go through.

Saeng had a hard time trying to overcome these events and others. so I think this sentence was put at the end so the readers could see that see was going  to be ok, and overcome everything that happened know we know this special plant will help Saeng will future problems.     	2	2		2																					
2087	4	�Winter Hibiscus�, by Minfong Ho is a story about transition to @LOCATION1 and her own ability to be strong. Saeng failed her drivers test and was dissapointed as she walked home. She stops at a florist shop because she see's a plant that she thinks is like the one she had back home. Seeing this plant again makes her remember memories from her homeland. She plants it when she gets home and vows to take a driving test again. When the geese get back. The plant is like encouragment to her.	2	2		2																					
2088	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again she will do the same. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2089	4	I think the athor includes that becaus. she mite have faeled and need more time to study to get thing @NUM1 so other than that damn new	0	0		0																					
2090	4	The author uses this sentence to conclude the story to show that Saeng�s hope is restored. Throughout the story Saeng is sad and misses her home. She feels hopeless in this new land, the hibiscus reminds her of home and brings back memories of her being at home with her grandmother, which makes her want to be back at home. The author adds the part about the geese leaving because they also have to leave their home. The hibiscus is to symbolize her being strong and that she will make it through moving to just strange land.	2	2		2																					
2093	4	In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her �test�. But I know this because its says �Then I will take that test again� her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant. So in conclusion she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes just like the hibiscus. 	2	2		2																					
2096	4	He want to learn hibiscus spirits. Don't be afraid of fare. You just keep ahead, continuly to learn what you want, then you will success. like hibiscus has strong alive: fight with evironment. So, the author use this paragraph to conclude, the purpose is the Saeng will take this test again, like hibiscus will budding when spring's come	1	1		1																					
2100	4	Saeng vowed to herself that when the hibiscus begins to bud again she will take the test again. The hibiscus symbolizes hope to saeng that things can work out a second try. She concludes the story with the vow because, it expresses her last bit of hope. For example, the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country, with new surroundings but it also explains how she feels. She vows to show she won't give up despite of falling the first time. For example, �Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense , it was almost visceral �(Ho). This quote explains what the plant meant to her. This is why she concluded the story with a vow.  	2	2		2																					
2101	4	 The author ends the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s resolution. Her family had left a lot behind in Vietnam. She had the memory of her grandmother and hibiscus. edge. In the @LOCATION2 they are struggling as implied by the mothers reaction at the cost. The hibiscus she bought was away to comfort her. She thinks that if the plant can put up with the harsh winter environment she can do despite the differences in the @LOCATION2 and passing the drivers exam is something that many do and is a way to get used to her surroundings / fit in.	2	2		2																					
2104	4	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph to let readers known that Saeng is a survivor just like hibiscus. Saeng has not quite adapted to america and feels that this plant reminds her of home	1	1		1																					
2105	4	The author finishes it with this because spring time is a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test she wants to start over in the spring like the flowers do. To know that the hibiscus will grow back though now it is dying. For spring to come is a time to start a new, where babies are born, flowers are at blom and a new beggening is forming	1	1		1																					
2106	4	The concludes the sentence this way because their trying to show that Saeng is a very deterimined girl and no matter how many times she fails, she always trys again and again tell she gets it right. By doing this the author is showing what Saeng believes in and that is no matter how big or hard the chanellge is she will keep on going tell she is done what she started. Because moving was a very hard for her. She had a very hard time communicating with peolpe and just tyring to make friends cause it is not always easy be new, by moving she took a another look at things because they were different on her. But as time went by she got the hang of it so as long as you try you can be successful in it that�s what the author was trying to say by concluding it the way it was.	2	2		2																					
2109	4	It shows that she loves her plants. The story tells you all of the plants and how she likes them. She thinks they are all unique and that she enjoys the plants more than school or anything else.	0	0		0																					
2110	4	"Minfong who concludes "" Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph because it show @CAPS1's determination to succed in her new country despite the obstacles she faces. The winter hibiscus reminds Saeng to be strong like the hibiscus in is to endure winter or in Saeng's case to pass the driving test the text states ""....but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus ....""(Ho @NUM1). Saeng realizes she must also be ""strong"" lkie the ""winter hibiscus"" Saeng also realizes that she is beginning to adopt to the new country he wrote ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had though strange before had become almost familiar...""(Ho @NUM1).Saeng knows that she is able to adopt and is determined to succeed. Tthe author conclude.""..in the spring, the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho @NUM1) The ""spring "" will be Saeng's"	2	3		3																					
2111	4	"In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, by Minfong Ho the aurthe concluldes the story with the last paragraph because he's trying to say when the flower comes back to life and starts a new beginning that Saeng will start a new beginning by retaking the test. For example, �Look how root - bound it is, poor thing"". The example is saying how the plant was almost died when she bought it. Another example would be, ""I-I failed the test"". The example tells how she feels down about failing the test. So In @CAPS1 the flower was at it's �breaking point"" as well as saeng. The paragraph tells how @CAPS2 was going to take a break and wait for the flower to being stronger till she toke the test again."	1	2		2																					
2115	4	The author concludes this paragraph in the article because is the ron faldse in love with the plant and uses for a clock to tell her when she can take the test. It your not a @CAPS1.S citizen you can only take the driver�s test once a year.	1	1		1																					
2116	4	The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says �Saeng vowed silently to herself �which means she wants what is best for herself.	1	1		1																					
2117	4	Saeng believes that because she failed the driving test that she won�t be able the transition by a new country had she goes searching for her past. She finds her past in plants remembering Vietnam in deep sorrow. The narration states  �A were of less so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eye��(No) She remembers and misses everything she had she wanted her country her grandmother and her life. She came home to her mother with a plant and disappoint her mother with the cost but she understands the pain. The narration states �it�s a beautiful plant she finally said in sad you got it�(No). Eventually Saeng realizes how this plant affected her and how easily it survived and made a promise to herself. The narration states �and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agin   	2	3		3																					
2118	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus.� The author ends the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. To show or emphasize that if the hibiscus, a plant reminding her of her home, can over then so can she. In the story after the author had failed her driving test and was walking back home, seeing the flowers reminded her of home & connected her to her past making her felt less alone. For example, when the author says A wave of loss so deep & strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.� That shows that she misses her home and the flower gave her a way to move deeply connect to her memories, also when she says �like the geese the distinctive V against the sky.� That shows that the geese were kind of like her they were moving to a different place to start a new. Making her feel that if they can adapt and change so will she over time In conclusion the ending was to futher emphasize her feeling towards her hometown and the new town she lives in.	3	2		3																					
2120	4	Determination, help, strength � all are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with the paragraph. First, determination is a @CAPS1 why Saeng will go back and take the test again. Saeng failed her drivers test the frst time and she wants to wait and do it again. Shes determinated to take different steps in order to pass the test. Secondly, I beleieve that help is a @CAPS1 why the author concluded with that paragraph. Saeng will need help in order to pass the test and she beleives that the hibiscus plant will help her pass and help her to do other things. The author is proving that she�ll go back and she�ll be ready. Finally, strength is the last @CAPS1 why the author chose the paragraph to end the story. Saeng beleieves that the hibiscus plant will give her the strength to pass the test. The author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and she�ll be stranger than she was before. These are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	3	2		3																					
2122	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng changed. Saeng didn�t want to take the test and she had no confidence. In the story saengs mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for @MONEY1 because it reminded her of home. Now that Saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again. therefore Saeng has changed.	2	2		2																					
2125	4	The author probally ended with this to show the feeling that Saeng will return and help out again. So Saeng must like to plant. She probaly might hep his mom with alot more things now that she can see what helping might lead too.   	0	0		0																					
2126	4	In the story ��Winter Hibiscus,�� the author ends the story with Saeng �s thoughts. The thought of trying the test when the hibiscus starts budding ties the story together. The story is mainly about how she looks for a flower and the memories it brings. But she wouldn�t have gone to the shop if she passed the test. This creates a full understanding of the test and hibiscus. It also shows the importance of the hibiscus. Both Saeng and the flower must adapt to survive and are out of place. Saeng was from Vietnam and the flower was from a shop, both were moved from where they belong to a new place.In some ways Saeng is the flower. She must adapt to her home to survive. The flower, outside in the cold, must adapt to its surroundings in order to survive. When she knows the flower survived the harsh winter, she will realize that she can survive living in @LOCATION2. This would make her feel strong and focused. 	3	2		3																					
2133	4	She concludes the story with this paragraph because she want to let the readers of the story that she is not willing to give up and and that she is willing to take the test again and pass it.	1	1		1																					
2134	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she adapted her  new home. Also, it concludes the story so it shows the leader her last thoughts. So its like its, the  last thing , and subject  that  you  that  you  think  the author  concludes  the  story with  this  paragraph ,� when  they  come  back , in the spring , when the snows melt and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus is budding , then  I  will  take that  test  again.�	1	1		1																					
2138	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because show that she will go back to the one place and will not break down like that and grif over what she has lost and have to deal with change.	1	1		1																					
2139	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when it snows plants die and won�t grow back until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will she how her garden will be in the spring. Therefore the author put this paragraph in the end because Saeng loves gardening so much ever since she moved to the United States. Ever since the family moved to the United States the family has never been happier for being together having dinner and planting together they had the time of there life planting all the time.	1	1		1																					
2140	4	If you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you how comforting something can be that�s from your old country and in your knew one. The fact that Saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. Throughout the story it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house Many times in the story you could always �hear� that sense of love when she would call plant by its native languages name. Throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had. The author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her. Therefore that�s why he concluded the story as such. 	2	2		2																					
2144	4	The author concludes the story in this way to show that Saeng is a determined undividual. It is symbolic for when the geese return she will take the test again because when they left she had failed. The snow melting and the hibiscus budding show spring and spring is usually the start of a fresh and new begininig. The last paragraph its like a symbol for starting fresh. Saeng was upset about failing the test �She said, �I�I failed the test.� By stuttering that shows she was upset. Since she was upset giving it time until she takes the test again is good. The author ended the story with this paragraph to show Saeng is strong and will have a fresh and new start.	2	2		2																					
2145	4	I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn�t feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way.	2	1		2																					
2151	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus � this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as �The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.� The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is �strong enough to make it through the cold months here�. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that �many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her�. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom.	3	3		3																					
2153	4	The author concluded the story will this paragraph because she wants the readers to understand that she didn�t give up on the plant and that she�s determine. For example the story state that Saeng said �I-I failed the test,� She felt as though she didn�t accomplish what she wanted to. So at the end of the story she said �I will take that test again.� To show what kind of person she is and she not going to just give up just because she failed the first time.	2	1		2																					
2156	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The concludes the story with the paragraph above because it shows Saeng is a carring person to nature. I know this because of this quote, �one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.� This quote show that she cares for the little things in nature. Another quote that show Saeng is caring towards nature is, �she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.� This shows that Saeng is very caring to a small plant, which is part of nature. So in conclusion the author concluded the story with the paragraph above to show the Saeng is a carring person towards nature.	0	0		0																					
2157	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it helps to explain the significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus are very important to her and her culture. When there hibiscus around, Saeng feels that she can do anything. That is why she failed the test in the first place. So she is saying that the next time she takes the test, she will have the strength from the hibiscus to help her pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2159	4	The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she�ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant.	1	1		1																					
2160	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. because she wants to make a goal for herself in the future. She wants to pass the test, and she will try hard to do it next year. For example, her mother was mad she didn�t pass the test, but then soon forget about it. Saeng did not forget about failing the test. She vowed herself to the hibiscus because she loves that plant and will do anything for it.	1	1		1																					
2164	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted Saeng�s life and gave her new found courage and strength. For example, while on her way home after failing her driver�s test, Saeng sees a flower and says, �[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.� This shows the deep concentration between Saeng and the hibiscus and it is this connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently was into a flower shop and identified all the flower there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her knew life. Another example is when in the text it states, �She realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had become�almost familiar to her now.� Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big @CAPS1 here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength.  	3	3		3																					
2167	4	The author might conclude the story with this because it shows that the girl had confidence that when the flower blooms she will be able to pass. Back at her home land that flower mean't alot to her and it still does. But it seems like this flower gives her hope and pride. She used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair. So when she sees the flower, she will think of her grandmother and that will motivate her to keep going. The flower is strong and can stand through winter weather, so the girl is determinded that when the flower blooms, she will be able to past the test.	2	3		3																					
2169	4	The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom.	2	2		2																					
2170	4	"�then I will take that test again� [@NUM1] Saeng�s whole intention in the story was to take the test and pass it. Houever, ""I-@CAPS1] failed the test, [Ho, @NUM2] which brought the whole story together. She yearned for comfort as she seeked the �@CAPS2 Malik� [Ho, @NUM3] for comfort. Seeing this brought back all the memories of her life �back home� [@NUM1] that kept her going. As a result, bonding with her mother erupted, and it brought another day of hope for her future in her new home. Enough hope for her to say, �when they come back in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�"	1	2		2																					
2172	4	"The autor of ""winter Hibiscus"" conclded the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeg is going to give the test another try. The author wanted to slow that saeg was not going to giving up in that when the thing that was most important to her was complete that she would then take the test again. In the sory it says that ""saeg did not dare look at her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus is what was important t"	2	2		2																					
2175	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has overcome an obstacle in her life and that she is learning to move on. In the story Saeng is often stuck on past memories rather than making new ones. For example, when Saeng goes to the florist shop to purchase the plant, she starts remembering old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled �jasmine�, she thinks of her grandmother that died and remembers how she used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair. Also, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is �not a real one� and she also says it�s �not like the kind we had before.� @CAPS1, she keeps comparing her new life to her old life in her homeland and she does not allow her new experiences to be as good as her old ones. @CAPS1 when the author concludes the story with that paragraph, it shows growth in the girl, Saeng, and that she is willing to move on and make new memories, such as trying to pass her driving test again.	2	2		2																					
2176	4	The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because the story is coming to and end. The author putting that sweet touch on its saying it will become string again and the beautiful flowers will blossom. Letting the readers know that the nature will continue, The season will come back around.	0	0		0																					
2177	4	This paragraph @NUM1 includes to let the reader know it's winter. you know its winter because in the passage its says when the snow melt.	0	0		0																					
2178	4	" Tisaeng had failed her drivers test after she went to ""flour is it and bought� a plant it was the ""dok faeng � noi"", she had fond memories about the plant. She remembered it from Vietnam, and how it used to be everywhere all the time. She had bought �@CAPS1 hibiscus� as a comfort to herself. The  last paragraph says,� �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� Saeng figured out that things happen for a reason and opportunities occur over and over again. Just as the geese go south and @CAPS2 as the seasons change. She had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a change."	2	2		2																					
2184	4	She end, the story with that because the flower gives her strength. It gives her hope and reminds her of home. At her home they were every where, she had to buy this one. She planted it so it can grow through winter. After winter the flower gets huge and she passes her driver test. For reward her mom get her a real Vietnam flower.	1	1		1																					
2185	4	I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she know she was wrong and she want�s to make it up to her mother. Also she is showing her mother how much she really likes nature.	0	0		0																					
2187	4	I think the author used that response because she was showing that she had to go through another @DATE1 or hard work in planting flowers.	0	0		0																					
2195	4	The author concludes that statement at  the story at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng wont give up just like the hibiscus.For example the hibiscus does its  best to survive in the winter and blooms and starts over in the spring.Saeng will also survive the winter and star all over again in the spring and retake the test. The author  wanted  to  show  the readers that Saeng is the hibiscus in a way that she has to start over and retry what she has failed as if the hibiscus had died in the winter.	2	2		2																					
2196	4	My response is that if is about winter so realy it is going to be about witer walking around having fun and all them thing.	0	0		0																					
2197	4	The author concludes the story like that to make the reader more intrested and to understand it will all happen again and again year after year. 	1	1		1																					
2198	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he wants to show that the flower was her inspiration to take the test before. The way I got my response was, throughout the story, @PERSON1 was always either gardening the hibiscus or had one. This obviously showed me that she was inspired by this flower and its beuty. In conclusion, the author ends the story like this to show the importance of the Hibiscus flower to Saeng.	1	1		1																					
2199	4	The auther ends the story in this way because it represents the new brith that will take place. It�s almost as if she�s saying that she will hibernate during the winter, and when spring returns and everything begins a new cycle of life, then so will she. Saeng �realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through queit repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� She is saying that when the new season begins it will be her beginning and she�ll have a different outlook on her new life.	2	2		2																					
2203	4	The author concludes the story with When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because the hibiscus budding would symbolize starting over and Saeng taking the test again is giving her a chance to start over fresh and try again. The hibiscus doesn�t stop budding so Saeng shouldn�t stop trying!	2	1		2																					
2204	4	In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to say that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, @CAPS1 mother says �Its flowers aren�t pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months.� This is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months, in which the weather is rough. In Saeng�s case, she is a girl who will make it in a foreign country. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the drivers test again when the snow melts (writers over) and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph. 	3	3		3																					
2205	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has �tear stains and puffy eyes� as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test.	2	2		2																					
2206	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show the aduiance that Saeng @CAPS1 gave up so you should'nt either. I think that this paragraph is describin a law of life witch is �@CAPS1 give up.� @CAPS2 even though she had failed at first she is still willing to try again.	1	1		1																					
2207	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things	0	0		0																					
2210	4	This is a powerful sentence that demonstrates themes in the story. Saeng is determined to try again because she has been comforted by symbol of her homeland. This sentence shows what the plant has done for Saeng�s spirit and shows how that symbol helps heal her. The sentence is able to wrap up the story and demonstrates the importance of the hibiscus. In the story @CAPS1 describes the plant as a friend and remmeder of her homeland. Once she sees the plant in bloom she`ll know that she can take the test again. The paragraph is a great conclusion to the passage because it summarizes everything that the hibiscus has meant for Saeng.	2	2		2																					
2212	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hisbiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� because the paragraph its self concluded already. It basically sumed up what she was going to do all over again next time because she had already done it. What the author means by this paragraph is that when the plants come back in the spring she is going to have to do all the work again which was basically the test.	0	0		0																					
2213	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the readers know that she doesnt give up. They @MONTH1 have thought that she thaght the test back home were more important. So she wouldnt care about passing this test because she misses her home and wouldnt care about those test.	1	1		1																					
2216	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�, I think that the author concludes the story in �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is dudding, then I will take that test again� because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and make new flowers the Saeng should do the same. Therefore thats why the author added that quet to the end of the story	2	1		2																					
2220	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to show that the peace that the peace that the flower gave will build her confidence and she will not give up. I know this because in the story the main character fails her driving test and when she sees the flower it helps remind her of the home she had in Vietnam. Another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and it never stops blooming. She knows it will never give up and she relaizes that she shouldn�t either. Plus the plant gives her stength to try again. So the reason the author ends her story with that paragraph is to show the power the flower that was know to her, give her and how she will no give up.	2	2		2																					
2221	4	The author concludes the story with this ending paragraph because. It combine the two inpefect situations. When she said when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the gese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take test again. She will prove her point and abbreviated the situation.	0	0		0																					
2222	4	The author is saying that she would take the test again in the spring instead of the winter cause she would be more focus to just keep her mind on the test & not the planting.	0	0		0																					
2226	4	 The  author concludes with this because it had the most impact. The ending also gave the most meaning. The meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again, this could have a double meaning, and mean that the authors life will bloom again. Overall it was a good way to conclude the paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2227	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus"" I believe they end the story the way they did, �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� because with saeng making a goal, she�s overcoming her disappointment and uncomfort living in a new country. The archetyple meaning of a flower bud is: prosper, new, growth. This shows he growing and that�s important in life and that�s why the ended it the way they did. It�s a positive ending."	2	2		2																					
2228	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she realizes her connection to the hibiscus plant. All through the story Saeng thinks about native plants she�s seen before are now in @LOCATION1. She sees how they�re adapted to life there, like in the way the hibiscus can survive the winter. Saeng realizes that she also must adapt in her new home. She doesn�t necessarily need to adapt to survive, but to be successful. She vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding (restarting its growth cycle) she will restart too and retake the test.	2	3		3																					
2229	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the author�s final paragraph shows how much the hibiscus means to her. The author uses symbolism when, he talks about the hibiscus because it is a strong plant just like the girl needs to be to pass the driving test. The author put the paragraph at the end to show that if the hibiscus can come back, after winter, so can the girl. In conclusion, the author used the last paragraph to emphasize the meaning of the hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2231	4	The reason why the author concluded the story with that paragraph was because at basically explained everything You needed to know for the ending. It basically explains that she is willing to take the time to study for the test she had previously taken and did not pass and wants to take it again once spring arrives. For example, the geese had left for the winter. and once they return in the spring, she will take the test over again, in conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it best explains the ending of the story.	1	1		1																					
2234	4	Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower.	1	2		2																					
2236	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author concludes this story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has confidence to take the driving test.	1	1		1																					
2241	4	The story concludes with this paragraph for a number of reasons. First, in the spring it is warm and sunny and this helped to end the story in a happy note. Next this shows that Saeng can adapt to her new home, as the hibiscus will through winter. Finally, it shows Saeng is determined and won't let her mother down. That is why the story concludes with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2243	4	Authors often end stories with paragraph that make readers wonder what happens next. In Winter Hibiscus by: Minfong Ho there is an ending paragraph just like that. The author ends it like this because she is looking towards the future. She says that she will take the test when the snow melts, the gesse come back, and the hibiscus bluming. She is looking at it like that is a new beggining. She wants to start over. Also the gesse, blooming hibiscus, and melted show gives her hope that she will pass her test. She belives now they have a hibiscus maybe it will be more like where she use to live. Authors use endings that make people wonder so people think. 	2	1		2																					
2245	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the geese and the hibiscus were both things that were familiar to Saeng They remind her of her homeland,When  the familiar things return ,she will have the strength to the test again and hopefully do better.The narrator says �Overhead a of Canada geese flew by,their faint hunks clear and �yes-fimiliar to Saeng now �.This shows how the geese are a symbol of the fimilar things from her homeland that help Saeng feel more comfortable in her new home.	1	2		2																					
2246	4	The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant makes her think of where she is from and helps her to succeed a certain things. I know that the hibiscus is from her homeland because in the story she says �I mean, not like the kind we had at�at-�, she found that she was still to shaky to say the words at home.� She misses being home and this plant helps her bring back memorys of being there. Therefore the author included that paragraph to show the reader that she misses her homeland.	1	1		1																					
2248	4	"The author concludes this story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, whe the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take the test again"". She does this because in the story this plant has given her a lot of beilef in herself to @MONTH1 be do better in the future."	1	1		1																					
2250	4	In order to get over her failure, Saeng bought a flower that reminded her of home. Saeng�s started to cry when she bought the flower. She wanted to be back home. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show how she will take the test when she feels like she is at home. �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� Saeng said to herself. Those things make her feel welcome and feeling that way will help her with her test. The paragraph concludes the story with all the things she is comfertable with. This conclusion helps the reader understand what reminds her of home. Also explains how much the hibiscus flower ment to her. Buying the flower helps her with her troubles. Seeing the geese fly reminds her of her home. The author concludes the story with the memories that will help Saeng in the future.	2	2		2																					
2251	4	I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because, every one should have fresh starts, or second chances. I guess the author was leaving in a message stating if you fail once you should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test it seems as though her self-esteem lowered, and her mother tried cheering her up, and eventually she realized it will be bad giving up and not trying again with a fresh start.	1	1		1																					
2252	4	"Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. when saeng saw the hibiscus she got a feeling ""so intense, it was almost visceral.� The flower was creatively used by Ho. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph, that this flower must give saeng hope and confidence. Also, the geese make a V which I infured would mean Vietnam to saeng which is what the author is trying to get her reader to think. That is why �and the geese return.� is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants her readers to realize that objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author did a great job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the lesson, and that is that you should do things when you feel confident and it feels like home to you. You @MONTH1 be small and fragile, but if you �plant� yourself you can thrive with confidence. "	2	3		3																					
2253	4	The last paragraph at the end of the story was the authors way of showing how Saeng wanted spring to come early because she wants to see her hibiscus. If spring doesn�t come fast she will not get to see her hibiscus and the snow won�t melt. When Saeng comes up she hopes she can take the test.	1	1		1																					
2254	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn�t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."	2	2		2																					
2255	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story.	2	2		2																					
2257	4	The author concludes with with paragraph because Saeng has to take the test all over. She @MONTH1 think theres a better chance when it blooms and the snow melts. So that is when Saeng is going to try and take the test after the snow melts and the hibiscus blooms	1	1		1																					
2260	4	I think that the author concludes the story like that because @MONTH1 be she�s saying that by that time she�ll be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @MONTH1 be by that time when that happens in spring she would be preprared and more confident of herself. @MONTH1 be the author was trying to say that just like the begining of a new springs, it would be a new beginning for her.	2	1		2																					
2261	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2264	4	It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, �This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader.	2	3		3																					
2265	4	Including the bit about taking the test again when the �hidiscus is budding� provides a sense of closeur and lesson to an otherwise open ending. Saeng fails the drivers test early in the story, then on her way home she buys a hibiscus. The reader really doesn�t see a connection until this last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perserverence and strength. After a harsh winter this hibiscus can bloom again and ard continue to live. Even after moving from Vietnam, and struggling to adapt, Saeng must recover, ard keep trying. Just like the flower blooming again, so will Saeng. She will take the test a second time and pass. She will adapt to her environment, and keep going, just like the hibiscus.	3	2		3																					
2266	4	The  author concludes  the  story  with  the  paragraph  � When  they  come  back  ,  Saeng  vowed  silently  to  herself  in  the  spring  ,  when  the   snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is  budding  ,  the  I  will  take  the   test  again ,�  because  the  author  started  out  the  story  after  Saeng  failed  her  driving  test  .  Saeng  is  reminded  from  the  Hibiscus  about  her  homeland.  After  Saeng  wanted  the  Hibiscus  in  the  garden  ,�  a  flock  it  canada geese  flow by �,  as  they  flew  by  Saeng  felt  a  sign  at  comfort  and  vowed  to  herself  what  started  everything  .  If  Saeng  did  pass  the  driving  test  then  she  would  of  never  found  the  Hibiscus.	1	2		2																					
2268	4	In think the author is trying to show that Saeng is finally starting to accept and get over the struggles in the life. It is showing that she has finally gotten used to @LOCATION1 and the customs, but she still hasn�t forgotten her heritage. �But she had herself much preferred it to a big Mac.� It also proves that she is going to be positive and not let disc overage her. She�s going to retake it and try again. During the beginning look on her situations in life. But after visiting the floral shop, she discovers a more cherry. Optimistic outlook on her situation and decides to do something about it.	2	2		2																					
2269	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because she�s concluding that the winter is there, and when winter is over, she is going to start flowering and planting again. In the story it said, �the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,�.� So, now she has to wait for winter to pass by then the hibiscus will be starting to grow and will hopefully be alone by spring. So, that is why I think she concluded the story the way she did.	0	0		0																					
2270	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of what about her test? Needed to be answered and that�s when she'd to comfortable to take it. In the text. To her, the plant felt smooth and cool just as she had known it, which was comforting. She closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, with sadness, and maybe disapointment, which she probably word want to deal with for a while, hinted at in the conclusion her mother even uttered a small cry of surprise and delight to see the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid all of over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I believe that she will be more comfortable at the time. planned because she'll have new and old things to come home to, such as the geese and plant.                	2	1		2																					
2273	4	The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.	1	1		1																					
2274	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It�s explaining moments in time. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is.	0	0		0																					
2277	4	In the story I don�t know why the author and the story with that I really don�t know, maybe she was talking about she took all test now she wouldn�t take it over again atey. The times come. She in school and when one took the test of was that kind of wealth now that of not of is @DATE1 and school is over. 	0	0		0																					
2278	4	Why the author concludes this paragraph into the story is because at the end off the story they needed and ending. Also why is because the picked and conclusion that would best fit this story.	0	0		0																					
2279	4	I believe that the author chose to conclude the story the way they did because the story was about perserverance. For example, the story was baised around the winter hibscus plant. This is a good example because in the end Saeng vows that she will perserveer and take her test again and the hibiscus perserveers and forges through the winter not allowing itself to die. Another example that @CAPS1 mother worked outside while it was cold to get her gardening done. This relates to the story because her stayed out in the cold garden to get her job done, she could have quit and gone inside the nice warm house, just like Saeng could have quit and said she was not going to try to take her test agin. But she did not, she said she was going to try again. 	2	3		3																					
2280	4	I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,� In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .� mean that when all is @CAPS1 .� She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don�t even know what she  failed  so I didn�t  like it.	1	1		1																					
2281	4	I think the reason why the author ended the story with this �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.� paragraph because like this the plant didn�t have a fight chance for survival in the winter and was same with the girl when she took her driving test but in spring the plant has chance bloom so she has a chance to pass the test because because there time and place for everything.	1	1		1																					
2282	4	"Emotion, camitmint, hope, all are reasons why the author ended the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the gees return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1, that last paragraph shows that she has emotion. Next, It shows that she has comitmint, she says that when the hibiscus coms back she will take the test again. Lastly, it shows that there is hope and the she will try and redeam herself. These are all the reasons why she used the last paragraph."	2	1		2																					
2283	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, �she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her.� At this point she has an epiphany, and realizes that life is like seasons. In the end paragraph she intercedes this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times. One day her time will come for her to �bloom.� @CAPS1 experiences hard times, but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to �bloom.� 	3	2		3																					
2284	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because, he wanted to show that she wasn�t going to give up just because she failed one time. She failed the test one time already. She was very sad about it. She went and bought a plant. Saeng�s mom told her that they were going to do it the right way. Saeng was crying when she told her mom about it. Her mom was very understanding thought. Her  mom could have been very mad with her. She could of used a plant that they grew. The plant @MONTH1 not grow right now. She should of bought a real plant from someone else.	1	1		1																					
2286	4	The author of � Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho end the story with the statement, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again,� because it showed that Saeng had overcome her problem and vowed to correct it. By ending with this statement the author showed that the beauty of nature can help one to overcome their problems, as did Saeng. Upon seeing the Geese  mignitry and the �Winter  Hibiscus� Saeng, �realized that many of the things that she had thought  of as strange before had become, through the guiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.� Saeng realized that the test although strange and different to her now became familiar because of her experiences with nature. Seeing the geese and �Winter Hibiscus�. This plant also made Saeng think of her past in Vietnam and all of one good times back at her home. �The familiar  fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could  almost fast the light strures of her grandmothers long gray hair, freshly mashed.� The jolont made her think of good experiences. In the plant made her joyous enough not to think about past, but about the future, about taking the test again and her new life in the United States   	3	3		3																					
2287	4	The reason why the author puts that last line into the story of the end is to show us the raids  and saeng  that even though us almost over. She doesn�t want  it to end but she know that it will also start up again. Next year when things goes back to the way they were before everything changed. This is why I think the author put that line into the story.	0	0		0																					
2288	4	The author concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again� to express her determination of fitting into new things and to express the change she was getting used to. Describing spring was important in the conclusion because it described what Saeng once thought was odd in @LOCATION1, but got used to the seasons and weather changing. Once she realized that she needed to deal with change, she knew that she would need to try the driving test again. It was very important that the author�s conclusion was �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because it expressed how Saeng was accepting change in her life.  	2	2		2																					
2292	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she overcame and she wants to re take the quiz for herself and to prove it to herself no one else. she states �when they come back, saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. So she says that she wants to retake the test. So she is not being pressured into taking it. She is taking it to prove to herself no one else.	1	2		2																					
2293	4	"In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, a young girl named saeng recalls her life before she moved to @LOCATION1 .She misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng vowed to take her drivers test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason. He/She wants to show that saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. Saeng�s mother states, ""�it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months�. That�s what matters"". The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months."	2	3		3																					
2296	4	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold so she would wait until the snow melts and geese return to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother.	0	0		0																					
2297	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and in the spring she will take the test over.	1	1		1																					
2298	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you�ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way.	2	2		2																					
2299	4	Saeng was taking a test and she didn�t quite pass it She was afraid to tell to her mother but she has to tell her anyway. Her mother got upset because she didn�t pass it. Saeng knows  that right after winter's over, She�ll be taking that same test again and she hoped she will pass it this time.	1	1		1																					
2301	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story Saeng went to take a driving test but didn�t pass and so she goes and buys a hibiscus that reminds her of home and gives her strength and comfort. So her mother says this at the end because she knows Saeng is going through a hard time adapting to her new country and she doesn�t want to put more pressure on her just because she knows Saeng is very upset and is trying to make it up to her by buy a flower for her so she says by next spring she should be adapted and ready for the test because the flower should give her hope. She wants her to know she is three for her.	1	2		2																					
2302	4	I think the author of �Winter Hibiscus� said �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.� to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn�t giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way.	1	1		1																					
2303	4	The author of the Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with the paragraph to show the connection between the hibiscus and @CAPS1. The hibiscus has to survive the winter until spring were it can bloom and became big and beautiful. @CAPS1 is connecting to the flower and saying she can make it through her obstacles that come with the change in enviroment if the flower can deal with being confined in a plastic container and surviving the weather. She feels that right now she's likes the Hibiscus. She�s trapped because the area is alien to her and she has to adjust. Just as the container is alien to the flower because it�s used to being free. But once it�s planted, it will become a part of it's surroundings and grow. And once she accepts the change and becomes willing to start over, she will begin to grow and that will cause her driving test to be easier. In conclusion, this is the reason the author concluded the paragraph with this sentence.	3	3		3																					
2307	4	The author concludes this the story with this paragraph   because its start a whole new  day time . That saying  means  that  she  will  take  the  test on a budding  new day .for  example, the   geese  return  her its spring and  hibiscus budd  and  she  has the test  in  the spring  so it  will  start  why the author concludes the  story  with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2308	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the driving test in spring time. Spring time is a symbol of positive feelingsshe gets positive feelings from the blooming of the winter hibiscus.	1	1		1																					
2309	4	They had to come back so they did and they were walking into an then world over there in the corner and the childhood world to just as she had known it would feel.	0	0		0																					
2310	4	This last paragraph is written for several reasons. First, she will try again when she feels the time is right. Just like the geese coming back, Saeng will comebak to take the test, and so the Hibiscus plant will also bloom again. She feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test. This pharagraph describes Saeng well about how she lives and how she will take the test again when she feelsit is right.	2	1		2																					
2311	4	"I believe that the author ends because the author is showing that Saeng is determined to pass the test. ""She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes. ""(Ho) This quote shows that passing the test meant a lot to Saeng. She was crying because she couldn't help but buy the plant and fail the test. She didn't want to fail and showed her sadness by crying.� then I will take the test again.� (Ho) This quote shows that even though she failed, she is determined to pass the test and succeed. Failing hurt her greatly. so she can't wait to do it again and pass because she is determing to succeed. This is all important because Saeng shows that determination is the key to success and she is determined."	1	2		2																					
2312	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story to show saeng determination and her adaption to her new home. This shows her determination because it say �I will take that test again."" This also shows that she has adapt to her new home."	1	1		1																					
2314	4	"In the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph with Saeng vowing she will take the test again in the spring. Minfong used this paragraph because it means never give up, even if you fail the first time. For example, Saeng just failed her drivers test but after buying the Hibiscus and taking deeper into things she realized she shouldn�t give up."	1	2		2																					
2317	4	The author concludes the story with a paragraph so the people reading the story would actually read it and not guess how the story is goin to go.	0	0		0																					
2320	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test.	2	1		2																					
2325	4	The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal. It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think.	1	1		1																					
2326	4	I think the author add this paragraph because it a sign of a new start for her. Because she has hard time no doesn�t main the she will alway have hard times.	0	0		0																					
2328	4	"Authors sometimes use intisting sentences as there concludy sentence that you @MONTH1 have a hard time understding. In the story �Winter Hibiscus� The author concludes her story by saying �when they come back. Saeng vowed siletly to herself, iN the sprng, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author says this to show that Saeng is not ready to gardam yet and needs to lean more. The mother is verry disapointed in the daghter for buying a plant that is very expensve and shows her inexperience in that buying thigs because of your fodings is wrong. This is showed wha they say �I paid over Nineteen dollars for it."" � You what?� She also, says � @CAPS1 facing. Na where did you gott that"" showing her suprise of the expensve beutiful plant. Authes use those paragraphs and sentences to show or recap the story. The Author of �winter hibiscus� @CAPS2 her story with the paragraph because Saeng shuld Not hav boght the plant bascal a hav emotions and that she shall try agan Next year to not mess up."	1	1		1																					
2329	4	The  author  of  the  passage  ends  the  story  with this  statements  to  creates curiosity. Thi creates curiosity through writing for the spring and the geese to return.Spring is the beginning for many creatures on  the earth  therefore ,Saeng  is  trying  to  start  over  because  she  must  wait  for  the spring. The hibiscus reinforces the feeling of a new beginningin that each year new bad grow just  like  she can have a second chance. Saeng  waits for  the  spring  because she knows that is when every thing else creates new life so Saeng must wait till then to get her new beginning	2	2		2																					
2330	4	I think the reason why the author ended the story with that paragraph was because that will be the time she thinks she will be ready to retake the driver�s test. Before she made that move she was dishearted because she failed the test. Maybe she picked the spring time because that gives her time to get herself together and practice between them and the spring time 	1	1		1																					
2335	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, Ho concludes the story with the paragraph due to the fact the flower represents her hapiness from her home. The flower symbolizes the past and comfort, once Saeng began to dig the ""winter hibiscus"" In, ""she could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now,"" All of Saeng�s sense were beginning to return; she was happy, likewise, the author uses the geese to explain the comfort of Saeng. The country around her began to feel like home. She became familiar with her surroundings. Many references to home was made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness. therefore, Saeng would gain more confidence, which explans the reason @CAPS1 Ho concluded with that sentence."	3	2		3																					
2338	4	"The author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story. �I will  take that test again,� This is the test that she had failed that day. The test that she failed tested her memory of her home. Her old country was so important to her. The part in the quote,� when they come back.... when the show me it and the geese return,� is referring to when she says,� She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become � almost familiar to her. Like the geese,� She is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to like the geese that fly south every winter.� When she uses ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" she is saying how she will remember all the things she has forgotten when she moved over here to this country.� When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center �just as she had known it would feel. This whole statement is basically saying  that she is starting to forget things in her country as this country becomes more familiar but when the geese return meaning in the @DATE1 then she will remember again and she will take that test again of her knowledge and pass."	1	2		2																					
2339	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he/she is trying to put across the message that the plant shows a symbol of new beginings which is a symbol of saeng�s vowe. Also in the story caring for the plant teaches saeng responsablity in obtaining her license by care for the plant it will teach her patients and that she needs to learn from mistakes made.	1	1		1																					
2340	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng had failed her drivers test and was very unhappy. She also disliked her new home. �She was still too shaky to say at home� she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up. After talking to her mother, it renewed her hopes so the author uses this paragraph to signify that she still have hope in the end and when she is ready she will try again. �When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.�  	2	1		2																					
2341	4	The author concludes this in the story to show tone. The paragraph shows how Saeng was determined to try again a pass. This teaches a lesson to the reader. Lessons to try your hardestand don�t give up. The last paragraph ends the story with a sence of curiosity. It makes you want to no more or if she passes.	1	1		1																					
2342	4	I think that the concluding paragraph means after everything   else   important and what is meant to happen happens then she will take the test because its  basically the last  thing has to happen and I think she will pass it because it meant to happen.	1	1		1																					
2345	4	The author concludes the story with the afore mentioned paragraph to represent the connection between the return of the hibiscus�s bids, and the return of Saeng�s resolve. In the photograph for question #@NUM1, the hibiscus flower is out of place, as if it doesn�t belong similar to Saeng. The hibiscus represented the link to Saeng�s past, as portrayed when the author writes: �Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.� The hibiscus was native to her homeland, and by helping Saeng to remember her past, she began to cope with the present, and later the future, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.	2	2		2																					
2349	4	In the passage �winter hibiscus� the author uses this phrase in the last paragraph �when they came back, Saeng vowes silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. I believe she concluded this story with these words she change because she is saying to you in that means when the birds flewaway. Even the bird seasons would be back like always. An example of this is when she says the birds eased into the hibiscus. Mingled because the last paragraph thinking that she would stay again next season and keys very what she likes to do. This what I get out as the last paragraph are the story �winter hibiscus� as what it means to me.	2	1		2																					
2351	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show saeng�s determination to survive and be happy in her new home. Although she isn�t happy with her purchase she is trying to make it seem more homey. When  she says �will take that test again�she shows how she wants her surroundings to be comfortable. By ending with this paragraph it also shows a strongness in seasons. As it saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring. This paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends. The  plant is like a symbol of how she is going to change she is going to investigate and pass her own test proving she diserves to be happy and make herself feel at home.	2	2		2																					
2353	4	The author in this story explaynes how hard some changes can be. The author also explayns how family and object frome home such as the flower can be comforting. The meaning of the story is to show one of the author expierances in life.	1	1		1																					
2354	4	I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it wasn�t it for the little girl and she wasn�t going to give up on planting flower and that when the spring come and the snow had melt she was going to plant some more flower and see how they will do during the spring even though that it didn�t work as well as the winter season she did let her stop her I think the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesn�t work keep on trying maybe something different will happen.	0	0		0																					
2356	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One reason is because It leaves you knowing that Saeng will never give up tring. Another reason is that something as simple as a flower can encourage someone to keep going even if they have nothing to go for. Saeng says that flower is something so important, that working harder will encourage her to keep doing the best she can. The author leaves you with this sentence because it is very powerful and brings Saeng courage.  	2	1		2																					
2357	4	The author concludes the story with this because she failed the test already and wanted to pass it nexttime So she doesn't make her mother dissapointed in her.	1	1		1																					
2362	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how she will start over by retaking the test, just as the hibiscus will start over by budding new flowers. Saeng shows us how she will try to overcome the obstacles she must face, just like the hibiscus flower and geese will overcome the winter. In the story, the author makes the hibiscus represent the way to adjust to the changes in life. In a way, the winter hibiscus represents Saeng because the flower is adapting to circumstances, the circumstance being winter. Just like the hibiscus flower, Saeng must overcome her obstacles of being in a new country, and retaking her drivers exam.	2	2		2																					
2367	4	The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng�s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother �s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past . When she  isn�t  home she said � I failed the test .� This snows melt she want is to move on but it hasn�t  as  easy as she hope it to be. So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal.	1	2		2																					
2375	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� because it shows That Saeng isn�t going to stay down. It shows That The hibiscus will overcome winter, like Saeng�s mother says,�'�but its strong enough to make it Through the cold months here, This winter hibiscus That�s what matters.� This symbolizes Saeng overcoming not only failing The driver�s test, but also moving to @LOCATION1. She isn�t The same as she was back home, but she�s strong enough to get Through This change in her life. Also, taking The test in the spring symbolizes starting over, when everyThing is new, and she has overcome her winter. This ending paragraph is so important because it shows Saeng�s promise to herself That she will get past The challenges in front of her, and @CAPS1 to come. When Saeng says �...When the snows melt...� it symbolizes The time in her life when her failures will become good again. She will take The test with a new out look on her life. The author concludes The story with This paragraph because it shows That Saeng isn�t going to stay down.	3	3		3																					
2378	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story it says ""I will take that test again."" So she's trying to say she will she how much she have adjusted to changes in life. In the story it also states ""when they come back"" That concludes that when the flower's come back next season. She will she how much she reminber about her homeland, her grandma and the good things."	1	1		1																					
2380	4	Now that she knows a lot about plants the narrator makes it seem like the girl is interested in @CAPS1.R.@CAPS1. The new world and different plants that bloom and look so beautiful in the season so the way I see it is that the girl really enjoys the plants and the characteristic to me I say she is an adventurous girl who likes to explore new worlds and see what is out there to be explained.	0	0		0																					
2381	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome. What the @CAPS1 �In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� It means she�ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she�s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it.	1	1		1																					
2382	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl. By vowing to take the �test� again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality.	1	1		1																					
2383	4	Minfong Ho concluded the story with this because it shows Saeng�s determination to pass the drivers test. The fact that she failed it made her feel bad, and brought out feelings of homesickness as did the familiar plant, but in this final paragraph she vows that she will overcome all her challenges of being in an unfimiliar place and pull herself together to accomplish her goal as did the winter hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2388	4	The  reason  the author was inspired was because of the flower. The flower had the ability to survive harsh winters and adapt to and new environments. She decides that she was going to over comes its obstacles just as the flower over comes its obstacles every winter.	2	1		2																					
2389	4	Memory,promise,life-all are ideas that explain why the author concludes the  story with this paragraph.Memories is one  idea that helps explain why the author concludes this story  with  this paragraph because saeng misses her old life and country.Promise is another idea because saeng makes a vow that once spring comes again she will take the test again.Life is another idea because saeng brought the flower and planted soit can live once spring has come and she said  the n she will  retake the test. Memories, promise, and life help explain why the author conclude the story with this paragraph. Memories will come back in the spring along with the promises she has made and the that wants to start and saeng is doing this by pla nting the hibiscus which brings back a lot of her memories from her life	2	2		2																					
2391	4	Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes the becus she was vary eger on passing the test. She told her self and she vowed to take the test again when the geese return and the snow melsts. Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story.	1	1		1																					
2393	4	The author does this because they are comparing to the plant. The author does this because when the plant starts to bloom then the character�s confidence will come back. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it gives the story some meaning.	1	1		1																					
2394	4	The Author concludes this story With the @CAPS1 paragraph to emphasize the story and make it seem more interesting as to make the reader want the story to keep going on to find out what happens next.	1	1		1																					
2398	4	In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel.	0	0		0																					
2399	4	Because they wanted to get it done with so they made the end like the first part of the story I like the part when the birds came back they got some of the flower come back to them.	0	0		0																					
2403	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined. For example, saeng failed her driver�s test but upon reaching the hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her old home. Also, while she is planting the plant, she sees the geese with a new familiarity. This combined makes her determined to complete her test because having two reminders of both homes, it comforts her to know that she can adapt easily and treasure her memories as well.	3	2		3																					
2404	4	he was saying that you should not give up and that you should keep trying like the plants in the spring time.	1	1		1																					
2405	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself.	1	1		1																					
2407	4	The author decided to finish the story with that phrase to show that she will wait for her next year and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and prove that she can do it one more time and that she is used to live there now.	0	0		0																					
2409	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will try the test again and get a fresh new start.  Also I think that its showing the reader if you fail something the first time don�t be afraid to go back and try it again. I also think that the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the test in the winter and doesn�t like what shes in. But in the spring when the hibiscus has buds on it shes going to have a fresh start on the test and the flower will have a new environment to survive in.	1	2		2																					
2410	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn�t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that�s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things.	1	1		1																					
2413	4	This last paragraph reveals something special to the reader. Saeng was given new hope winter mothers understanding and the hibiscus plant. She felt hopeless, miserable and incomparable upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland. When she came home, however, seeing the roots of the plant buried in the ground gave her new determination. The flower represents her. It adapted to be able to survive in cold weather, or hard times, in Saeng's case. The roots are her past and although they are buried, they are not forgotten. The actual flower represents a new life for Saeng in a new country .The author, Minfong Ho, gave personification or human�izing to non-living things to the story. This is why the author used the last paragraph then why she did.	3	2		3																					
2415	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" Saeng finds comfort in the plant after she failed her test. The plant reminds her of home and connects her with her past experiances. Even though she failed the test the first time she feels that if she studies and trys again she can pass. This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again. Saeng feels a connection with the plants rebirth and feels she can start over again to and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng vowes to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms."	2	2		2																					
2417	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as a way to say that in due season she will take the test that she failed in the belief that the hibiscus will help her to overcome the obstacles. I believe that she she bought the plant when she failed the test, that she hope that with the blossoming of the plant, I will give her a time table as to when she is ready to try again.	1	2		2																					
2418	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story. Everything that happed to Saeng  while she was at the florizd  is summed upinto  something resembling vengeance. The whole reason that Saeng was sad in the first place was that she failed her driving test. In the final paragraph, she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus that Saeng  bought will begin budding in the spring, when the snows melt. The last paragraph of the story gives roem for Saeng to dealhtith her nostalgiaover the winter season. Finally, the  geese that fly south make Saeng feel sad, but they light a spark within her she tells herself that she will take the driving test again when the geese return, when the hibiscus buds, and when the snows melt. 	2	2		2																					
2420	4	"I think the author of �Winter Hibiscus� finished with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, �because it is showing us the importance of the plant and how it will help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return� the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says �Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance�. This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again�, because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started."	3	3		3																					
2421	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has meaning. The author is saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance she too, will get hers. For example, the geese will get to return, the hibiscus will get it's chance to bud and she will get her chance to take her drivers test. I know this because Saeng�s mother starts talking about how great the plant will be in the spring. She even says, �But its strong enough to make it through the cold months�. This indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance. That is why the story ends with that sentence.	2	2		2																					
2423	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. ��in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words.	2	2		2																					
2426	4	The author wrote the paragraph because she went back in side the house to get a dinner and because ain�t going to see the garden until the other day and because the winter come and she will not play outside anymore until the winter goes. Like she said �In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. That quotation explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2430	4	The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now.	0	0		0																					
2432	4	The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that.	2	2		2																					
2434	4	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that�s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story	1	1		1																					
2436	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus"", the auther finishes the story with this last paragraph, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again. The auther finishes the story with that paragraph because in the beginning, Saeng had purchased hibiscus plant because it had reminded her of her hometown. (�Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world�) So she purchased it, but since there was bad weather at the time, Saeng had to get the plant back in time and plant it in the graden. But she failed setting if there on time. That is why it says �I will take that test again"". And she will take it again during the spring when the hibiscus blooms once again. That is why the auther finished the story with that paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2437	4	The author concludes the paragraph like this because it shows that she @MONTH1 not going to give up. I @MONTH1 this because she vowed silently to herself that she was going to take the test again during the spring, also, it was the aiudieres not the gains in old years seeds an ezing. In conclusion they one the reason why the author concludes the paragraph like this.	1	1		1																					
2438	4	"The story �Winter Hibiscus� is written by Minfong Ho. The author ended the story with this excerpt, �When they come back, �Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The reason for this is so she will have time to adjust. Saeng just needs a little comforting because all of this is new to her. This words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself, �Almost familiar to her now. Like geese.""

2446	4	I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is �almost familiar to her now� (@NUM1).	1	2		2																					
2447	4	The author concludes with this ending because it because it gives hope. It is like a happy ending to a sad story. It is also her final thought for the story and a good end point.	1	1		1																					
2449	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, �I failed the test,� (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence.	1	2		2																					
2451	4	The author concludes the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show that she will try again with a new start. When she see�s the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus. The hibiscus brings back memories of her childhood. She then takes it home and shows the plant to her mother. Her mother replies with a �You what?� hearing her daughter tell her how much it is. With the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope. By saying she will start once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she means she will try again with a new and frash start.	2	1		2																					
2453	4	"The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because it appeared to be an important thought to ""Saeng"" and it was basically the main cause of everything rather the main subject of the story. She also @MONTH1 possibly have concluded the story with that particular paragraph because that was her last and final thought, or memory of her previous life / lifestyle before there present place of living."""	0	0		0																					
2456	4	The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time �when the shows me�. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, �Saeng  brokedown and wept!� The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the �show will melt� and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as �yet another old friend�. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage.	3	3		3																					
2457	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� ends the story with this paragraph because it reveals the importance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the story Saeng moves from Vietnam and feels very homesick. She fails her drivers test and is very upset. When she sees the familiar plant she is reminded of her home in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus reminds Saeng of fond memories with her grandmother and simple things such as her fine. Toothed buffalo-horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water. When seeing the familiar plant. �Saeng felt a shock recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. �This shows how important the hibiscus was to her. The author ended the story with that paragraph to show how the winter hibiscus is a comfort to Saeng and will encourage her to do better on her next driver�s test.	2	2		2																					
2459	4	The author concluds the story with this paragraph to show that next spring she will have anoter chane. The author shows that Saeng will relate to the blooms or the hybiscus plant and take the test again. The author does this to leave a clif haber and it shows there is more to Saeng�s life but it is still to come. In the story Saeng is trys to get used to change and that she is have a hard time. Her moter holes cheer her up but just like the winter comes. Saeng will Have next spring to take the divers test again.	1	2		2																					
2460	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph ""When they come back,� then I will take the test again because Saeng needs time just as the hibiscus to grow. Saeng didn't do well on a test but says she will try again after snow melts and the spring comes. After moving Saeng feels alone and wants to go back home but she feels in her heart that she can try given time. The hibiscus remines Saeng of the flower back in her home country this helps her see that she has to let go of her past and live in the now."	2	2		2																					
2461	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows saeng being mature about it and being confident knowing she can take it again. When it says � saeng vowed silently to herself she thought about everything and the phrase is almost like she is going to start over.	1	1		1																					
2463	4	Saeng was happy when the snow was disappearing because she couldn�t wait for spring to come back to see the animals running around by her garden and seeing the beautiful geese flying in after they long & hard hibernation. So Saeng was excited to see everything grown back so she is guaranteed to pass the test this time	0	0		0																					
2464	4	 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time.	1	1		1																					
2467	4	The author ends with this paragraph to show gthat Saeng had. Hope. It shows that there is still hope. The ending paragraph makes you  kind of create your own ending for Saeng. I like to imagine Saeng with a big garden next to her and and she passes the test.	1	1		1																					
2471	4	when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. That is in there for many reasons. One is because when winter comes and brings all the snow it kills her garden. So thats why she wants it to be spring again so she can start growing things agian in her garden. She got to take a test on the things that she is growing to make sure it is @CAPS1 for someone to eat it. Thats why I think the paragraph �when the come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	0	0		0																					
2472	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it.	2	2		2																					
2473	4	The Hibiscus is budding means that the flower was growing. That is a flower with lots of bright colors and nothing else can beat it. The reason another flower can�t beat it is because that flower represents so much thing and it is one of the most natural born flowers around.	1	1		1																					
2474	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was how he wanted the story to end. He wanted to end the story with her talking to herself.	0	0		0																					
2477	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show her determination. When she says. ��when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Saeng is explaining how the geese have the determination to fly back and that the hibiscus has the determination to bud again so why shouldn�t she have the determination and confidence to take the test again. Saeng said, �I-I failed the test.� It seems as if failing the driving test made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country. But after she saw the geese�s and hibiscus�s determination through harsh conditions, she was determined to try the test again.	2	2		2																					
2479	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things from her home and living, it will comfort her in what she does. The author seems like she needs things from her homeland that help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of earlier life. I think that whenever I want to do a good job It helps to think of the good  things that mean alot to me so I will be happy and want to do good. The author is smart to want to see those things for her to retake her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again it will be good luck for her.	2	2		2																					
2480	4	The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driver�s test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, �aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her. �Through the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. �The pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng�s mouth watered,�, �The winter hibiscus� was in the ground now�, and, �overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and � yes � Familiar to Saeng now.� This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saeng�s newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to thrive in it. 	3	3		3																					
2483	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. In the story there are some quotes to support my response �I-I failed the test� Saeng said.� This shows that she was taking a test about gardening. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life of it to them. The paragraph talks about spring, and flowers. The daughter and mother live off of the plants by planting vetagables, and fruits.	0	0		0																					
2485	4	Saeng was very distrout knowing that she didn�t passed the test the test and to her she felt as though it was a let down or disappointment. This sentence shows the ambition and determination that Saeng has so that she will be able to pass this test.	1	1		1																					
2489	4	I think the author includes this because she doesn�t want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then �I will take the test again.� This quote is saying she @MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you don�t no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng @MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.	2	2		2																					
2490	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 @NUM1. When the author write all those things in nature that will happen it symbolized re-birth and a fresh start, a new chance and that is what Saeng needs with her drivers license. The author put powerfully. Put those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a sense of roundness and end with that last paragraph, the story is complete.	2	1		2																					
2492	4	I believe the author of �winter Hibiscus �ends the story like she did because saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test.  Saeng states in the story �it�s the flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, thes winte hibiscus. That�s what matters.� I think saeng is using this as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam. She plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol. She will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring.	2	1		2																					
2494	4	I the narrator this paragraph in the story because hibiscus is a valueable plant and garden is you own decision if you like to grow things like her mother grow hot pepper. Garden is a way to @CAPS1 different like the different types of foods you can plant and the different plants in the world there eg @CAPS2, lilis, and other other plants like that.	0	0		0																					
2495	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver�s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle.	1	1		1																					
2497	4	She ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to let everyone know she feels most comfortable in the spring. It also states that she can not wait for the geese and the hibiscus to start budding because it is her favorite time of the year.	1	1		1																					
2499	4	I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back.	0	0		0																					
2500	4	The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to, a place where she didn�t like and knew No one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what don�t give up, have faith. At the end Saeng has faith in herself that she can past the test next time. She @MONTH1 have realized that just because your at place you don�t want to, it doesn�t mean you can�t go on.	1	2		2																					
2502	4	I think That The author concludes the story with This paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there. By saying shell do the test again shows that she doesnt want to let ths defeat her in her new home and her new life.	2	1		2																					
2503	4	The author concludes saeng vow in the story to show that saeng can and does have the ability to overcome obstacle. Saeng  feels like she is a failer. Her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her driving test that she failed. The geese represent survial and to never give up, to keep trying your hardest to success.	2	1		2																					
2505	4	The author ends the story with  �When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. � A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eye now swept over her.� She wants to be able to handle the loss better. The author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over.      	2	2		2																					
2509	4	Saeng's peRsonality in this stoRy shows deteRmination and confident. I think she feels that she could do moRe experienced things on different plants. I also think this is a peRfect hobby experience foR someone who loves Plants. I feel that Saeng @MONTH1 have accomplished heR goals of planting. I think she @MONTH1 want to puRsue heR career in gaRdenning. When she stated that when the plants come back aRound, she would take the test again. I think she means that, she is willing to exploRe more plants. I think she @MONTH1 have got this experience of planting fRom heR motheR. To me this @MONTH1 have been a family tradition. Saeng will pRobably have kids and teach them about different types of floweRs.	1	1		1																					
2510	4	The author ended the story with the paragraph in order to show that Saeng is looking forward into her life and with a positive outlook. It shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore. The hibiscus is used as a device for this story�s plot. When changes happen with the hibiscus, changes happen in the story. At first, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she plans it, things start to look up. She begins to accept the change when the last paragraph says, �when they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� it shows that Saeng is looking at her future positively, and with this positive change, the hibiscus is now beginning to bloom. The author concludes the story in a symbolic way that helps express the story�s themes.	3	2		3																					
2511	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph �Saeng vowed silently to herself� because she Saeng wants to do in proper time and season. �winter season�, the land or soil was so cold that plants was not able to grow properly. �Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars�, and she Saeng failed the test. �There was frail, wiry beauty to her Saeng mother that touched Saeng deeply�, she Saeng mother is shining when she worked to plants. These all are the description that concludes in the past which want to make correction and shine like her mother and also to pass the test.  	1	1		1																					
2513	4	The author is trying to convey a sense of hope for Saeng in her new country. After noting that she failed her test, which is probably a citizenship test, the author wants to conclude the story with something that reasures the reader. It is obvious that this test was important because Saeng could not even look her mother in the eye. This was probably why she bought the flower for her mother. The ending reasures the reader so that you don�t wonder how it will workout for Saeng.	1	1		1																					
2515	4	The Author was trying to end the story quick thats why he ended it with this one.	0	0		0																					
2518	4	The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2519	4	This paragraph means when winter is over and the geese come back from the south, and she favorite plant comes back that used to be in her old country, she will try what she was trying to do before but this time she has more confidence. This is what I think this means.	1	1		1																					
2523	4	She said this too show the determination it takes to make it no matter how many times you fail you need to get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this way also, it takes alot for someone to fail something and to get back up and try again on it. She isnt willing to accept failure, and she's trying to redeem her failure so she says she'll try again. That is why she ended the story that way.	1	1		1																					
2524	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author did this so that people who read the story will know what she is gonna do next spring and they might make out another storie in so that you will know that she will take the test in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2527	4	The author concludes the story with that because she want's to retake the test. Because she wants to pass the test for her mother. So she brought home the flower to apologize to her mother.	1	1		1																					
2529	4	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.	2	2		2																					
2530	4	when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself In the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibicus budding then I will take that test again	1	1		1																					
2531	4	In �@CAPS1 Hibiscus� by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. �And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. �She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.� She can�t say home because home isn�t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion�s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does	3	3		3																					
2534	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home.	1	1		1																					
2535	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese because it shows how Saeng, like the geese, will adopt to her new environment. It shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do. She will take the test again and will not give up. The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, �� she noticed the tearstains on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes�[No]. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and that she does not like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, ��she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac�[Ho]. This proves how even though she @MONTH1 not like things at times, Saeng is willing to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, ��she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now �[@NUM1].Saeng is getting more and more used to her surrounding and is adopting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese.	3	3		3																					
2536	4	The reason why the author wrote the conclusion paragraph was to show that Saeng is looking forward to a brighter future. Saeng is hoping to see the geese once more that remind her of her homeland and that see wants to pass the driving. In this story I feel as though Saeng is a very sentimental person and so that is why I think that is reason the author wrote the conclusion paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2540	4	Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said �yes| when she planted the hibiscus.	0	0		0																					
2541	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story was mostly talking about the hibiscus. Saeng was saying that when it�s spring and this hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. The hibiscus reminded her of her homeland in the past.	1	1		1																					
2543	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind because she found  a  flower that reminds her of homeland. She is afraid that her parents  are going to be mad at for not passing the test, therefore she  buys  a  flower  that she sees for it remind. When she gets home and telling her mom how much she paid for the flower  and  how  she  didn�t  pass, mother is upset for only a second, then she is understanding of what her  daughter is going throgh. By the end  of the story she has  more confidence  that  she  will succeed next time.	2	2		2																					
2545	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again. The author wants to tell the reader because she fail the test she know what she did wrong and shes going to correct. For example when Saeng said, �then I will take that test again.� Saeng feel sorry she fail a simple test so she wants to retake the test when the snow melts.	1	1		1																					
2547	4	The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One reason is to show Saeng is not going to give up and keep trying to pass her test. Another way is to show that even though your life has changed that don�t mean that you have to give up. These are some of the way that the author concludes the story like he does.	1	1		1																					
2548	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they wanted to show that she is comited to her nature especially to The hibiscus. She thought that the hibiscus was special because of what she did with it. Like when they said �she reached out and touched petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velet toward the centre�. And that�s why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.  	1	1		1																					
2549	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng feels like that will be the right time to take over her driving test over and when the hibiscus is budding. And another reason would be because the authors wants to show her determination,	1	1		1																					
2550	4	She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring.	1	2		2																					
2551	4	Why I think the auther concludes the last paragraph in the story because it's kind of like a moral to the story. Shes trying to say that when the time is right she will try it again untill she gets it right. Without this last paragraph you wouldn't be able to understand the message of the story.	0	0		0																					
2552	4	Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom she makes things the author made that the ending sentence to make the story more intresting for the read ond to keep thom heoked to the end	0	0		0																					
2553	4	The authoR concludes the stoRy with that sentence b/c she wanted to explain to you that she will do this again when the hibiscus is back in season.	1	1		1																					
2555	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means that when she gets older and gets more confidence then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready just like the hibiscus will be ready to start to budding again.	1	1		1																					
2558	4	The author includes  this sentence in  the paragraph  because  it�s  the  start  of  a  new  beginning.	1	1		1																					
2559	4	In the story the author concludes with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think she did that to say that you shouldn�t give up. In the story Saeng goes to the store and �touched a petal.� She buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home. In this way it seems Saeng is willing to give up her memories of her past. When she brings home the plant and her mom and her plant it in the garden. I think Saeng is trying to make her new home like her old.	2	2		2																					
2560	4	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. This is done to symbolize the many things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were �strange before [and] had become familiar to her now�. The hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed. The last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learnt.	2	2		2																					
2562	4	The reason why I belive the author concluded the story like that, is because, she is going going to aways start over. For instants in the story she said I�I failed the test. From that known she throught she was going to give up. So that is why I belive he ended the story with that line	1	1		1																					
2564	4	She means that when she return she is going to do the same thing again and see if she will do better or not.	0	0		0																					
2569	4	By adding this paragraph to the end of the story, it show that a resolution was made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heartbroken however, after buying the hibiscus, she had found hope and motivation and decides, in the end, that she will take the test again, �in the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. Its to help move the story to a conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this. Readers are able to abtein the message as the story from paragraphs like this. In this case, the author�s message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things. It is important to know what a author is trying to tell the reader through paragraphs as not only a reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express their ideas clearly to an audience.	2	2		2																					
2570	4	I think that the author uses this quote, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.� @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. �But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?� �BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.� @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable. 	3	3		3																					
2571	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. In the sping time the hibiscus grows just like Saeng. When Saeng got to the new place she was small and peuney just like the plant. �Its leaves quavering in the wind"" (@NUM1). This quote tells us the the plant was weak a peuney. If the plant was strong it would not be quivering. The fact that Saeng brokedown and bought the plant tells us she was not strong. And at the end the author uses that paragraph to tell the reader that the hibiscus is strong and so is Saeng and the can over come anything."	2	2		2																					
2572	4	The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says �Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, �� and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. 	2	2		2																					
2573	4	In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.	1	1		1																					
2576	4	The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, with the strong paragraph of one sentence starting that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This sentence leaves the reader in suspense while incorporating the main point of the story and combining them to express an idea about what might happen in a continuation on the future of @CAPS1 and this story. After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort her mother and her-self. While she stood watching the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng�s feelings to stay determined and take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a string sentence which not only summerized the story, but left a cliff hangs.	3	2		3																					
2578	4	In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story �Winter Hibiscus�. In the story the young girl finishes of by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says �Saeng vowed silently to herself� but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last �vowe� is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girls determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says �and this hibiscus is budding� its showing the girls connection with the plant because of the comfort and canfidence it given her, ecpecially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl was with her the flower and the homeland.	2	2		2																					
2580	4	After they come Saeng  was  silently  to herself , In the spring , when the snows melt  and  the geese return and  the hibiscus  is Saeng  then  I am  take that test again.  She  say this sentence she is herself back to home .She  thinks  it familiar to Saeng  was. She  is herself  how  quiet it vowed  to  so  every season . Her live is very quiet and leavy . She feels  as  of place .  Due to failing her driving test things herself  was thing for her to united state was so different from vietnam and she expresses  her  feelings  will she talk a about this something flower.   	1	1		1																					
2582	4	He concludes this story like that so you dont feel as if she was defeated. She is now more aware or believes she can complete the task. Also she has more selfconcious in herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home.	1	1		1																					
2584	4	"The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of realization, and new beginnig for Saeng. She spent so much time missing the past, that she didn�t know how to enjoy the present, which theme-wise the author is saying �live in the moment�. The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said,""It's strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that�s what matters. the author is say ultimately that tough times are irevitable, so hold on to the moments that make you smile, for they will help you perservere through the times that are tough."	3	2		3																					
2587	4	The author ends the story �Winter Hibiscus� with the passage �When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time. I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her home land so she thought when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. The plant made her think positivly. And insted of thinking she will fail she is thinking she will pass the next time. I also think Saeng felt comforting her when she was upset and I think that helped her feel alot better.	2	2		2																					
2588	4	The author concludes this story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver�s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, �That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?� Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,��in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   	3	3		3																					
2589	4	There is why the author ended the story with this paragraph. It mean that when she comes back after winter she will repeat her tasks all over. For example she will dig, sen flowers, their customers. Then when winter comes again she will do it all over. So has steally the other is using different words to say when winter ends she will repeat her actions. That is why the author ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2591	4	The author conconcludes the story with this paragraph because, the plant brings back memories to Saeng and she is sort of like the plant. Saeng can be compared to the plant by, she is starting out in a new area that she is unfamiliar with, as well as the plant. The plant is now being planted in the soil outside of her house and has to grow. Saeng has to learn to grow aswell and get better and prepare to take the test again. So when the plant is grown and adapted Saeng believes she will be grown and adapted too. In conclusion, this paragraph is a perfect ending for the story �Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho.	2	2		2																					
2592	4	I think that the author ends this story with that paragraph to some up what the story was all about and to also say that Saeng would try the test again. In the story it says �she realised that many of the thing that she had thought of as strange before had become, though the quiet repetition of season opon reason, almost familiar to her now and this last paragraph help bring all this together.	1	2		2																					
2593	4	A vow is a good ending, she vowed to take the test again because she failed it. It expresses how she feels and she made a commitment to pass. The author wanted to show a lot of feeling and how desprite she was. So she saw tons of beauty to keep her going.	1	1		1																					
2594	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself,� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She buys the flower because she failed the drivers test. She has seen the familiar plant on her way home as she went to a florist shop to try to buy one. The flower makes her happy and reminds her of home. The author ends the story the way he does because it leaves hope, so that the story doesn't end sad. She still has hope of passing the drivers test."	1	2		2																					
2597	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting.	0	0		0																					
2598	4	Saeng  ment  that she will take that test  next  spring and pass it with the hope of her winter flower  and  the  sight of her flock of geese  she  has high hopes that she will pass her test . when  she sees buds  on her hibiscus then she will take the test again. Saeng was very upset when she failed it the @CAPS1 time and she was hoping  she  passed  next  spring.	1	1		1																					
2599	4	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has new. found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her."	2	2		2																					
2600	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, �It�s flowers aren�t pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. �It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng should be strong even I times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, throught the quiet repition of season upon season�� It shows that saeng realized that the new place that she�s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home � In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be  strong and follow the flow of life.	1	2		2																					
2601	4	�In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibisus is budding, then I will take that test again� Saeng thinks to herself. Saeng finds herself in a new place were she has no friends. She finds comfort in a plant shop one day when she comes apon a Hibiscus flower. The flower calms her spierit and helps her beguin to adjust to the changes in her life at this time.	2	1		2																					
2603	4	The author ends it with that paragraph because the girl is talking about when the @DATE1 or spring comes again she will try again. The author ends it with that because it explains how the girl feels about spring and the animals. The girl says allot about the geese in the story, so we know from that she likes animals.	1	1		1																					
2605	4	In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose the to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, �when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. Saeng�s situation is similar to the flower�s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home   	3	3		3																					
2606	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph (when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again) because it explains what she is going to do when winter is over. Also to keep the readers guessing on what�s going to happen, to Saeng and her mother. Another reason is to have a new story when winter is over.	1	1		1																					
2607	4	I know the reason why the author concludes the story the way he dose and  it is a good reason . It says that since she failed this year next year when it is time to ready up the garden she will tell again . That is a good moral because you have to keep trying and trying to succeed   because even if you fail you are not losing any  progress. It is like what @PERSON1 had happen to him even though it took him @DATE1 tries to successfully  make the light bulb he simply said � I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb . So I do agree with this author and how he ended the story.  	1	1		1																					
2608	4	She does this to show her strugle with her gardeding struggle. It is like this because ech year she has to work on her garden because the winter blowes it away meaning it kills it.	0	0		0																					
2609	4	The author ending the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng wont give up. Saeng wants to make her mother proud so she is gonna try to do whatever it takes. All Saeng trys to do is make her mother happy. When she failed her mother was disappointed. Then suprisingly understanding. When Saeng told her mother she failed Saeng started to cry, but then her mother wiped the tears away.	1	2		2																					
2610	4	ThE author concludEs the story with this paragraph bEcausE mEans that whEn thE shovEl grow again in the spring, whEn thE snow mElts and the gEEsE rEturn and this hibiscus is budding shE will takE thE tEst again. So shE will wait until thE nExt spring to takE thE tEst..	1	1		1																					
2611	4	In the story the test was if she could overcome her homesickness. When she want to the greenhouse all of the. plants and flower brought back memories of her homeland. When she saw the flower it reminded her of the times life she would get water from the well and and a flower was floating in it. So after the winter she would go back to the place and see if she was still homesick. I feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again  	3	3		3																					
2615	4	At the end of the essay �Winter Hibiscus� by @CAPS1 Ho, it ends in a positive manner. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason why I think that the author decided to put that there, was to show how Saeng felt about her country. So when the country that she is has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring. Which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test. Thats why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay.	2	1		2																					
2616	4	Saeng promises herself that  �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agan.� The hibiscus is meta phorica to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of her homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, �that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become� almost familiar to her now.� She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable.	1	1		1																					
2621	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself �I will take that test again,� shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng�s good character. It shows Saeng�s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	1	2		2																					
2623	4	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agian."", to show that the hibiscus plant has given Saeng hope. It has helped he get threw some rough and difficult times. In the story Saeng has just failed her @CAPS1 test and had to walk home. She was very upset. On her way home Saeng saw a familiar flower. She had walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen. The employee pointed her towards the flower. The hibiscus brought back many memories at her hometown in vietnam. Saeng planted her flowers in the vegtable garden. That flower had given her hope. She is ready to try the @CAPS1 test again."	2	2		2																					
2631	4	The reason why the author of the story ended the story like that is because after all the hard time that plant went through, it will still bad at the end of the winter. The author said that the plant will take that test again that test is surviving through the could winter and blunming at the end of the winter	1	1		1																					
2635	4	Explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Cause it all make a little cent to concludes the story with this. Here why I think it does. The paragraph in the one of the main pieces to to the story. �In the spring, when the snows melt and after return,� all she say is is when the snow is gone and the grass come back, I will start planting again and she would be happy with it, �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again,� she went to put her plants up again and tests them to see how them over so she can do them even again. Saeng loved this plant so much that she can�t wait. But when it does she is going to plant a lot. That what the paragraph is saying Saeng is going to wait so he can plant a hibiscus. However, since she came to United States she loved the flower that very much.	0	0		0																					
2638	4	Several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life. Also when the hibiscus starts budding she will feel conforted, as though it auomaticaly brings back her childhood memories. It also is a link to her past home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again. Its as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, she will also be ready.     	2	2		2																					
2642	4	"In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng makes a vow to herself. �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� this vow means that she will start fresh, make changes, and adapt to her new life. She want disappoint her mother and she wont be broken down by her memories. She concluded the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now."	2	1		2																					
2644	4	The author concludes the story with this last paragraph because it shows by spring she will be ready to retake her test. It shows that like the geese who care and come back, she will have time to study and pass her test. In the story the author includes this last paragraph to truly show her dedication to eventually grow to be comfortable in her new home and to pass her drivers test all in good time. Saeng wants to be comfortable with her new life but isn�t yet because of what one misses. But she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter. This was a very effective way to end the story because it really communicated Saeng�s message of dedication and longing to overcome her obstacles, her new home and driving.  	2	3		3																					
2646	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determind story. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2648	4	The author coNcludes the story with this paragraph because she was tryiNg to say siNce the hibiscus is plaNted we are goiNg to see how it does with the winter. ANd wheN spriNg arrives and it's still staNdiNg she caN go take the test. I thiNk the author was compariNg the hibiscus to their life aNd obstacles they will go through, so if the hibiscus is still staNdiNg theN that meaNs everythiNg will be fiNe to where she caN go back aNd take the test.	1	2		2																					
2649	4	The last paragraph of �Winter Hibiscus� describes determination and the growth of a person. Saeng says that when �this hibiscus is budding,  then I will take that test again.� Just as the hibiscus blooms Saeng will bloom forth and strive through the winter to try and succeed in passing her test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she can�t be sad forever. She must be determined in order to pass the test. The next season will be a sort of renewal, starting fresh and coming out beautiful as does a hibiscus in bloom.	2	2		2																					
2650	4	"The Author of �Winter Hibiscus�, Minfong Ho, concluded hes story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will take her drivers test again, because she wanted to end on a happy note. In the begining of the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2, failed her drivers test. She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. �I mean it�s not like the kind we had at � at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� (Ho, @NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else."	2	2		2																					
2651	4	"The author concludes the story with these paragraph for a very good reason. In away she just letting it go and will wait to take it again. I think that is a good that she found the flower. That is because it let her and her mother and in away make her better. For example when it say's"" the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."	1	1		1																					
2652	4	The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. It show a small amount of newfound confidence Saeng now has. This ending also shows how much of an effect the �Winter hibiscus� had on her. with bringing back memories of her old country. If Saeng wouldn�t have found the hibiscus, she would have never started to reminisce about her old home. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her past, but it also helped her compare her new home to her old home. Through this she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so bad, and that she still has a little bit of her old home with her everyday. This realization gave her just enough hope and confidence to want to try the driving test again This ending shows the change of heart Saeng feels for @LOCATION1 and her small gain of hope and confidence.  	3	2		3																					
2654	4	I believe that the author ends the story the way she did because it talk�s about both of the subjects. The author is trying to say that when she takes her driving test next spring the hibiscus will give her confidence to pass her driving test. The author	1	1		1																					
2655	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says �In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again�. She is saying that she wants to start over. and adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again. because she says �when the snow melts and the geese return.� She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way.	2	1		2																					
2657	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she needs to adapt to the new country. She wants to wait when the hibiscus is budding. The plant budding shows than it is adapting to a new environment just like Saeng. The story shows that Saeng is not used to the new country. she cries when she sees the plants because it reminds her of her old home. The plant also comforts her. when she addapts to the new country, then she will take the test again.	1	2		2																					
2659	4	The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a vowe to herself because it shows how important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her determination because it reminds her of home. Saeng says �� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The hibiscus flower gives her confidence. It reminds her of her home in Vietnam before they moved to @LOCATION2. Therefore, the author concludes the story with that certain paragraph because it symbolizes the importance of the flower.	2	1		2																					
2661	4	In the story �winter @CAPS1� the author concludes the story with the last paragraph like that because when the season comes back around for budding she is going to be right back out there exsploring. She�s going to want to learn more about the hibiscus and what they do. And she can�t wait to start taking care of them as they start to bud. Thats why they ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2663	4	The author is saying that she will be ready soon enuff when the flowers begin to grow and the geese begin to come home, she will be ready	1	1		1																					
2664	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed the driver's test. She is saying when it get's a little warmer outside and the plants grow in maybe she will then take the test again and hopefully pass. I know that she failed the test because it said"" As Saeng walks home after Failing  her driver's test"". I guess that from the snow  being on the ground cause her to  make mistakes when taking the test. In conclusion, that�s why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.."	1	1		1																					
2665	4	In �@CAPS1 Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to make a point. She needs all of those thing to happen for her to be sound enough to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2666	4	The author ended the story this way because the plant represents new beginnings in which Saeng needs. Seang failed her test & needed some comfort. She went to the greenhouse & spent @MONEY1 on a hibiscus plant that reminded her of her home. It the same time the hibiscus plant reminded her that her new home is another new beginning. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng better hopes that starting over can be a good thing & that the next time she takes the test, she'll pass.	2	1		2																					
2667	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 reason why he does is because he wants to conclude by writing about geese. Second he like plants and the season�s that they bud. He vowed that he would take that test in the spring. He cant wait until the snow melts so that way he can take the test.	1	1		1																					
2672	4	"The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with this sentence when they come back saeng vowed silently to her self in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The Winter Hibiscus symbolizes her fondness of the place she used to live before. Its not a real one I�m mean not the kind we had at-at� she was still too shaky to say the words at home� when the hibiscus buds� she will still be fond of her home but she will have adapted better to her current enviroment. The geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day. When she finds that place she will find herself ready to �take the test"" or do things normally. The author concluded the story with the that sentence to show that Saeng will eventually grow into her new life."	3	2		3																					
2673	4	The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Like the geese are coming back she is positive that she can take the test again. She knows that she will pass the test. In the story she said �Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet reptition of season upon season, almost familiar to hernow� This means that when she had just moved here she thought that everything was strange because, she have not seen anything like this before. Now as she is living here to would get use to it because, she knows what will happen nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now	1	2		2																					
2675	4	The author concludes the story with that story because she loves her homeland and love�s nather and loves her mother. She loves the greeness and cant wait in tell spring comes. so she will take the test of being out of place to herself, that is why she concluds the story that way. 	1	1		1																					
2676	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well, but leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action.	1	1		1																					
2682	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�by Minfong Ho,the author  decided  to  end  it  with  the  sentence   �when they come back, Saeng  vowed  silently  to herself,  in   the  spring. When  the snows  melt and the geese  return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because  it show that even though the main character Saeng, @MONTH1 a failed once, she will trying again too. The  geese  will  be coming back to try out a  new  spring  and  the  hibiscus  will be budding new flowers so its like its starting over again as well and Saeng  says  that  if  both  have  made it once they tried again then   she can as well but this time she will succeed. Also, it shows the  determination  all  living  things  have  to  succeed at their main purpose. .The  flower  drivers  to re-bud. The  geese  drive  at  coming back  again  during  the  spring and the main character  drives  at  passing  the  test.The author of �Winter Hibiscus,�Minfong Ho,put that quote as the last  line of  the  story  for  inspiration.To  inspire  people  to  continue  the  path of life and if  you fail are task,try again.So the author gives you inspiration to help you continue to live your life	3	3		3																					
2684	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she�ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she�ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn�t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  	1	1		1																					
2686	4	The author includes this  because he�s using metaphors to explain how the author felt about Saeng�s personal life is	0	0		0																					
2687	4	The author concludes the story with paragraph because it shows Saeng�s sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she dissappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her mom�s gardening, she says, �Here, let me help, mother,� because her mom�s frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, �Saeng didn�t dare look her mother in the eye,� which shows Saeng�s concern for her mother�s reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, �It�s a beautiful plant, I�m glad you got it,� which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saeng�s sympathy to better   herself is shown in the story�s conclusion.	1	1		1																					
2688	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� is about a young girl who cares for gardening over schoolwork. The given conclusion is explaining, when spring comes, and the winter hibiscus is gone, she will pass the school test she failed before. Saeng only cares for the winter Hibiscus right now, for example, the line �I paid over nineteen dollars for it.� Explains she used all her money on this plant rather than any other food. Also the quote �I failed the test� with Saeng crying shows she failed it only because she was worrying about the hibiscus. In conclusion over the spring, when the winter hibiscus is gone, Saeng will focus on school more rather than gardening. Maybe now she will pass her test and go back to her hobby of gardening.	1	1		1																					
2690	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with a sentence about retaking the drivers test in the spring, to express the themes of adopting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower �Madagascar penwinhle� she thinks �how strange to see it in a pot� because �Back home it just grows wild,� The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says �and the geese return,� because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says �I will take that test again.� This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver�s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that �the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she �Dug out a hole� and knows it�s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng�s character.  	3	3		3																					
2693	4	The author ends the story with �when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2695	4	I think Saeng need to take the test over because to get her grade up. Saeng be waring about the snow, in the spirng because she is think about the flower getting cover over it. Saeng mother late her help with the pepper and melons, and lat her state dinner.	0	0		0																					
2696	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she�s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she�s not giving up ��then I will take that teat again� which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2697	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because during winter everything dies down till springs where everything is lively again, the Saeng would feel more motivated to do well on the test. Saeng is sort of like the plant, strives and worries in the winter and then blooms beautifully in the spring.  Also, I think the memories that the winter hibiscus plant brought her; motivated  her to stop staying in the past and move on towards the future.	2	1		2																					
2698	4	He  wrote this  because  he is talking  about weather changes	0	0		0																					
2701	4	She says this because right now it is winter and flowers can grow in the winter due to how cold it is. So she is saying when spring is back she will take the test of growing the flowers again. In conclusion, this is why the author states that conclusion at the end of the paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2702	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph to give you a sense of hope and determination for the future that dwells within saeng at that time .Throught  the story is seemed as though saeng was giving into despair at the remembrance of her home land ,she wasnt doing so well in her new country and and she had realized it the  most when she had �failed her driving test �.but when she  walked past the flower shop and saw all the plants that used to bloom so freely and beautifly  in her home  land comfind  in those ting pots and fighting to survive it reminded her of  herself here in @LOCATION1. As she began to plant her hibiscus she again compared herself to it and that is why when her plant blooms on the spring so well she will pass that test   	2	3		3																					
2704	4	The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng�s attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she�s not going to give up. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. In conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons.	2	2		2																					
2705	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph I think because since the girl failed her test the bud reminds her of her grandmothers long grey hair and I guess that gives her good luck so when the winter passes by and the spring time hits thats buds start to come back out and thats when she will take her test again. Thats why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story.	1	2		2																					
2706	4	I am going to tell you why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason the author does is because it tells you that Saeng is confident. It also tells you she wont give up. And it shows that she is willing to take her ability to the next level. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
2708	4	The author decided to conclude the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s determination to adapt to her new life. In the third paragraph on the second page the author writes, �Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile� That atleast, she could hold onto.� After failing her driver�s test Saeng was feeling foreign and alone. She desperately looked to the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned. After a discussion with her mother Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings. By concluding the story, with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must �blossom� in her new home in order to do well. She still needs time for this, as the flowers needs time to plant its roots into the ground.	3	3		3																					
2709	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Maybe to show confidence that she would do everything over again if she had to. For example ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", so basically she's saying she's willing to take that step, that chance . The author ended the story with this confidence and couragement.."	1	1		1																					
2710	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.� She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself so she made a vowe to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her.	1	1		1																					
2715	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to end it on a good note and send a good message there not going to quit because they failed the first time.	1	1		1																					
2717	4	The author concludes the story wt this passage because its symbolic. When the Geese come back in the spring it will be like a now beginning. When the Hibiscus is budding it has a new life. When all this happens Saeng will have a new fresh start too. Leaving the story to end like this is a cliff-hanger for some. It makes you wanting more, knowing she failed her test you want to know if Saeng will pass it in the spring, @CAPS1 a fresh new start. Everything and everyone will have new starts when the beginning of the new season comes around when the hibiscus blooms it will be like she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, new connections w/her past and comfort during hard times. The Hibiscus symbolizes all this	3	2		3																					
2720	4	"The young girl Saeng from the story ""Winter Hibiscus� by minfong Ho, has moved from her home land of Vietnam to the United States. The young girl was hoping to get her drivers license but failed, The hibiscus she sees comforts her reminding her of Vietnam. When she purchases it her mother is concern of the price but sees how home sick her daughter is and becomes understanding. After planting the Hibiscus She watches the geese and understands that every year they change their habitat. The geese inspire Saeng along with the Hibiscus and promises herself that"" in the spring when the snow melts away the geese return and thes Hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."	2	2		2																					
2721	4	The author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an end. Wit  this saeng tell @LOCATION1 that all the snow is gone she will take the test again. If one read   now between the lives it   says more than just this. She really likes the hibiscus and when the hibiscus goes back to life in the spring, she will have new energy to take the test again. From her experience with the hibiscus we can see that this plant really influent her. Because this  plant reminds  her so much of her old home.  Also we can see that everything and everybody should get a second chance. In her case it is the test she wants to take again. Also in the spring she lives a couple month in the @LOCATION1 and she will adjust herself to this new situation. At the moment she is just homesick, even if her home is the @LOCATION1 now. So the hibiscus is good for her, it is some think she can hold onto from her old home� 	2	2		2																					
2724	4	The last paragraph means only one thing. That one thing is to be like a Hibiscus @CAPS1 to take the test again of life. See will come back in the spring just like the Hibiscus will. So as you can see the last paragraph had a very good meaning to it.	1	1		1																					
2727	4	She concluded the paragraph with that paragraph to show that she is serious about her gardening and that she won�t garden until geese come back.	1	1		1																					
2729	4	The author concludes this story because it shows her determination. It says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home. It also says that as the buds grow so will she. But her more mentally then physically. And her taking the test again is meaning that she has faith in herself that she will mature and grow up to be a person who misses their home land but accepts the new home that they live in. That is why the author ended this way.	2	2		2																					
2731	4	Reserved need to check keenly	3	3		3																					
2734	4	"The author of the story, chooses to end the story with that sentence because the story is mainly about how Saeng failed her drivers test, but when she saw the hibiscus, it reminded her of home and made her feel better. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng says, �And that rich, sweet scent � that was familiar too,"" talks about how nice the flowers were and how familiar they were because she reconized the scent. Saeng was already upset about leaving her home in @LOCATION1, then coming to @LOCATION2 and then failing her drivers test, just made it worse, but then she saw the flower and it reminded her of her home, so she felt a little better. So when the author uses that quote, they end the story that way to show that she will have enough courage to try again when the flower blooms."	2	3		3																					
2739	4	The author uses this paragraph to conclude to show she�s going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings. For example the story says �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon, almost fimiliar to her now�. Saying that she is getting used to where she is now and wants and is willing to give it a chance. Almost as if she doesn�t find it that bad as she thought at first it being different and not her home and where she was used to being.  	2	2		2																					
2745	4	The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the �metaphor� compares Saeng and her test to the perenial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathalon, and my goal was to place first, I place @NUM1 overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathalon came again, and I placed @NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.    	1	2		2																					
2746	4	The Author includes that part in his story because it�s talking about na ture and a the beuttifl thing's in natural. Ther�s the @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, tall green grass the white @CAPS3 fence and in the story there are those sanne type's of things that been in nature.	0	0		0																					
2751	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because 1. Saeng failed the test. @NUM1. It takes time for a hibiscus to bud. @NUM2. It sound like a good end i not and plus she would not want to take the test in the snow.	1	1		1																					
2756	4	The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simpley set a time for her to try again. Saeng wants to make it in this world and wants to have a good life, so she tries new things	1	1		1																					
2758	4	I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because it�s  meaning fail odvestily Saeng  really like garden and it�s  something  special to her . Also when all the snow  melts  she  will  take  the test  and  hopfully get her drivers  licesies.	1	1		1																					
2761	4	"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she�s showing she is trying she wants another chance. She realized her mistake�s and ready to start over, Even though she faild by trying to grow her hibiscus in the winter she is trying to start over when the @DATE1 comes in. for example in the story. It stated the ""winter hibiscus"" was in the ground now, and saeng tamped down the soil around it over head, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yes familiar to saeng snow. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
2762	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks it�ll bring her good luck in the test. When she goes back to take the test she�ll have the comfort of her home land of the hibiscus plant to encourage her to pass the driving test. When she takes the test again she�ll ve mast to pass due to the comfort of home and she�ll be used to the area being different from her homeland. In order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little but more confident in herself. Having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can help her a lot in being confident in herself.	2	1		2																					
2764	4	I think that this snows hope because she had really missed her homeland and kind of found peace and serenity by being around them she says �That at least she could hold on to� meaning the bud I think that she was very upset because of missing home she missed having her grandmother wash her hair and put a dok mallk into it. I think that since she really had nothing else but the flowers that reminded of her homeland the text said �where was the fine toothed come the hibiscus hedge, the well. her gentle grandmother she was missing all these thing so I think that by putting her in this posistion it has brought her to a place of where she not only misses the people from her homeland but the beautiful things as well and how she always has kind of a part of home with her because of the flower.	2	2		2																					
2766	4	The author concludes the story like this because it show that she is determined to do pass the test. It is also like if the birds can fly south she can pass that test.	1	1		1																					
2768	4	"I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" proves that shes moving on with life and so will all the creature in the world. Also even knew she moved to a new country doesn�t mean she cant still enjoy the things from her homeland, �but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.� thats why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on.  "	2	2		2																					
2769	4	The author concludes the story w/this paragraph because she really isnt worried about when they take the test again, she�s only concerned w/the plants she picked out. Also, she knows that it will be a really long time before she takes the test again so that gives her more time to study and get more prepared and focused. The author also ends this article w/this paragraph because she wants to let the readers know that since she failed the @NUM1 time she will be back again to take it over and nothing will stop the author from failing.	1	1		1																					
2770	4	It shows not to give up, it ends almost  the same way it began, it shows that people should not stay too attached to the past each are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then she will try again later to pass it. Also the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to which is a good way of writing. One last thing is that it shows that people shouldn�t become too attached to the past because if they look at one thing that reminds them of it they @MONTH1 fall apart, that is why she takes the test, to see if she can look at the familiar flowers without falling apart.   	2	2		2																					
2773	4	"The auther conclude the story by saying she will take the test again in the spring and uptill then vow silently because the spring reminded Saeng of home. In Vietnam there were many beautiful wild flowers. Sarng goes to the flower shop to get a peice of home. It said the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind.� This shows that the plant was not the same because there were also no buds. She had just failed her driving test before this and needed hope, so al waiting till spring when the hibiscus will bloom again that will give Saeng a sense of home which will give her hope to do good on the driving test. "	2	2		2																					
2774	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng whole world is the plants a since they are gone there is no motivation.	0	0		0																					
2776	4	The author @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because of the titel and the begening of the story. Or he @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because he wants to. He @MONTH1 have concluded the story like that to show what @MONTH1 happen. But is good conclusion is a good conclusion. 	0	0		0																					
2777	4	I really do not know why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Possibly because she started to talk.	0	0		0																					
2779	4	The author concludes the story saying that because she wants to show us that Saeng is confident in herself and will not hesitate to take the test again. She went over to the corner of the vegteble patch and started to dig a hole in the ground.	1	1		1																					
2782	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is talking about how there will be a new start. Since Saeng failed the test and in the winter the plant will die in the spring the plant will bud again and she will retake the test. Its a new chance to start things over.	1	1		1																					
2784	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.	1	1		1																					
2786	4	"In the story called ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes the story with this paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, than I will take that test again."" The reason why the author had put that at the end of the story was because when things go under ground everyone wants to wait and wait until it comes back up again because when you fail everything goes down but if you wait awhile than everything will start to raise Just like flowers and everything else that you can think of. So that is why the author put that at the end of the story cause to tell people that it is ok for people to fail Just as long as you get up and try again until you reach your goal. So that is what the author was talking about and thats why Minfong Ho put that at the end of the story so that people can read and learn for what it says."	1	2		2																					
2788	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her and when it is budding she feels stronger. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say �at home.� When she says �and this hibiscus is budding,� I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a �V� so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again.	3	3		3																					
2792	4	I believe the author ended the story with the �test� because it is a big part of Saeng�s life or part of her tradition.	1	1		1																					
2796	4	The author concluded the story with saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. When walking home from her test, Saeng saw a familiar flower and chose to make a delar to a flower shop. There, she saw many flowers that reminded her of home. she bought a hibiscus and went home. Her and her mother planted it, after saeng realized the flower could make it through the winter. She looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she realized that she has adapted to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus gave courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue surviving in @LOCATION1.	2	2		2																					
2800	4	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn�t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn�t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task	1	2		2																					
2803	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the hibiscus flower will be adaptating to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has began to grow older and much wiser of things allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now of where she is living just how the hibiscus flower adapts to it's place with ease and gets use to seasons.	2	3		3																					
2804	4	The author @CAPS1 the story with this paragraph because Saeng is saying that When She @CAPS2 @CAPS2 back she will take the test over again wich means that in form of test is that wile she was there it was a test of servle and when the story begains it is a the begaing of the test and at the end of the story the test and there leveing and she wants to come back to see what grew. The author is also saying that you don�t know how good you have it.  	0	0		0																					
2810	4	I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.  	1	2		2																					
2813	4	The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver�s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on.	2	2		2																					
2814	4	"I believe the author concluded the story with �When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� because it shows the entire theme of the story. The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrats this when she says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example �The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair."" The hibiscus was something from home that gave her good memorys. The hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better. "	2	2		2																					
2816	4	The author concludes the story with this saying because it will be a fresh start and it will be spring and beautiful. �@CAPS1 plant  it right now� is telling me that she wants another try. She wants a fresh strart and come spring when all of her pretty flowers are bloming and geting there chance she wants her now chance to pass best.	0	0		0																					
2818	4	After reading �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. I believe Ho ended the story with that paragraph to support her idea of overcoming  obstacles. First after failing her driving test, Saeng was very upset and didn�t know if she would ever pass it. But after seeing a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her home in Vietnam which inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive. But, after seeing how the plant brought joy to Saeng, her mother forgave her. Last when saeng was digging a hole to let the hibiscus grow, it inspired Saeng to take the test again because she overcame the obstacles of brining the plant home and letting it grow. Therefore, I believe Ho end �Winter Hibiscus�, to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles.	2	2		2																					
2819	4	"The last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus reminded her that her ""home"" was her old life, but misses @CAPS1 in her new life. She gains determination through the reminder of this. She soon realizes that she is home, for things have come familiar to her, such as the V formation of the geese. She loved her old home, but she realized it was time to move on. The last paragraph does not only mean retaking a driving test, it symbolizes the determination to embrace her new home and life.  "	2	3		3																					
2821	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.	1	1		1																					
2823	4	"He ended the paragraph like that because he @MONTH1 want you to read on, or it could be that he is showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when. the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ""The quote is showing the flower can fight through the winter and come back. Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to retake the test. Which shows that they both have modivation and the integrity to come back."	1	2		2																					
2825	4	The last line is included in the story �Winter Hibiscus� because it showed the connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time she decides to take it again in the spring. The hibiscus flower like Saeng is out of place and will have to make it through the winter into the spring so it can bud again. This shows how like the flower Saeng will bud again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions in @LOCATION1. So they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to. This shows again how the last line connects the girl and the flower together. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to wrap up the story with a connection between the flower and Saeng.	2	3		3																					
2830	4	"The author chooses to end the story in a very deep, connected way. Itis ended On a note of rebirth and second chances. when Saeng vows,� when the come back, inthe spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, when the Hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again,"" The author is connecting a sense oF a new country and second chances and rebirth. Spring and snow melting could be connected to rebirth, while the geese returning could symbolize a second chance. this is connected to saengs second chance.The author also shows that saeng is getting used to the new country, which shows a sense of hope. Itshows that thereis some hope for her test. "	2	2		2																					
2834	4	The reason I think that the author did it is because wanted you to know what time it took place and what the weather was like then it also so tells you how long she is going to wait like till the snow melts and that is going to be while and when the geese live and return home so this is why I think she tells you what is like.	0	0		0																					
2837	4	The author concludes story with that paragraph because she wants there to be hope for the future seeing that hibiscus budding in the spring is what Saeng is waiting for. It gives her hope that she will be able to pass that test again. This is showed when she says �.. and this  hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ��@CAPS1 the winter ,Saeng hopes she will improve and when the hibiscus  buds she will know that it is time to try again .Saeng sees the spring as a new beginning. So that means it is a time to overcme her obstade.I think that obstade or test might be to not cry when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she is growing just like the hibiscus     	2	3		3																					
2838	4	The author concludes the story with that paragrap for one main reason.	0	0		0																					
2840	4	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms. Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.	2	2		2																					
2841	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because she wants to do it right next time. Whats its saying is that she can try every year to get it right to impress her mother. In conclusion that what I have to say about the paragraph	1	1		1																					
2843	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. For example, it shows a sense of hope, when she says �this hibiscus is budding"". That indicates a new beginning or starting over. I think that is the idea the author is trying to get across. Obviously it was difficult for the author to adjust to her new country. For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus wasn�t the same as the one in her homeland. Even though she's feeling hostalgic; this paragraph reassures the reader that the author is willing to give her new country another chance."	2	2		2																					
2844	4	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that �when they come back ... I will take the test again,� (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, �A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept �(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. 	2	2		2																					
2845	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show she loved them flowers. That they met a whole lot to her. When she failed her driven test she was sad. An the flower made her feel better. now that the snow is failing she waits untill spring that when they come up and she will have faith and take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2846	4	The author concluded this sentence because he was letting everyone know that Saeng would return to the hibiscus and take care of it still, and that she has not forgotten about it.	0	0		0																					
2847	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, a teenager, Saeng, moves from Vietnam to the United states. She later takes a drivers test, but doesn't not succeed in passing, but does succeed in finding comfort from her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph states ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many raesons. These being that Saeng was very upset about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland and the changes she's had to adapt to during this move. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng a hope to continue her jouney even when things get very hard. The winter is this plants time of trouble and sadness, as Saeng's time of trouble and sadness is failing this test and not being at her real home. The end of winter gives both the plant and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope to start over, Saeng will find it easy to get through hardships if she continues to find comfort from her past."	3	3		3																					
2848	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to get the readers wondering. To show that she�s not going to give up on what she wants to do.	1	1		1																					
2850	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng  relatestnct  she needs more time. If she takes a break and does what she needs to then she @MONTH1 be able to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2853	4	The author ends the story with the sentence provided because , she as she was saying that when  you and winter are over there be the time again to get there gardening back to the test with the plant she had planted. 	0	0		0																					
2854	4	The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion.	1	1		1																					
2855	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because when the hibiscus started budding it will give her inspiration to try and past the test again. In order to past the test she wanted to feel like she was home, And to have memories of her home to incourage her to try again. Therefore, this is the reason the author concludes the story with the last paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2856	4	The author concludes the story with a paragraph taking the test again to show that the narrator @MONTH1 be upset about being in a new place but she will keep trying. The narrator gets upset when she knows the hibiscus is not like the one's from her old home. This upsets her because she probably misses things that she was used to before. The author uses that paragraph to show the narrator is strong and won�t give up on making things the way they were but also showing that she'll try to adapt to her new home. The author does this to show that you should keep trying at something that you love. The narrator will keep trying when the geese fly back and the hibiscus is budding. So the author is saying try if you fail and set goals to never give up.	2	2		2																					
2857	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.	0	0		0																					
2860	4	In the �passage winter Hibiscus� by monfong Ho, the quote � when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again, it symbolizes @CAPS1 new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland @CAPS2 she states �I � failed the test.� This test meant more to then she just failing. She was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The � when they came back�� quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again.	2	3		3																					
2861	4	She will go back to where she started. Its a circle and she will be back the next year where she began.	0	0		0																					
2863	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� ecause that flower budding would make her feel confident about everything. The reason I think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland. It�s basically like she has a little peice of home in her new home. An example that represents this is, �Not like the kind we had before,� this is explaining the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this reminds her of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story the way they do,	2	1		2																					
2864	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home land she will eventualy pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misss the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.	2	2		2																					
2867	4	The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to adjust to her new home and that she will not give up. You can tell that she still misses her homeland by her reaction to seeing the hibiscus plant, but also that she is growing accustomed to her new home because of how she recognizes the geese and will make the decision if when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns.	2	1		2																					
2873	4	The author ends the story by saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story. When she gets home her mother �noticed the tear staie on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes.� Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story but by the end she felt happy and optimistic. 	2	1		2																					
2875	4	The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.	0	0		0																					
2877	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. Durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it it�s winter and the hibiscus hasen�t bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And thats why I think the author ended with that paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2881	4	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph becauses it symbolizes Saeng�s decision to try again. Things in nature are repeatative, seasons change but eventually they appear again, geese migrate but they too return and the author used this as a comparsion to Saeng�s decision to try for her license again. Just like Saeng the winter hibiscus was out of. As normal environment but was learning to adapt and that inspired Saeng to keep an trying even if she failed because the hibiscus was trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place.	2	2		2																					
2887	4	The author concludes the story with this  paragraph  because,Saeng  is determined  to  pass the test. She knows when its spring and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test I think she wants to retake the test because  the  hibiscus makes her think about her homeland. It makes her feel more confident. She thinks she can pass it next time. The hibiscus  makes  her  happy and overwhelmed. She wants to retake the test. She�s sure she will do better next time.	1	2		2																					
2888	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. It�s just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. That�s the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.  	2	2		2																					
2891	4	He concludes the story because he was another chance to etact the test.	0	0		0																					
2892	4	"The author concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to emphasize a new life and new chances for the main character. The future setting of the paragraph, spring, symbolizes rebirth & another start from the cold, hard winter. The author takes this to heart including, more events which enhance this symbolized meaning. the author has uses structured choice to carry her toughts. Recreate, when to convey the theme of rebirth, the author uses words like ""the gesse return"" and ""take the test again"" which add to the importance at the home. Also, the literal action of the ""hibiscus is budding"" @CAPS1 rebirth. In winter the plant is dormant & less colorful, but in the spring the plant shows rebirth through about color in its buds. The author finally conveys the theme of rebirth by ending with this paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2894	4	She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph she says a whole thing it means she will look at it when the winter is done. She will be able to retake the test again in the spring. That is what she was writing about	1	1		1																					
2895	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new sorrounds. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place. In the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her. The spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming, the geese return, and the snow has melted. Saeng feels like she could adapt to her new surroundings with the comfort of her memories of her old life.	2	1		2																					
2899	4	She is talking about the flowers and win she says test I think she means how she looks  and exameans the flowers and see the snow fall all over again. It sounds like the author is some one how admayers flowers a lot or maybe just this one hibiscus and how it buddies. Maybe she is just some one how likes to see changes.	1	1		1																					
2901	4	"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"". The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese & the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one."	2	3		3																					
2903	4	I think the author concludes this paragraph in this story to describe how grown up Saeng is now since it doesn�t look like she leaves with her mom anymore. To the author probably wants to emphasize the reader @CAPS1 of Saeng, now on for she probably leave since she doesn't leave with her mom anymore. In what happen was just her past and will be memorable to Saeng.	0	0		0																					
2907	4	The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life. The test might be one to see if she can understand her self. There changes in the weather all the time there changes in the spring fall she other that you just got to get over.	1	1		1																					
2908	4	In the story the �winter Hibiscus� by minfong Ho the writers ends with a paragraph that concludes the story. One of the reasons she concluded with the last paragraph the @CAPS1 she did is because it tells the reader that Saeng  @CAPS1 not given up on her drivers test. �� Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� This explains in more details when  she will take the test Again another years on is because it leaves the reader to think how the rest of the story will go.	1	2		2																					
2910	4	The writes this this conclusion to the end of the story because he wants people to know that the season's are changing and the flowers are going to be dying. He also wants you you to know that when the season changes back the flower will try and fit again with the other flowers. that�s what the author means when he talks about taking the test again.	0	0		0																					
2911	4	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says �when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.� The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on.	2	2		2																					
2921	4	The author conclude the story with this paragraph to show that saeng is going to retake the test over when all these things happen. Saeng shows that she is not going to give up, and that she is going to keep trying. The hibiscus is a lucky charm to her to keep during the test to strive her to pass the test. In addition, the author also conclude the story with this paragraph to show saeng personal thoughts, and how she feels about this test. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, is a indication that it time to give the test another try. In conclusion, the paragraph is a indication that saeng is never going to forget.	2	1		2																					
2922	4	The author concludes the story with  the last paragraph of the story. When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibisous is budding, their i will take that test again.	0	0		0																					
2923	4	I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up	0	0		0																					
2925	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows he determination. In the spring it will be hard for the hibiscus to survive because its a winter hibiscus and it also has determination.	1	1		1																					
2926	4	I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, �it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here� @CAPS1 it�s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again.	2	2		2																					
2927	4	The author includes this last paragraph in the story, �Winter Hibiscus� to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to @LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.� Saeng�s mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in @LOCATION2 that she is not used to. �When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.    	3	3		3																					
2928	4	"The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with ""wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable.

2929	4	The past experiences of our lives often  influence things in our life, weather we consciously know it or not. In this story Saeng  tries to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the cestain  flower that reminels her of her home, when she fails. She is trying to get over the fact that she is not �at home,� that things and people that use to be ground no longer are. But there are new things that she is becoming used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can alway�s  change. She is trying to put things that make her used further  back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year, because it is always possible to do something if you really wants to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng  really wants to pass her own mind test, so she can further adapt to change, her mother will be proud of her.	3	2		3																					
2931	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted the readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test over again.	1	1		1																					
2934	4	The speaker @MONTH1 conclude the story with that paragraph because the geese returning and the hibiscus budding @MONTH1 help her with her confidence. She wants to feel like she can do this test.	1	1		1																					
2944	4	In the short story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the author includes a paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. Ho, includes this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States, her and her mother had moved here from Vietnam. Throughout the story she is reminising about her home life in Vietnam. About her grandmother, and the flowers there. �Where was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?� When at the flower shop, Saeng finds an hibiscus, flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, wants to become adapted to the @LOCATION3 and beable to live here without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show Saeng too, wants to adapt to her surrounding and pass the driving test,	0	0		0																					
2945	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the true meaning of the hibiscus. The hibiscus is symbolic to Saeng in several ways, but the most important is that it represents change and growth and the ability to overcome obstacles. Upon seeing it, she is overcome with childhood memories and sentimentality. However, she must adjust to her new home if she wants to grow as a person. She will survive here, just as the hibiscus will survive through the winter. Also, Saeng vows that �in the spring� when �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is determined to succeed, and the hibiscus itself represents triumph over obstacles.  It stands for survival and endurance through life�s disappointments and challenges, from failing a driver�s test to starting a new life in a strange and foreign country. The author�s choice to end the story with this paragraph exhibits Saeng�s ultimate understanding of her strength through the symbol of the hibiscus.	3	3		3																					
2946	4	I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn�t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year. Ane example of this is an exact quote �in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again�. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that.	1	1		1																					
2947	4	The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her drivers test for the first time when the hibiscus starts to bud it will represent a change in her life. Also, Saeng use to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam so when the flower buds it could show that she has a new home. 	1	1		1																					
2948	4	The author finished the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason for conclusion is that it is important for Saeng  to feel at home. When the hibiscus buds it wiil remind her of home and this will comfort her, when she feels at peace and at home she will do better on the test.	1	1		1																					
2950	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph. She does because she is ready to do the same thing next year. She like spending time with her mom, she likes plants, she likes having fun with her mom. This are some reasons why she concludes with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2953	4	�If at first you don�t succeed, try, try again.� This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng�s situation in the short story, �Winter Hibiscus.� Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.� This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter.	3	3		3																					
2955	4	She compares the paragraph to the story to compare it to school. The test is makeing new friends and doing good on the test and classes. In the paragraph it said �Then I will take that test again.� That is the reason she is comparing that paragraph to school.  	0	0		0																					
2956	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the Saeng's determination to over come the obstacles of her past experience. For example, the story starts out with Saeng taking a �test�,  while reliving her memories in the greenhouse, she started to breakdown. �A wave of loss so deep and story it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" She then buys the plant and takes it home to her mother,telling her that she 'failed'. The mother then becomes understanding and helps Saeng's vow retake the 'test', the narrator emphasizes Saeng�s determination to overcome the troubles of her past and go on with the future."	2	2		2																					
2957	4	Because her school work was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a green garden. And it is obvious she failed the test so when spring starts to show she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom and she can do more study to pass the test and not have to take it again. I get the feeling though she is also looking forward to the spring time coming back now an day so she can enjoy the flowers and the presents of growing and studying.	1	1		1																					
2958	4	"I think that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because she wanted us to see that Saeng was not giving up Saeng was originally from Vietnam but she moved to the United States. She missed being home so much because nothing was the same. �It�s not a real one,� Saeng mumbled. �I mean, not like the kind we had at-at'. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. �But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, she decided that she was going to give the drive�s test one more try. �When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""	2	2		2																					
2962	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.In the story, glimpses of @CAPS1 home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. �She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.� Here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saeng�s despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, �then I will take that test again.�you can feel her hope. Also, the author want`s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says,�the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,� and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security.	3	3		3																					
2963	4	The author concludes the story of the paragraph because, the author would like to finish the last sentence of the story. Also at the last of the paragraph is when she is visualizing and putting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are appreciated to the plant. The author wanted more evidence to the story. For example, when it said, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese ruturn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It includes the winter time for the plant. Also, the @DATE2 and spring the plant comes back, which the character saeng will get it back, and visit it.	1	0		1																					
2967	4	I think the author wrote that because maybe that how she fells like in the winter she could really show people who she is but when spring come out she like a flower that has been dead all winter  	0	0		0																					
2969	4	In the story the Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho it explains the obstacles Saeng went through coming to a different country. In this story Saeng had just failed her driving test as she was reminded of her home through some tropical flowers. Moreover the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.� This part of the story is very important because it examines her growth and hope for change, just us the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a buetiful blossed flower. Furthermore it explains to the each that she will not give up and that she will change to the environment just as th plant lives has and the geese come back to the changed environment. That part of the story is very important for the reader, @CAPS1 it concludes Saeng thoughts and hopes for the future wile adapting to her new enviorment.     	3	3		3																					
2970	4	The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there waste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there watste.

2971	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng said she failed the test, and when spring comes back then she will take the test again. The last paragraph reads �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� She really does not tell us what test she is supposed to be taking.	1	1		1																					
2972	4	The reason why the said she will wait til spring to take the test again, is to see if she�s still like the bitter melon over the Big-mac.	0	0		0																					
2973	4	The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story.	1	1		1																					
2975	4	What the author concludes that in the spring time when the snows melts and the flower comes back it makes be risk of spring time at home. Which makes her relax. Also spring time is a more pretty time because all the flowers are out and the flower that reminds her at home blessings.	1	1		1																					
2977	4	The paragraph shows that Saeng has a lot of feelings for her plants. She enjoys plants and she loves taking the time to spend with the plants. She means in that last paragraph that she cant wait for winter to leave so her plants will be budding and that she can enjoy her plants.	0	0		0

2984	4	Why the author concluded with this paragraph was because it showed a restated the main idea of the story and the readers understood what the story was about. That is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2985	4	The author explains that she has failed the test. While it is still winter and the hibiscus is still trying to grow it's lovely peddles back. As she tells her mother �that she will not take the test again, until the hibiscus starts budding and spring is back.	1	1		1																					
2991	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up until she successfully passes the task he mother gives her.Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant it is much to expensive. �But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn�t cost that much!� Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has failed her mother. Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. �Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the �winter hibiscus� into it.� This shows that even though she had failed she wasn�t going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home. It was very special to her.	1	1		1																					
2993	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story the character � Saeng� is feeling homesick and has not adapted to her new country. She is on her way home from her driver�s test, which she just failed, and on the way she sports a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hishiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort in time of disappoint, connection to her past experiences and ability to overcome obsticales. Saeng has not adjusted to this change in her life and it has affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obsticates in your life but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome it. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and showing the reader that saeng was the hibiscus as her way of overcoming and when she is ready and she has ajusted she will take her driving test again.	3	2		3																					
2995	4	"This paragraph represents an action that Saeng is going to do over a time period of a year. She is going to build up and change in time for the retake of the test its like a rebirth in a way. The girl wants to be a whole new person for when the test comes up again. Her mom seems to be bothered by every action or choice of her daughters. The daughter suddenly relizes the action for the hibiscus and why it dies. ""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season."" She relates the flower and geese to herself. Over the year the flower goes through phases dying then rebirth. Saeng wants to get better once she goes through a phase like the flower. Its opens up to be beautiful again.  "	2	3		3																					
2997	4	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese."	3	2		3																					
2999	4	The author concluded his storie with that paragraph is because thats how it should end and that�s why he ended it like   that.     	0	0		0																					
3000	4	The author concludes the story with �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She does this to show now Saeng is adapting and making decisions in her new country just like she did in her homeland. In Vietnam Saeng used to brush her grandmothers hair and help put it into a bun and put a hibiscus in it. That was one of her traditions with it. Also when she used to get water from the well a hibiscus would sometimes come up with the bucket. Both these thus the hibiscus was seen as a comfort object, now as she is in the states, she is trying to put it to good use, while also taking into account what repeats in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and plants start to grow in the spring. By her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom. The plant being potted in her garden and Saeng moving her both signify change, but a rembrance of old traditions, and a space for new.     	3	3		3																					
3001	4	The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese.	1	1		1																					
3002	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph To show the final determination and strength Saeng has been given. It�s almost as though it�s taken this plant To show her to get back up and pass the Test. The plant becomes a comporting item that reminds her of her homeland. She returned with the plant To show her mother but found herself too shaky to even say the words �at home"". This shows how much she misses home. But she is able to realize that this is her new home and everything is becoming more familiar To her. "	2	2		2																					
3004	4	The author end with that paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she has failed this time, more opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times befall her now, good times are still to come. For several reasons, it was a powoful efficient way to end the story.	1	1		1																					
3005	4	The author uses symbolism to convey a different message. Saeng said in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, and then I will take that test again. The author uses the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng gets older like the hibiscus, that then she will be ready to take that test again. The author uses symbolize to convey more of the story.	2	2		2																					
3008	4	In the conclusion of the �Winter Hibiscus� Saeng notes how she will retake  her driving test in the spring when the snow melt sand the geese return.The spring is when these events occur along with the annual budding  of the  winter  hibiscus. Her family had moved from Vietnam to @LOCATION2, and she had bought a winter hibiscus  plant  to remind  her of  her  childhood. When it blooms, she  will retake her driving test because the body will bring her the hope of a new beginning in her life, and as a citizen in @LOCATION2.	2	2		2																					
3009	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� a young girl named Saeng moves away from home. This short story is the girl is trying to adapt to the new lifestyle and changes.	1	1		1																					
3010	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she want the reader to see that saeng will not stop until she passes her drivers test, just like the geese won�t stop until they are in the south for winter. the author is trying to show the beauty of trying again and going through your obstcles to your goal.	1	2		2																					
3011	4	"In the stoRy �WinteR Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authoR leaves the stoRy off with a poweRful ending. The ending was �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRself, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese RetuRn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will tRy the test again"". Basically the authoR concluded the stoRy with that because it shows she's poweRful, that she's willing to tRy and make heRself stRongeR, that she's willing to tRy again, and that she wants to help heRself. Text examples to pRoove this would be, �then I will take the hibiscus test again,"" ""Almost Reluctantly, she Realized that many of the things that she had thought of as stRange befoRe had become..."", and ""TheRe was a fRail, wiRy beauty to heR that touched Saeng deeply."" All those statements help backup why the authoR might leave such poweRful paRagRaph foR last."	1	2		2																					
3017	4	"The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding. This shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring. This gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive. Another hardship that she and the hibiscus both @CAPS1 is being ""root bound."" The author misses her home oF Vietnam very much. However, both oF them must and will adOpt to their new environments.."	3	2		3																					
3019	4	The author Minfong Ho concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus�, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, �.. in the spring...� it�s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It�s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  	3	3		3																					
3023	4	Clearly From rending the story Winter @CAPS1, the author @CAPS2 this phrase �when they come Back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test Again� in the story because the passage relates to the title of the story Winter @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
3026	4	At the end of the story the author says �when they come back in the spring, whe the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again.� The author concludes this at the end because she felt like she didn�t do her best because she failed so when the spring comes again She is going to retry to do it and hopefully this time she will past.  	1	1		1																					
3027	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because she wants to come back an an do smell test again when the snow melts and the geese return.	0	0		0																					
3029	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test. The hibiscus will have started sprouting and the will give her the strength to take the test again and hopeful pass it all because of the winter hibiscus reminded her of home.	2	1		2																					
3033	4	I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It basically sumarizises the story and sums it up into few words that would want you to wonder what happened next, and if there is a sequel. This is a very good story that I personally can relate to in many ways.	1	1		1																					
3035	4	The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girls cofidence in herself. It also gives her enough time to get ready for the next test. Also she knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud.	1	1		1																					
3037	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was saying that if it is possible for these things to happen then she should be able to take the test and pass it. She was comparing things together that she knew that do noot go together. For example she said that in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then she would take the test over. She meant that if the thing she likes the most overcomes its obstacle then she would do what hurted her the most over again. She doesn�t know if she takes the test over she would keep trying over and over until she passes it. In the story she doesn�t know to fit in. All she knows is what she learned in her country . All she have to do is try harder and she maybe will be able to pass his test .	2	2		2																					
3038	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paraghragh because when she told her mom she failed her test she was crying, But I think it was deeper than that. I think she missed home so much that she couldn't concentrate. She had to cry about something because she didn't want to let her mom know that she misses home.	1	1		1																					
3041	4	What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that where it is a seasson for those plants she will take the test again. The test to begin to like like the plot. Like features and characters about. Also the history about these plants. 	0	0		0																					
3042	4	She is demanding to not take the test again if the winter hibiscus don't come back she was upset that she had failed the test. She spent most of her day looking at the hibiscus but she was still upset that they were�nt the real ones back at home. Her mother said they are strong enough to make it through the winter. when they come back  Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again	1	1		1																					
3043	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because is symbolizes the hope that things will get better. The author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year. So can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will. This is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note. The girl spends the entire day wishing that she were back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends. But this paragraph is the girl vowing a promise to her self that she will withstand the winter until spring and it will get better when she can take the test again. The entire story builds up to this turning point when Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter. Saeng realizes that it is going to take time for her to adapt to this new and strange country and the new lifestyle that she must adopt	3	3		3																					
3046	4	"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home, and the old, together in harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which relates to the determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently through the winter. A lot of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages hidden within that final sentence It implies that, though the past @MONTH1 be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can be conquered."	1	2		2																					
3048	4	"In the story �winter Hibiscus� the author Minfong Ho ends with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" she ended with this show her determination to do good in her country and show that memories of her grandmother help her to strive for the best in her new country, in her new home. In the beginning of the story Saeng is at a flower shop and she sees all the flowers of her home country growing in poto. At the sight of all these flowers memories flood back to her, memories that bring her joy and sadness. Then when she returns home she tells her mother that she failed the test you can tell from her actions that she is disappointed, �I-I failed the test  Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye  nervously tore off a leab,shredding it to bits�. After a while she planted the flower in the vegetable garden. The buying and planting of the vegetable shows that Saeng wants to remember her grandmother and home. Thinking  about her grandmother helps her to survive for better, helps her want to succeed in her new home. Memories of her grandmother make her sad but in away make her happy.  "	3	2		3																					
3051	4	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng was a very determined person. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng was a strong character because throughout the story she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time. But when she failed, the author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up hope and that she was going to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3052	4	The author concludes the story with this Paragraph because so you can get a view of what she is saying and also so you can understand it from her situration she was growing up like for example she said that	0	0		0																					
3053	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because he is making a point about immigration. The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to @CAPS1 they were told to forget where they were from . The word test in the story means getting used to @LOCATION1 and forgetting her homeland. Saeng  says thoes words because she failed the test and bought something that reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion the Author is describing how immigrants were treated and told to forget who they were because their in @LOCATION1 now."	0	1		1																					
3054	4	In the story �Winter @CAPS1� the author was trying to saying that Saeng was from somewhere then where he is now. In the text It say�s �It was like walking into another world so he is there thinking like no boby know him except for him and him only.	0	0		0																					
3056	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� Saeng took her driver�s test and failed it. She she wants to try and take it again in the spring. I think she ends the story say that because in the spring the hibiscus plant that she got and her and her mom planted, will be growing and blooming and the geese will be back with makes her feel more at home. That way she will feel comfort and be able to take the test and pass, because it will remind her of being home.  	2	2		2																					
3057	4	In the end of the story they say that she will take the test over again, in the spring when the geese come back from the winter fly. What they are saying is that she will make a fresh start in the spring when the geese come back, so she would just be starting all over again fresh new start to a new year and a new time to study for the big test and time to regroup from the last test that she took and failed the test she will just get a new start and a new chance to do something over again. Her mom was in disbelief when she found out that she failed the test, her mom said to her that it will be ok and you can take it over again, in a new season,	1	2		2																					
3058	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is thinking what it will be like when all of this happens. Saeng said; �when they come back, she vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.	0	0		0																					
3059	4	The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to end on a good note and show hope for the future. First, throughout the story Saeng felt lonely and depressed because she missed her home in Vietnam. With all this depression Saeng saw the winter hibiscus that reminded her of her childhood memories. She felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life. The flower represented the light and hope for the future. Next, it shows perserverance factor in the story Saeng fails her drivers test and came home feeling unacomplished. When she says she will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms it shows perserverance and never giving up. Lastly, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and show a positive outlook on life. No matter where you come from with love and perserverance you can overcome any obstacle. Whether it be your school, tests or home with a little hardwork and faith you can achieve.	3	3		3																					
3060	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show thatshe will do this once she  has gotten use to the change of her new country. When she says, �When the geese return� their faint honks and flying overhead are familiar to her now season upon season. Also when the hibiscus is budding because this will remind her of her home in Vietnam seeing flower and hearing these geese will give her the confidence and encouragement to retake the drivers test.	2	2		2																					
3062	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus �decided to end the story with this paragraph because its like a new beginning for saeng. In saeng moves and fails the test .The winter hibiscus comforts her from the memories of where she used to live. It gives her hope and in the winter it wouldn�t be as nice as it would be in the spring. Spring is also time for new beginnings because in the winter everything dies and comes back to life in spring .saeng feels she would take the test as a new beginning. From my personal experience I always do spring cleaning because I want to begin fresh. Spring is also filled with fresh air and gives me inspiration to do good. This could be why saeng wants to take the test in the spring time. Therefore the author of �Winter Hibiscus �decided to end the story with that paragraph because they wanted to show how saeng wanted a new beginning.  	3	2		3																					
3066	4	The author concludes the story with the quote, �when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again,� to show that she is encouraged by the memories of her homeland. For example, in the story it stated that she realized that many things were similar to things in her homeland. As the seasons went by she discovered the similarities. The spring time reminded saeng of her home, so when at comes she will be motivated to take the test again. In conclusion, the author included the quote to show how she is encouraged by memories of her homeland.	1	2		2																					
3068	4	It shows in this time of doubt that she will overcome. In the story the plant showed hope and in showing this gave her hope. All the memories that she recalled had made her sad at first but in the end gave her hope.	1	1		1																					
3069	4	I think the author concludes the story with that statement simply because, mabe he is trying to send out some sort of message to people and get their attention The author also could of concluded the story off with that statement because mabe he Just felt like he need to do that, mabe he didn't have a particular reason for doing it.	0	0		0																					
3070	4	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again"" because its sympatizing Saeng ability to overcome her sorrow and give the test another chance.this is symbolised by when she says ""when the geese return and the hibiscus"" After fail of the test. She wasn't own considering retaking the test, but instead, just wished she could return to her old home and not how to think about it. But much like the geese returning in the spring, she says she will retake the test. She is like the geese because they overcome and adopt the cold harsh weather by flying elsewhere and returning when it's warm, like her she must wait until she is more ready and confident to take the test the second time around. The Hibiscus budding is symbolizing her strength and determination to pass the test the second time she takes it,because just like her the hibiscus survive the cold weather months, @CAPS1 bloom in the spring so must she last through the weather to pass in the spring. That is why the author consider the story with the paragraph to show that she hasn't given up and will take the test again, A sured that  to pass"	2	3		3																					
3071	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is waiting for a better time. It shows that she is has perserverance and will not give up on passing this test. She realizes that life comes and goes very quickly. And thAt she needs to appreciate it	1	1		1																					
3072	4	"The author concluded the last paragraph in the story ""winter Hibiscus"" to say that the narrator ""Saeng"" isn�t given up on her driving test"	1	1		1																					
3073	4	At the end of the story, winter Hibiscus, the author's concluding paragraph shows many of the aspects of the story in a summary, Saeng is determined to go back to the drivers test and is open to a new beginning. The author used these concluding words in the paragraph to express the hope in Saeng of a better beginning and to show her determination to pass the drivers test. The author ties the objects in-a story to represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus is a reminder of her glorious home, spring is the time she picks because it is a new beginning, and the geese returning show the determination of her and her to resolve to become new and better.	2	2		2																					
3075	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sounds better and it makes the story sound a bit more better when the author put that paragraph in the start. If the author did not put that ending at the end of the story the story probably wouldnt be that intresting and be that good of a story if the author didn�t put that ending paragraph at the end of the story. Also the author wants to make the reader understand the story end end or the start all at the same time. For example if there were no good ending at the end of this story no body would want to read at all not a bit so it was a good thing for the author to put a good end stable ending paragraph at the end of the story. I think ic it was a very good paragraph for the end of the story. It just really seemed to mach the story and I could also really understand it a lot better because of the ending paragraph. It was just the perfect ending for this story.	0	0		0																					
3077	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to say in the spring when the plant starts over Saeng will start over to. The story shows that this is the meaning because Saeng was having a really hard winter and was having a hard time adjusting to all of the new things, but in the spring she can start over just like the hibiscus will.	1	1		1																					
3079	4	I think the author concludes this in the story because when they come back is when the character feels she would be prepare to take that test again.	1	1		1																					
3081	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show us that her days with nature is not yet over, for when it comes back around, she will continue to do what she been was doing, whicvh was growing her plants, taking care of them, tuning them out to being a goodnight dinner, and to continue that until she�s no longer to do anymore.	0	0		0																					
3082	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. So when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng still doesn�t like the change and would like to go back to her old home	2	2		2																					
3084	4	The author concludes the stoRy with this paragraph because this spRing she had made a mistake like buying the plants that were oveR @MONEY1 (dollaRs) and her motheR who disappointed with heR. So she figuRes That when The spRing comes again she could get another oppoRtuniy to do her best and to get it right This time. Also so she will not be a disappointment to heR motheR.	1	1		1																					
3086	4	I believe that the author concluded the story �Winter @CAPS1� with the paragraph that she did in order to imply that Saeng will not give up. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was very sad about failing the test, but will take the test again infers that Saeng is a determined person. It is my belief that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the feeling that Saeng was determined despite hardships.	2	1		2																					
3088	4	Mingfong Ho closes the story with that paragraph because it shows how far Saeng has come and her determination to persevere. The narrator says, �She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance �(Ho @NUM1). This is when Saeng is recovering from crying and even though she misses her homeland, she wants to adapt and succeed where she is now. The narrator also said, �she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again� (Ho @NUM1). Being away from her homeland makes Saeng very ??? (not legible)	2	2		2																					
3089	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they feel that the plant will bring them luck or something. Saeng feels that the plant gives her some type of comforte. 	1	1		1																					
3090	4	I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because in the story, the author says �through the quiet repitition of season upon season� which means that seasons will come a seasons will go but she�ll always be there, ready to �take the test�	1	1		1																					
3091	4	The author is probably trying to say in the spring when the seasons change and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding he will take the test again.	0	0		0																					
3092	4	The author concludes that failing the test is not the worst thing. She relizes that times change and you can always get another chance, which is explaned in the last paragh that once the hibiscus buds she will take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3094	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 It mean so many things about her in just one little sentence. For example ""take that test again"" she willing to do it all over again @CAPS1 she love it and want to do it. Also when she said ""in spring; when the snows melts and the gesse return and this hibicous is' budding"" from that when you come back and don't forget about all the things she just list. That why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. "	1	1		1																					
3095	4	This story about believed in yourself, and never giving up it was a story about perseverance. Saeng really believed she could pass her driver's test, and although she was disappointed with result, she found a way to cope with her loss. The hibiscus that flower means a lot to her because she can connect it to her homeland and, and it is a thing of beauty. something she needed at such an ugly time for her. It's always hard o adapt to a new country in a short period of time. I know what it's like when one small thing goes wrong. You can snap and it will feel a lot worse than it actually is. You feel helpless and alone just like the hibiscus growing next to the highway in the photo. Saeng vowed to take her driver�s test again when her hibiscus would bloom in the spring I think the hibiscus really symbolizes Saeng as a person.	2	3		3																					
3096	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons, Saeng was dissapointed for failing her driving test. She found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus his not started to bud, she should not take the drivers test. She feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus. This implies nature comforts her. The author ended it like this because it shows Saeng is not disappointed about failing is anymore. She knows she will have another chance next year when the geese returns and the hibiscus starts to bud. With the comfort of nature, she feels she can pass the test next year.  	2	2		2																					
3098	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows her determination. Saeng is having problems with both adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life. we see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, �she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� we see that Saeng bought the flower because it made her feel securit. It was something from home that felt familiar to her and I believe thats why she included the story with this paragraph because next year she will have a sense of security and familiarity when taking the test because the experience she had will be making again.	2	2		2																					
3099	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up. She also concludes with this to tell people that they should never give up and that the should keep on trying. Even if they have to take a break to study or rethinks the plan.	1	1		1

3110	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho,is about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing �when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test @NUM1). The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on her way home had seen an assortment of flowers that were indigenous to her homeland. �Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost @NUM2) The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged. Her mother states �It�s flowers aren�t as pretty but it�s strong enough. That�s what @NUM3). Saeng , after hearing this, decides that she could be strong, too, and would try to do her best in school. She would adapt just like the winter hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
3111	4	She said that because she was more intrested in flowers tha a test.	0	0		0																					
3112	4	I believe that the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows the ending of one thing and the beginning of another.After she is upset and thinks about home she realizes that something new is happening and she needs to accept it.So therefore  in the spring she is going to start new like the flower blossom.	1	1		1																					
3113	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants to get the point out that the character dosnt want to rush into things she wants to  do right and not take the quick way out.  	0	0		0																					
3115	4	The author ends this story with this paragraph because she is explaining her thoughts and why she is taking that test. She is explaining that next year she will find out if it feels like home to her.	0	0		0																					
3118	4	The author included this because she felt that since Saeng failed the test that maybe she should be given a second chance because she tried so hard before. When Saeng says �Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.� It made her mom upset because she used alot of money for one plant just so she could feel at home again since she had one when she was at her old home. Eventually her mom say, �It�s a beautiful plant� to make her feel better because she feels bad for how she acted towards her daughter. After all the things Saeng had to go through is the reason the author added the the last passage into the story.	1	1		1																					
3119	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph the author is saying that Saeng will not quit until she pass that test she try and try and till she die. The author refering to the story again.	1	1		1																					
3121	4	Because planting flowers and wasting on the garden is @CAPS1 hobby. And without it she can�t think clearly or creating. So there fore waiting until they are back will make her happier also she able to do her work.	0	0		0																					
3123	4	The author of winter Hibiscus , Minfong Ho ended the story in this way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying. �Its flowers aren�t as pretty but it�s strong enough to make it through the winter. That�s what matters. �Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their lives again in @LOCATION1, that @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as pretty, but it will survive, which is what matters. Her words soothe her daughters worries about starting ore. Also, the budding hibiscus could be considered asymbol of rebirth, since it is dying and growing with the seasons.The family is dying in out a @CAPS1 family & being @CAPS2 was an @CAPS3 family. However even though they �died� as a @CAPS1 family, that does not meqan that they have lost their heritage which is why the author end talking about a flower that is both @CAPS1 & @CAPS3 just like Saeng.	3	3		3																					
3125	4	The story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about her �home� where she no longer lived. After she had broke down, bought the plant, and learned to actually accept the fact that she no longer lived in Vietnam and accepting that she had failed her driving test, she realized that she just has to learn to like it. She also learned that her time will come and she will one day be driving. The reason why the auethor concluded the story with this paragraph is because this is the conclusion of the story. this is where one realizes the important things.	1	2		2																					
3129	4	The author ends the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� to show a comparison. Since the plant reminds her of home, when it buds she will be more confident to take the test. When she was looking at the petals of the flower it said, �Gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least she could hold on to.� This shows that she really missed her home, and she had nothing to give her confidence. The flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her drivers test. Saeng felt out of place in her new environment. The flower hibiscus, gave her motivation. It gave her a chance to connect with a part from her old home, in her new home. Saeng thinks, �And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar too�. This shows that this flower was a sentimental importance, she needed. Therefore, the author ended with that paragraph to show a comparison and the importance of the flower to her adapting.  	3	3		3																					
3130	4	"In �Winter Hibiscus,� Minfong Ho ends the story how she does to show a sign of hope. Saeng is going to start over when the world starts over. Spring is the time when animals come out of their winter holes, when trees blossom, and when the snow melts. It is a time of renewed. Saeng �Vowed silently to herself to try again in the spring time.Saeng parchases the hibiscus in remembrance of her homeland, but also to know when it is ready to come back out of the base to try again. The hibiscus does these actions by coming out of its buds and blooming. Ho ends her story in hope of a new beginning. Saeng vows, �Then I will take that test again.� In the word choice of �That test again� depicts her new attitude. She wants to try again, her test.     """	2	2		2																					
3131	4	to show how absent she feels without them by her. You see this when the @ORGANIZATION1 says �when they come back�. also when she says �the geese return & this hibiscus is budding�. Shows how she feel without them and how she will feel when they return and how she will carry on where they left off last time as shown when she says �, Then I will take that test again�.	1	1		1																					
3134	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself and to her mother too. Saeng decided to tell her mother what she had done, �she failed the test� probably her mom get upset with her but then she talk to her again. Saeng  mather�s ask her about the plant that she have with her. Saeng said that she buy the plant by @MONEY1. She was sad because she failed the test and when she buy the plant it probalbly makes her feel better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it bring some kind of hope to her, and she probably will pass the test. When she said �then I will take that test again� @CAPS1 makes her to decide to take it agan it could be the plant.	2	1		2																					
3135	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author want to show the readers that Saeng will want to pass her driver licens test. The reason that so the reader show how detirmen Saeng do after the winter The example is that in the story Saeng fail her driver licens and was sad about. The next example is that when she find this flow she know she do it again. This show that the flower help her feel better show that she will do it again. The first example show that she was sad that she fail the test. At the conclusion the author put this statement in the story to show reader tat Saeng will pass the diver licenc test later on.	1	2		2																					
3137	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to know that she will regain her confidence when the ""hibiscus is budding"" and take another slot at the driving test. He doesn't want to just leave us hanging with the girl watching the geese fly away into the distance. The girl felt very bad about failing the test which makes the reader feel sad. To cheer up the reader, he ended the story in this way. Saeng is reminded of home when ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,� So, the author ends the story having Saeng have a sense of renewed confidence and the reader feeling happy."	2	2		2																					
3142	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph she did because it shows how Saeng is adapting with the change she is going through in @LOCATION1.the winter hibiscus helped her @CAPS1 with Failing her driving test, so Saeng figures it will give her luck when she takes it again. Also the hibiscus will survive, and while she works towards her goal it will develop more. Once the flower blooms, it will symbolize strength, helping Saeng over come this obstacle. Her mother said the flower was not as pretty but will survive. She means @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as great as Vietnam, but Saeng will stay strong.	2	2		2																					
3143	4	The purpose for the ending the Author @CAPS1 is to show how the hibiscus gives Saeng A good sense of comfort, compared to how:- she was At the beginning of the story. It Was like she had very little confidence. And now she is forced to call this strange place home, And that emptied her @CAPS2 to strive until she see�s A very familiar face that brings back her memories of when She was the happiest. Having something Around that was special to her Around All the time can make @CAPS3 feel At home or like it use to be, she found her confort in the Hibiscus. So now that it rests in her garden to constantly grow through All the seasons, She will to with that reminder of her old home and how good it felt, except now with new memories.	2	3		3																					
3144	4	@PERSON1 go to the top and then over the hill.	0	0		0																					
3145	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, �Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,� This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, �Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,� she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person.	2	2		2																					
3146	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he or she feels like the audience should know what saeng is feeling. This paragraph ending shows that saeng will keep trying every spring to grow back her flowers and this shows that Saeng has a lot of potential to make her vowe top herself successful.	1	1		1																					
3147	4	This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the atire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flower and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that save her the courage she needed to retake her driver�s test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, �when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...� At first the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story.	0	0		0																					
3148	4	The author concludes the story this way because in the winter time she wai�t be able to see the hibiscus .she is used to  going outside in the garden and seeing her beautiful plant In conclusion the author concludes the story that way, because in the winter time she wai�t see  her plant.  	0	0		0																					
3150	4	The author concludes the story with that like, to leave the reader guessing. The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve. The author was trying to show how she can change, and grow just like her plant.	2	2		2																					
3151	4	The author used the concludes with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She wrights that because when her flower starts budding she will be able to take the test cause she is like a flower. The author uses the concludes because when the flower is going to budd and the geese come back she will think that she is back home. Thats why I think the author used the conclusion �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.	1	1		1																					
3153	4	I think she concluded with this statement because she doesn�t know if she will pass but she isn�t giving up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she feels bad and the plant helped to cheer her up so when she sees the plant next year she wants to take the test.The plant is like a sign of good luck. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it leaves you with the idea not to give up when times are hard keep trying.  	1	1		1																					
3154	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagein what rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example when the author said �then I will take that test again.� Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story. For example when the author said �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. Those were reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3156	4	In the story Saeng vowed silently to herself, �When the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. For some reason I think that is affine idea Saeng vowed.	0	0		0																					
3158	4	The author concludes this paragraph to the story because, seasons change, plant don�t most likely grow during winter time. So you learn a lesson and take it as it is and a wait until the next time you learn basically the same lesson, when the right time comes.	1	1		1																					
3160	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph so he can tell the overall meaning of the story. Also, the author concludes this paragraph because it is probably a moral to the story and gives you pointes or some events in the story you din�t know about.	0	0		0																					
3162	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the story ends with that phrase to show that Saeng has goals. First, she wants to adapt to the new this new land. This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life. This also says she has precision, she will continue to try to get her license because she says, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She says that she will try again. Also, it exploits that she will get the courage to keep on trying and not give up."	2	2		2																					
3164	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driver�s test. To Saeng her failing the driver�s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng�s promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didn�t give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.     	3	2		3																					
3167	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the �test� again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng�s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she �failed the test�, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow.	3	3		3																					
3171	4	I think the author ended the story with that sentence because every winter all or most plants die off, and during the spring the would have to start all over in growing this plant.	0	0		0																					
3172	4	The authoR ends the STORY this way because their trying To show that Saeng will be dedicated To the hibiscus gardening and once she proves herself she will have passed the test. It also shows that she wants her heritage to be a major part of her life by growing their nations flower 	0	0		0																					
3174	4	The author concluded the story the way they did because it left hope .Saeng hod been hurt anddissappointed but in the end she had shown hope in the story Saeng failedher driving test. She was very disappointed . In The endit  showed she was not going to quit in this new country . She was going to move on and make the best of what she has.	1	1		1																					
3177	4	The author concludes the last paragraph to show that after a time period you can come back and try something again. Or maybe when weather change this can be different for Saeng. Maybe she is relating herself to the plant as to when it come to spring  the flower will be stronger, and she feel that she will pass the test second time around when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. And it also shows how she appriate the nature because if not, why would she wait until spring and when the snow is melting. The conclusion of the story is that she do like nature, because she talk about the hibiscus.	1	2		2																					
3179	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, �and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.� I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home. 	2	3		3																					
3182	4	"The author of this story was smart to end it by saying she will take the test again in the spring, when every thing bloms. This girl just  failed her driving test she dose not want to take it right away. The blomming of the hibiscus symbolizes her old life at her old home and it is also symbolizing a new start when it bloms. This will give her the confodence to pass her driving test and make he excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return�. This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and fells contible, at home you are contible. The author ended this story of this girl, Saeng, with hope and drive to do what she wants to do. That is why it was smart to end the story like they  ended it.  "	2	3		3																					
3184	4	"In the Story the @CAPS1 concluds the story with the sentance ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think he ends it this way because she has accepted that she failed or lost but is willing to try again to accomplish her goal and ""take that test again"". Also she is making a promise, or a vow to her self and to not give up on her goal."	2	1		2																					
3186	4	The author is expressing hope for the future in her concluding paragraph although just failing her drivers test and adjusting to a new atmoshere Saeng finds comfort in a Hibiscus. �it felt smooth an cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel.� This expresses that the rememberence of �an old friend� was able to lift her spirits after a previous dissappoinment it was obvious Saeng was uncomfortable in her environment, which her mother noticed when she arrived at home. �she paused as she noticed the tear stains on her a daughter�s cheecks and her puffy eyes.� Her daughter was not adjusting to her new atmosphere and even though she had spent a lot of money on a single flower she understood. With all the negative attitude through out the story, once Saeng saw the geese and planted her �winter� hibiscus, she realized what was strange to her before had now become familiar. Saeng finally realizes with a memory of home, her goals can be accomplished and life can be stable somewhere other than home. She illustrates that from failurecomes success.	2	3		3																					
3188	4	She is  saying that ryt now, is not the right time to table the tst, she is saying that she is going to wait to care back until spring, when the flowrs we blooming to take the test, @CAPS1 she is so acentric abought the exotic flowers, She can�t stand to do it now, when the time isn�t right. So she is saying that she is going to wait until the time is right to take the test.	0	0		0																					
3189	4	Saeng will take the test in the spring when it�s not so cold. She likes it when the hibicus is budding they smell so good. They good smell reminders her of her native contrey. Saeng likes fried melon, it leaves a golden after taste on your tongue. She would poter it over a Big mac. 	1	1		1																					
3190	4	These are many reason why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3193	4	"The reason why the author concludes this paragraph is to show saeng that she will be waiting for them to grow back and she will try again for her test. Hibiscus means a lot to her, and will keep trying because she doesnt want her mother disappointed in her again. Example of wher saeng felt shame ""her mother stared at her incredulously. But how could you?"" saeng wants to not down herself or her mother. ""saeng vowed silently to herself"" saying a promise that she will pass and respect nature as well as elders"	1	1		1																					
3194	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� by minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is buddling , then I will take the test again,� @CAPS1 author concludes the story in this way because it is somewhat of a cliffhanger. In the story, @CAPS2 is upset about failing her driving test and she has just moved from Vietnam to the united states and so she is a little homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up ??? reminding being alike the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng hasn�t given up and that she is going  to try and pass the drivers license test again. But what you don�t know is the end result of whether she passes or not and so it is a cliffhaofer. That is why the author ended the story in this way.	2	2		2																					
3195	4	Saeng has been the victim of a tragic  loss  in  family  and also  a move  to  a totally different  world. The paragraph  is  symbolic  of  turning over a new leaf and starting over.The �snows  melting� and �hibiscus bidding� are both symbolizing  new life.Saeng is going to have a outlook on life and accept  her situation to  make  the  best  of  it. Also, the  author say �the  winter  hibiscus  was  in the ground now� as  it does compare to saengs new found  outlook  planted on life. Like the flower, a seed of hope was planted into Saeng, and now she is ready to blossom.	2	2		2																					
3196	4	In the story, �winter hibiscus�, by @ORGANIZATION1, the author is very sentimental over the Hibiscus plant because it reminds he so much of her home. The reason why the author conclude the story with that saying was because it gave her a goal. She failed once at getting a job, but she @MONTH1 believe that the Hibiscus is good luck so she sets a goal on when to try for the job again. When she saw the plant, she remembered happy memories. In conclusion, certain things can trigger your memories, but its the good memories that make things in life something to wait and hope for.	1	1		1																					
3199	4	The author concludes the paragraph with this paragraph because she wants to try again. The author is saying that the hibiscus she planted @DATE1 did not work and she is trying again this @DATE1 to grow a hibiscus plant. She will pass the test if she succeds in the spring. That is why the author concludes with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3200	4	He concludes that when it is spring he will take the test again. That will give her another chance to pass it. This will give her another chance to do what is right.	1	1		1																					
3202	4	"In �Winter Hibiscus� the author @CAPS1 sentence is �When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"".. I think the rememberence of home will help her take the test. She use to the geese and plant to remind her of home and by having these surroundings makes her comfortable"	1	1		1																					
3205	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I believe she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, someday being symbolized by when the geese come back. Saeng is sad because she missis her homeland and she sees plants that bringback memories, so she buys a winter hibiscus to ease & comfort her & remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
3207	4	At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work. Instead  she rather garden then do school work.	0	0		0																					
3208	4	The author  concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus gave her some hope. Also , because her mother was understanding  about  her  failing the test. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph .	1	1		1																					
3209	4	The author concludes the story with optimism and hope for the future. She finishes her story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. By concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test. The hibiscus the helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before, through the quit repition of season upon season, almost femiliar to her now.�  In the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season.	3	2		3																					
3212	4	The reason why this author includes this story with this paragraph is because it is still talking about saeng and that is more like her and that she has a mind like a butterflye that was trapped a burst out with this open the Saeng and her mom had but a tennage girl me and saeng we kind relate to the same thing.	0	0		0																					
3213	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I think the ending paragraph is there to show that Saeng has not given up. She says, �When they come back�then I will take that test again.� She is talking about the hibiscus and the geese. The things that remind her of home. When the reminders of home come and give her strength, she will have the power to take the test. This shows that even though she has failed she will not give up and she will try again. I think that is the purpose of the paragraph. To show Saeng hasn't given up.  	2	2		2																					
3217	4	The author concludes this story by saying this statement because the author want you to feel like the character in the book is determined. The ator is trying to put across a statement saying  get through then try again. The character is not giving up, and she will get through the test eve though its hard.	1	1		1																					
3219	4	The reason why is so you get the feeling that Saeng feels about gardening. She is praying for spring to come so she can do it over again. She like to watch plants grow and become something that you can eat. That is way the Author concluded the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3220	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show determination and hope. The geese and the  hibiscus symbolize saeng�s determination, because they always come back no matter what. Saeng will be back to take the test , just like the geese will also be back. The hibiscus also symbolize her because it has faced adversity also. It has been taken to new paces and had new homes, much like saeng , and has a harsh winter coming in the near future.  However , it  always  finds a way to come back and bloom in the spring, which is what saeng hopes to do by taking the driver�s test. The author included the last paragraph to show symbolism between saeng  ,the  geese , and the hibiscus.That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.    	3	3		3																					
3221	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he basicly trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might mean through seasons. She @MONTH1 think that she would have better on her test in the spring only for the simply fact that everything blooms in the spring.	1	1		1																					
3223	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in th spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph is that what happens to his life that he will take the test again. But in the story it talks about. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it So I think that they take care of there garden and try to make it live in the winter. So thats what I think about the last paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	1	1		1																					
3226	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" at the end of the story the author writes ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again."" The reason why the author said that Is because she Is trying to tell the readers to get right back up and do it again, If you fell once there Is no harm and trying again. When its spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promise to take the drive's test. After failing a driver test Saeng buys a flower at a florIst that remInded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and put it in the garden. Told her mother that she fail, Saeng's mother was very understand and told her maybe next time In conclusion the author �write the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life.  "	1	2		2																					
3231	4	The �Winter Hibiscus� is a realativly sad, but hopeful story that uses lots of symbols. The author concluded the story with a confident ending that makes the reader feel satisfied. The two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring. �Winter Hibiscus� ends with a hopeful tone thanks to the confident vow Saeng silently makes. She had a rough day, and the author wanted to make sure she had something to look as a goal. It also reveals how strong of a person Saeng is. The author uses this conclusion paragraph to leave the reader with a hopeful and confident tone. The second reason the author concluded with that conclusion paragraph was to relate some of the objects she sees to the spring. The geese represent the new place she is living in, and the hibiscus represents her old home. This paragraph links these two symbols together, so the reader can relate them to the spring. The way the author concluded the story was brillantly done. It represents a hopeful tone, and symbols that relate to spring. It ends confidently, and leaves the reader satisfied.  	2	3		3																					
3232	4	I think author concludes the with this paragraph because she wants to not give up. For example, he wants to show  us never give up at anything even if you fail. Therefore, that�s why he ends like that.	1	1		1																					
3233	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted to get her point across. also because she wanted to create an under standing of the complexitier of the passage. The author wanted the reader to feel her message as if they were there to witness it.	0	0		0																					
3236	4	The author of �winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with �when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.�Saeng, because it creates the mood that Saeng is accepting the changes. Just like nature adapts to climate and location change, saeng seems to appreciate her situation and is deciding her situation and is deciding to make it a positive instead of a negative. The author is showing that if your having trouble, try again; through the main character, Saeng.	2	2		2																					
3238	4	Minfong Ho concluded �Winter Hibiscus� with the lines �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� to show that there is always hope for better things to come. Saeng had become sad because she remembered her home in Vietnam. She longed for her natural home and familiarity. Her missed memories agonizingly hurt Saeng because she was now for away and in a different world. However, the author started to reveal hints that @ORGANIZATION1 would accept @LOCATION2 and find come childhood memories there too. �Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and �yes- familiar to Saeng now.� Already, Saeng was growing familiar with her surrounding area in @LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would keep her @CAPS1 culture, tradition, and memories alive, as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in @LOCATION2. As one kept her @CAPS1 and �@CAPS3 culture alive through memories, she would continue a successful life and pass her test. That is why Minfong Ho ended �Winter Hibiscus� with the particular paragraph.	3	2		3																					
3239	4	The author concludes the story in winter hibiscus, Kind of funny/ weird like . The concluding sentence is �when they come back saeng vowed silently to herself in the  spring, when  the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I know one thing the part of the title is in the concluding sentence, so it is basically it is concluding the whole  story, plus the characters	0	0		0																					
3240	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready. The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.	2	2		2																					
3243	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring it�s warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.	0	0		0																					
3246	4	"The author concluded the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can survive through hard times and adapt to changes, and survive she can also. Saeng icoms that even though she has moved to the United States and it is different she is strong enough to survive. Failing her drivers test dosent mean that she is incapable of anything, but trying again with a fresh start like the hibiscus."	2	2		2																					
3247	4	The author concludes the story with this @CAPS1 the author wants to show Saeng hasn�t given up. Easly in the story Saeng goes to the green house and starts to cry. When she gets home she says to her mother, �I-I failed the test.� @CAPS1 of this Saeng wanted to go back and try again. That is why the author ended with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3249	4	The author include the last paragraph because Saeng is not going to give up. and she will try again. I think Saeng bought the flower because she had them at her home land and it will help her. For example Saeng started to cry because she miss her homeland.	1	1		1																					
3250	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he things when the flowers come back they would be batter. I think the he thinks that it would be a better test next time	1	1		1																					
3263	4	Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. �when the snow melts and the geese return� This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things.	2	2		2																					
3264	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she�s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here. She�s said  and does lots of fun things.	0	0		0																					
3267	4	She can�t wait till the flowers start to come back when the snow melts so it isn�t very cold out so they grow and she is going to take her test that she has failed when the geese and flowers come back.	1	1		1																					
3268	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng, like the geese and the hibiscus, will return again and have hope. Saeng is a little depressed in the story because she is in a new country, and just failed her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back painful emotional memories for her, but at the same time, s very comforting. Later in the story, she plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother. As her mother goes inside, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead. �Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Like the geese.� Saeng knew the geese would return in the spring, just like she would to her driving test. The hibiscus would be in bloom again too to provide her with hope. This is what the final paragraph in the story �winter hibiscus� means.	3	2		3																					
3269	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng�s everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng�s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace.	1	2		2																					
3271	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph that she did because it was the end and the start of a new beggining. The author uses the sensens in her story. The winter is the current season and spring is on its way. Although Saeng failed her test in the winter when most things die, she is looking forward to spring to start again on her test. The geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life. Saeng will also have new life in her test to pass it this time and drive. The spring season will come and new life will be provided to all.   	2	2		2																					
3272	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is like say most of the story but in a small and shorter way.	0	0		0																					
3274	4	I believe that the author  concludes the story with this paragraph because it's what the story is all about it just exploins what happened in the end as if what happeed through the story was the growth and living of a flower.	0	0		0																					
3275	4	"The story  �Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho. The author concludes the story in a what seems like incomplete paragraph. The girl Saeng vows to take her driver test over when the spring comes. when Saeng was holding the plant, she felt cold and halpless like how the plant did. ""Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, it's leaves quivering in the wind."" By Saeng's mother reassuring her that she was okay with her choice it made Saeng grow as a person, ""I'm glad you got it."" @CAPS1 mother also says, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing."" That in a way describes Saeng clinging to stay connected with her country. Saeng�s mother also tells her of now the plant will surely survive. When the spring comes the plant will be just as strong, and so will Saeng. Which is why the author leaves off where she did"	1	3		2																					
3276	4	The author concludes the story by showing the girl�s connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese, the �Winter hibiscus� is her connection to her homeland. She said she�ll retake her driving test when her plant buds and is brave, so she will do the same. The geese flying south show her journey as a person because she will take the test when the geese come back from their journey, as she comes back from hers.	2	2		2																					
3277	4	The author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. All throughout the story there was depresing nogistalistic tone that made the reader yearn for the past. The author wanted to put on emphisis on being strong even though you @MONTH1 not enjoy where you are at. Also the author wanted to show the strength of the main of the main character Saeng. Even though she has just failed a test in a new, strange world she still wishes to continue pushing foward. This adds more demension the the character and makes her less static and more dynamic. This is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward.	2	2		2																					
3278	4	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to get some roots in the new soil she is on. When she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time.	2	1		2																					
3280	4	�when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author has left her home and moved to another country. She is now in an unfamilar place. Everything that now surrounds her is new and mostly un-known. By ending the story with this quote, it suggest that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home. When she left her home, she did not just leave a building behind. She left her home, people she loved, and an endless list of memories. At times she @MONTH1 have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now �out of the box,� and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and �failed her test.� The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own test of adapting.  	3	2		3																					
3281	4	"The author concludes as the story with the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself., in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" mean that she will take the test and hoped she pass so she could make her mother happy and support her. She chosee spring because spling is the rebirth of nature and Saeng would like to retake the test with a clear and clean mind. I think that the reason why the author choose to put the paragraph in the end of the story. "	1	1		1																					
3283	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver�s test. �She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. �This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she�ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2.	2	2		2																					
3284	4	The author concluded this story with the paragraph because, Saeng is explaing to the reader�s that she will take the test again when the time is right. When things seem to be getting better she will retake the test. That is why the authour used that paragraph to conclude her story.	1	1		1																					
3286	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the girl Saeng @CAPS1 the drivers test ""I-I failed the test"" said Saeng. She had bought a hibiscus because the flower remined her of some of the memories from home and the hibiscus she had at herhouse. at the end she says that she will retake the test when the geese come back, the snow has melted and the hibiscus is budding. She does this I think because she needs time to just think things through to just remember back home and to make a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is just like Saeng. They both did something wrong or @CAPS1 something Saeng failed the test and the hibiscus was constrited to a pot. But they both are going to change the bad thing.."	1	2		2																					
3288	4	"In the story ""WiNter Hibiscus"" by MiNFOnG HO the author concludes the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the sprinG, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddiNG, then I will take that test again"". The author concluded the story with that @CAPS1 because she is sayinG that when the year starts OFF @CAPS2 and starts over, that she will too. She's sayinG that when the Geese @CAPS3 back, the snow melts, and the Hibiscus starts to bud that they all start over and start a @CAPS2 beGiNNiNG. So when she Goes to take the test it will be a @CAPS2 year."	1	2		2																					
3292	4	"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says �When they come back� she is talking about the flowers. When the come back alive. �In the spring� shows when the flower will come back. �When the snows melt and the geese return� she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring). �And this Hibiscus is budding� She is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring. � Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!"	1	2		2																					
3293	4	The author concluded the story with that ending because in the spring when everything blossoms. And she wouldnt be focused while there is snow. So when the hibiscus is budding, thats when she will be able to take her test again. I think he wrote that because it means something to her.	1	0		1																					
3294	4	This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, �She lifted her head.� This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, �when the snow melts and the geese return,� this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, �and this hibiscus budding� she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it�s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring.	2	3		3																					
3295	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of reasons.	0	0		0																					
3298	4	The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing to indifferent things; Flowers & taking a test. That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence.	1	1		1																					
3299	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. The next time it blooms the girl will be ready for the test and will take it again and will pass. The authour  wants to show that the girl will not give up and will try again to make sure she passes. The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test.	1	2		2																					
3300	4	Well, I think the author concludes the story with that sentence because maybe Saeng likes the spring and can concentrate better with her favorite flower that she thinks relates to her life.	1	1		1																					
3301	4	"The author ends the story like that to show the theme working hard, Some other examples of working hard are the �winter hibiscus."" Another example is her vow to pass the test, so that is why the author ends the story that way."	1	1		1																					
3302	4	The author concludes the story with they paragraph that they did because it's about the same thing that they opened the story with.  To introduce the story, the author tells about Saeng failing her drivers test, and then seeing a familiar plant that she wants to buy. The middle of the story is about how she is having a hard time adapting to her new home. So to conclude the story, the author puts that Saeng will take her drivers test again, once the flowers starts budding, and the geese come out. The flower and the geese remind her of home, so this tells you that thinking of her home, and the objects that make her feel at home, comfort her, and help her overcome obstacles.	2	2		2																					
3303	4	Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these tequniques a story @MONTH1 seem bland average or unattractive. Author Minfong Ho canverys the fact that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of simply stating the fact that she will retake the test, he has her make a promise on the geese that she will. The Author ended the story like this show how strongly she felt about the test.	0	0		0																					
3307	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back� and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."	1	1		1																					
3308	4	The short story �Winter Hibiscus� as written by author Minfong Ho, ends with main character Saeng, promising herself that in the spring when the geese return and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, that she would re-take her failed drivers test. Mingfong Ho, writes this story, with heavy imagery and symbolism, the hibiscus found in the floral shop, represents a connection for Saeng to her homeland, and the bittermellon, which is loved by Saeng, but unbearable to people in @LOCATION1 ,represents Saeng�s hard time connecting to people in @LOCATION1. And for Saeng, the budding hibiscus, and returning geese, are representative of a new opportunity to pass her drivers test, and better adapt to life in @LOCATION1.	3	3		3																					
3309	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wanted to show that Saeng doesn�t give up and that nature gives @CAPS1 strength. The conclusion shows that Saeng doesn�t give up by saying that she is going to take the test again, even though she failed it earlier that day. Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by saying that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return, when hibiscus buds and when the snow melts in spring nature gives her strength because it reminds her of where they used to live and her grandmother. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature gives her strength and confidence.	2	2		2																					
3310	4	The character, Saeng, experiences both internal and external conflicts. Saeng had failed her driver�s test and stilled missed Vietnam. The ending of the story was an excellent choice of conclusion for the story. The flock of @CAPS1 geese represented her changes. She used to foot awkward and out of places. Many things were new to her. Saeng realized that life isn't so bad for her. The planting of the �winter hibiscus� represented her change as well. It showed how she will start new and continue happily. Saeng will �plant a new seed.� The ending was well chosen for the story because it foreshadows Saeng�s future. The story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect.	2	2		2																					
3311	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng relates the hibiscus overcoming of problems to her own overcoming of problems. Saeng is comparing the hibiscus to herself. If the hibiscus can adapt to its surroundings, then so can she. And if the hibiscus makes it through the winter, then she too can make it; and she will re-take the test that she failed before. Also, before this she says that things that were once strange to her now seemed familiar, like the geese. She then see�s them overhead flying in a V. They are also adapting to their surroundings by flying to a warmer place, and Saeng too can adapt.	2	2		2																					
3313	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because it shows Saeng will not give up. Saeng failed her drivers test and as she was walking home she found a hibiscus. It reminder her of her old home. Saeng goes to the green house or flowershop and buys one. When she returns she plants the hibiscus. The hibiscus is keeping her from giving up. When it starts budding, @PERSON1 will take the test again.	2	1		2																					
3317	4	I would say that the author concluded this story ently paragraph because they wanted to be very consist. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and understanding of the text. In brief words.	0	0		0																					
3318	4	The reason why they include the story with the paragraph is because they talk about the same thing. Then they probably included the story with the paragraph might have been to show the good relationship between the mother and daughter and how they can do things together. Then in the story they talk about going to Canada together.	0	0		0																					
3322	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because he is showing that she will not give up and she will do it when she is ready to. The reason I say this is because she is doing the test when she wants to, when she feels comfortable. Those are the reasons I belive that the author ended the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3326	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver�s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
3328	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do.	1	1		1																					
3329	4	The author is very creative. He concludes the story saying how the hibiscus is building and that she will take the test agian. She believes that she will do better when the snow is gone. The author ended the story with that because Saeng was very upset failing a test but with the comfort of the hibiscus she�ll be able to do better. He also concludes the story with that paragraph because the climax was when she failed her test and somehow the author had to conclude what was going to happen to Saeng  with the test	1	1		1																					
3330	4	He concludes the story like thot because the test was the main thing thot he was talking about.	0	0		0																					
3334	4	They ended it because the girl is not going to give up. She is going to keep trying at this test and wont stop at it eaither. And she will be alittle brighter. She will also pass this test. And this way she wont disappoint her mother. And she will be able to get this test of of her sholders.	1	1		1																					
3338	4	In the story the author concludes that after shes done her test and there's nothing that to see she'll grow more.	0	0		0																					
3339	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph she did because the girl did not pass the driving test. And she adds all of them details of nature in there because she takes time to care about nature. That is what it is mainly about in the story.	1	1		1																					
3340	4	I am guessing the author adds this paragraph to tell the reader that when all of the beauty returns, she will try to get used to new thing again.	0	0		0																					
3341	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus is a reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong and she compares herself to the geese saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter the hibiscus doesn�t bloom and Saeng fails her driver�s test. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the Hibiscus thrives and the geese return it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well.   	2	2		2																					
3346	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years.	1	1		1																					
3349	4	He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants.	1	2		2																					
3351	4	The flowers on this bush are very comforting to Saeng. In the story she explains that they remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of plant and spring represent new life. Saeng thinks that spring could also have a new beginning for her. That in spring, she will do better and pass the test. But, if she falls again, the flowers will have bloomed to comfort her.	2	2		2																					
3353	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she failed the test so over the winter they don�t get hibiscus but over the spring when they get again the hibiscus she will try to take the taste again so she can pass it	1	1		1																					
3354	4	The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it.	1	1		1																					
3355	4	Minfong Ho, the author of �  Winter Hibiscus � concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself that she will retake and pass her drivers test in the spring when the geese fly back and plant rebuds. The author concluded the story with this paragraph   to signify Saeng�s   willingness to start over. After failing a test, Saeng visits a green house and misses her old home, Vietnam. She buys a hibiscus and plants it when she comes home after noting the geese flying south for the   Winter. The plant signifies her memories. When she first sees it, it�s blossomed. In the spring it will rebud  and form another blossom while growing bigger. This parallels Saeng   getting over her sadness and homesickness and rebuilding   better memories while growing stronger. When she gets  the chance. The birds flying  overhead are headed south for the winter for shelter from the cold. In spring they will return to start over raise goslings, rebuild their home, start over from last spring. Saeng is planning to start over, and pass it so she can drive and feel more accepted in @LOCATION2. Minfong   Ho, chose to end the story with a paragraph to signify the character�s starting over and rebuilding good memories.	3	3		3																					
3359	4	"The author concluded ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to tell the reader never give up and to keep trying. It also tells us that family is always there because you can't do it on your own. ""It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng- noi"", she finally said"	1	1		1																					
3360	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the authore is trying to show the reader that she realized cares about the nature and loves It so because she is waiting for the spring and as soon as the spring comes she will take the test again. So in my opinion the author wants to show the readers that the character in story cares a lot about the natures baety.	1	1		1																					
3361	4	The author concludes the story with the sentence saying �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again� because the hibiscus is not as a good luck charm, when it�s not there things aint right but when it comes back thing�s then out for the better. Also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed. Last one not story this let�s the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well	2	1		2																					
3362	4	The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng�s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced. The hibiscus is �strong enough to make ith through the cold months here� that is what matters,� this makes a connection between the plant and the author�s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she�ll wait until spring to take the test again.   	3	2		3																					
3363	4	Saeng is trying to say that when the time comes again that she will take the test. The author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test. The auther also does this to show that you should never quit like if the flower can survive winter then she will be able to survive that test. Also the author is saying that when the seasons change, things change. She was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence. Also she cherished the plant because she wants to see it budding because her and her mother spent quality time dve to this plant she had.	2	1		2																					
3365	4	The author ended the story that way to show that Saeng won�t give up and is determined to complete her task. The author wants the reader to understand Saeng�s very sad and wants to overcome being homesick. Saeng is very much like the hibiscus plant, she�s frail and beautiful. Saeng says she will do her test again when the hibiscus is budding, almost like she�s growing along with the plant. 	2	1		2																					
3367	4	One it could mean she can only take the test in the spring. But also because her surroundings during that period relaxed heR. When she was dissapointed and @CAPS1 about her driving failing grade.	1	1		1																					
3368	4	The author concludes the story with this @CAPS1 because she really cared the hibiscus. She said this because she was comparing her test to the hibiscus. When the hibiscus will budding she will take the test again. Hibiscus is everything far her. it is her good luck. And with hibiscus budding she can make her new life. withaut the hibiscus plant she was laser �I-I failed the test� and �I baught it,� saeng answered reading her mother�s next questian.� She was so depressed with her test failing that why she baught hibiscus to influence her life. she decided when it will spring with hibiscus budding she will start her new life by giving the test again and providing her self how important hibiscus	1	2		2																					
3369	4	The author is concluding that anything can happen in the story. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus and her mother was getting mad at her. Saeng�s mother was mad because she spent money on the whole plant instead of planting it and then it would be a lot cheaper. When her mother was mad and in disbelief, Saeng started crying and the mother forgave her for her actions. This shows that anything can happen	1	1		1																					
3374	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She could want the people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start up again so will Saeng. Ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and geese restarts their lives Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but instead re-take the test. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves you thinking so then the sequel will be about the start of Saeng�s new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 love having people wonder about whats coming next. The people will go home and wonder what will the author do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer.	2	2		2																					
3375	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the willingness of Saeng to overcome the obstacles and adapt to her new life. The hibiscus discussed in the ending quote describes Saeng�s new hope and determination to succeed in the United States. For example in the text it states,""� its fine petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.� When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to the together her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents newhope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually succeed. In addition, in the text it says, �it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.� Saeng�s past memones could be reached when this hibiscus was in new and that served as immense inspiration to her. The author ended the story with Saeng�s new recollection and hope to prove that she had indeed found something helpful and stable in a new world."	3	3		3																					
3376	4	The author concluded the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to portray to her reader that even though Saeng was experiencing a hardship leaving her old home behind, she could still find a good life with new beginning here. In the final paragraph the winter shows represent hard times in the past, while the spring represents a more optimistic future, and a new beginning. Although Saeng was grieving at the lass of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story she once knew hibiscus cran her did home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home. Also, the story says.� Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This quote leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can appreciate happly live in this new home. The final paragraph says,�.. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.� When things familiar to her and things their remind her of her old home come back, Saeng will have the strength to try to accomplish good things for this new life in a new home again.	3	3		3																					
3378	4	The story ands with that paragraph because Saeng believes next spring when her new hibiscus is born she will have good luck to pass her driving test. It is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the drivers test. Now she beleives that on her next driving test she will have the connection to her past experiences, ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort in a time of disappointment. Which Saeng thinks can help her pass the test.	2	1		2																					
3380	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng�s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says �vowed� to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� familiar.� The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time.	2	2		2																					
3381	4	In the story, �winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. That is why she bought the flowers. At the end of the story she vows,� In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home.	2	1		2																					
3385	4	The ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story. It is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader. In the end of the story Winter Hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement. The conclusion encourages you to keep trying, because it states that next year when the flower blooms Saeng will re-take the test. This shows encouragement because has the drive to try again and to pass. The author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is strong and also seems to recap the stories meaning because all along Saeng keeps getting disapointed about the flower, her mother, and homeland encourage her to move on and try again. The ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was truly trying to convey	2	1		2																					
3387	4	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph about geese to show that Saeng is going to try to overcome her obstacles. She was @CAPS1 disappointed in failing the test so she took comfort in memories of her homeland. She bought a hibiscus that she saw in her homeland a lot, and that flower @CAPS2 comfort and affection. But it also @CAPS2 her ability to come over obstacles, and while she was planting her hibiscus, and saw the geese flying above, she knew she had to try again.	2	1		2																					
3388	4	The author  says this because she will try to start her own garden. Her other garden didn�t turn out to well. In the book it says she needed her moms help. 	0	0		0																					
3391	4	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding; then I will take that test again. The author concludes this story Winter Hibiscus with this paragraph because in the story it's about Saeng and she fails her drivers test, and notice a familiar plant which causes her to go to a florist shop. As Saeng learns about this familian plant it encourages her to retake that drivers test, to where as though the snow is gone and the sun is shining.	1	1		1																					
10535	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say in the spring when the snow goes away and the hibiscus start growing she will test the plant again       	0	0		0																					
10536	4	""The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng still has hope to succeed and adapt in this new country. She previously had a lot of home sickness, missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her child hood. The height of her homesickness is seen when Saeng comes back to her house and is explaining to her mother the nature of the hibiscus. �She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� Saeng is uncomfortable living in @LOCATION1 and wishes to go back to Vietnam. Butt by the end, Saeng�s attitude changes from despair to hope. Even though she has failed her driver�s test. Saeng is determined and hopeful to do at least something in this new country by saying ""...then I will take the test again.� Saeng has changed a good deal within this story and that change in attitude is seen with the exerpt on geese in the last paragraph."	3	2		3																					
3393	4	This author concludes the story with this paragraph, because they both where talking about the cold or the weather and the @CAPS1 so it sated when snows melt as it talkes about weather or the @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
3395	4	"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to illustrate the oevrall message of the story. That paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles. Saeng is coming from another country and is facing challenges not only in the garden, but in her life as well. She had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, by saying ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� she truly shows her determination and how shes not afraid to overcome obstacles that will face her. "	2	2		2																					
3400	4	There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, �Winter Hibiscus,� in the way that she did. �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here�� is what Saeng�s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states ��she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become�almost familiar to her now.� Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time.	3	3		3																					
3402	4	"Minfong Ho, the author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" ended her story with @ORGANIZATION1 thinking about the spring because she wanted to make @ORGANIZATION1's future more hopeful. The character @ORGANIZATION1 seemed depressed and always reminiscient of her past in Vietnam. When she sees the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers she ""brokedown and wept"", and she remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells the Jasmine. To make maTters worse for Saeng she failed her driving test, which is something that most teens find as a big disappointment. By this point in the story I felt sorry for @ORGANIZATION1 and I wonderd if things would get better for her because she was away from everything she knew and loved with just some memories and a winter hibiscus unlike the kind she had back at her name in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, @ORGANIZATION1 suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.�    "	2	3		3																					
3404	4	In guessing that it means that when winter or spring or whatever its harder to grow that garden. Also mabe its a challenge of some sort to make the garden grow by that time of year. So I would assume thats what its talking about with it.	1	1		1																					
3405	4	The  author includes that sentence of the end of the story because through out the story it was showing  courage,and that explains her getting better and showing  courage that she is going to go back and try to pass that test and not letting it get her down that she failed the first time.	1	1		1																					
3406	4	To me I would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons. To explain it could mean new begining or starting over. For example, when the geese fly away and came back, that means that the @CAPS1 are changeing. So with that being said, the @CAPS1 changing or starting over could represent his chance to take test can start over, and he will get another chance.  	2	1		2																					
3407	4	I think they think it will bring them luck	1	1		1																					
3409	4	The author includes the exccept at the end for a meaning reason to Saeng. the hibiscus symbolizes everything, her home, her past, and her comfort. Saeng feels that if the flower can bloom, so can she. Which will enable her to get used to her new home and retake the test. It also resembles hope, because if the plant can make it through the winter and bloom in the spring, so can she. The author used this to connect the feelings of Saeng with the realistics of the flower bloomability.	2	1		2																					
3413	4	The author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement. �When the geese come back � in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.� This statement shows renewal and persistance. I think she added this because after realizing the plant can come back time and time again, even after the harsh weather, she knew she could do it too. She vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew  herself and get back on track. It conveys persistance also. The plant doesn�t die each season. It�s hardy and comes back. If the girl can be persistant and come back next year to retake the test, she will be considered persistant. I think the girl wants to be just like flower. She sees it as being indomitable, renewing and beautiful. No matter where the plant is being grown, it will always keep those traits.	2	2		2																					
3414	4	The reason for the author concluding the following is because she wants it to be known to the readers that saeng is not going to just give up because she fails it the first time. That she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make a effort. It states that saeng will retake the test again in the spring when the snow has done melted and geese returns and this hibiscus is budding. Not only was the hibiscus an important part to the story, it was a very important part to her life it help her move on a see how things change cause over time it will chage and develop and adapt to the changes around it. Yes it was a disappointment to her mother but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home. It might comforted her in a way. There was many different things probably going on where she was she missed the test it wasn�t home. She has to adjust and adapt to the situation that she is in. 	2	3		3																					
3417	4	The author included this because she was showing that it was winter and the flower was goin to bloom and the geese were flying here because it is cold. Also the author said that because the story title is called the �Winter Hibiscus� which obviously blooms in the winter so that is why I think the author said what she did.	0	0		0																					
3422	4	I think  the author concluded the story like that is because it was cold outside. I also think that the author is trying to say is that when she wrote this letter it was cold outside and she wouldn�t take the test until it was warm again because of the cold. �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again.� 	0	0		0																					
3423	4	There are many reasons the author says �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again .� @CAPS1 the author said this because the girl left everything just to come to this country and she can not fail. The gil said  �That at last , she could hold on to. But where was the fine-foothed come? the hibiscus hedge? She also said this because the hedge was all she had from her old home besides her mother and when the �hibiscus is budding� means its starting a new life and is starting to grow leafs and the girl is starting grow and move on with her life. 	2	2		2																					
3424	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because if the author trys it again it might work out a lot better now they know what they are doing. Also if they try it again then if it makes enough they can sell it and make money so they will keep doing it for years to come.	0	0		0																					
3426	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because It show what Saeng will be doing and If she will go to school. Saeng didn't want to go school because she will wait For the snow to melt ond the geese return and this hibiscus is bucking, and prefers gardening to school. and garden remind For about her homeland. For @CAPS1 Saeng dug out hole and carefully lowered the winter hibiscus into it. The thing that made her thing about her homeland was the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan, The pungent smell of better melon wafled out. Another @CAPS1 she went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground, that show she care about the garden.	1	1		1																					
3432	4	In my opinion the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was feeling down about not passing her driving test but when she saw those flowers she realize when she came to @CAPS1 she  forget all about her home town. So she decied to get back in touch with a nature side and hold off taking her test intill the spring instead of rushing things.	1	1		1																					
3433	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to that she still has hope of finding home and being happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. So when the plant budds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy, that is when she will take the driving test. Also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting acustomed to the new home and lifestyle, �A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks deer and�yes�familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.� Through these examples I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show Saeng assimilation into her new lifestyle, and her acception of her situation.	3	2		3																					
3437	4	The author is letting us /reader know that the give plans to do the same thing again next year when the show is  all gone, when the geese come back and when etcs  warm enough for the hibiscus flower to bud/bloom again! the author @MONTH1 also be concluding the sentence to show that this is the life the little give chose and she will keep up with new gardening till the next spring!	0	0		0																					
3443	4	Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, �when they come back�, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the �hibiscus is budding� then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready.	3	3		3																					
3444	4	I believe that the Author ended the story with this paragraph, because I think it is showing that Saeng isn�t a quiter. Saeng can�t wait until the Hibiscus comes back. When the Hibiscus comes back she�ll retake the test and show her mother that she can do it.	1	1		1																					
3445	4	The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the �Madagascar periwinkle� growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.  	1	1		1																					
3447	4	They conclude the story with that because the winter is over and spring is here and it will be beautiful again	0	0		0																					
3448	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they com back, saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 then she will become more familiar. For example, the author says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become , through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her now.� That tells me that she feels that over same time , she will become more familiar with driving and then she will take the test again. Then she @MONTH1 pass it	1	1		1																					
3449	4	 The author of �Winter Hibiscus� decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to @LOCATION1 and has had a rough time fitting in. She misses everything about her old home, from her grandmother to the old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels that all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the winter and bloom in the spring and that is what Saeng realizes she must do. The last paragraph said �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Spring is the time for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers start to bloom, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes she wants a new beginning as well to be brought I the spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph ties the theme of new beginnings into the story. It shows @CAPS1 new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it. 	3	2		3																					
3450	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng really wants to pass the test. You knows this when it says �And in the warm moist shelter of the green house, saeng broke down and wept.� This passage shows that she didn�t want to fail. When Saeng got home she had the white bud in the pot and her mother seen that she was crying. Then her mother was going to put the plant in the ground, then saeng to the shovel and did it he self. Having her realize she can take it again	1	1		1																					
3453	4	The author concludes with this paragraph te emphasize the new beginning that saeng is looking for. She was so disappointed when she failed her driver�s test. &the hibiscus was the thing to make her happy. she needed a new beginning to start over in a new country &the flower, the flower the snow , the geese, & the test all symbolize new beginnings &challenges to overcome , the geese & snow represent a change in season, the budding hibiscus  represent new life,& the passing of the test represent a milestone in saeng�s life . Ending the story with this paragraph makes the reader expect something new & exciting to happen to saeng.	3	2		3																					
3454	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to explain to the reader that she isn�t done gardening, that she�ll  go back when it blooms once again. also she isn�t done. she�d rather garden than go to school. This is what the author concludes about the story with the last paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3455	4	The author concludes this story with the few words �then I will take that test again.� because she wanted us to know that she is not going to give up on something she failed once. She is going to keep going until she succeeds with passing �the test.�	1	1		1																					
3456	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, �It�s flowers aren�t pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. �It shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repition of season upon season�� It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that she�s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be strong and follow the flow of life.	2	1		2																					
3457	4	The author concluded this story for a internal adjust. Saeng's memories are expressed through the one at the hibiscus. The spring is a season where everything is fresh and new. As by spring, Saeng's hope would be restored and thriving, when the budding hibiscus, and the will have the ability to try at the test again with more strength and inspiration. 	2	2		2																					
3458	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. 	3	3		3																					
3459	4	The resoned the author concludes the story with this paragraph because I she fail the test and make your learned to apprecite nature a litter bitter.	1	1		1																					
3460	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring.	0	0		0																					
3462	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because its how each year will begin and end.	0	0		0																					
3469	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotion connection to the memories and flashbacks that the Hibiscus brings back to her. At one point in the story, she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back aware of memories. Later on in the story, she takes the plant to her mother. At first @PERSON1 is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughter�s actions and feelings. Saeng is upset that she didn�t pass her test and her mother understands that. I think the author ends the story this way because wants the reader to see that because the hibiscuses is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, she will have a reason and motivation to continue and reach her goal of passing.	2	2		2																					
3470	4	Since it is getting close to winter the geese are going south. The plants are losing there leaves. Saeng says that she will take the test again. It seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds it will give her hope and confidence. Especially the hibiscus because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother, when she first saw it and held the leaf it brought a tear to her eye. And when it comes back next year it will rejuvinate her.	2	2		2																					
3473	4	The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects.	1	2		2																					
3474	4	I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize�s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her.	2	1		2																					
3475	4	the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sounds like a interesiting ending paragraph that have something to do with the story	0	0		0																					
3476	4	I think the author concludes the story with that saying because it shows that she is adappting to the new place. It @CAPS1 shows that she isent going to give up. Just like the geese don�t give up flying back and forth ever winter and spring. 	1	1		1																					
3477	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� Saeng decides to retake failed driver�s test in the spring. She does so because she is comforted on the moderate weather of the spring. It reminds her of home, and Saeng is very closely attached to home. It reminds me of all the places I�ve been and how I still remember my favorite one. Like Saeng, I buy objects that remind me of my old home Saeng�s commitment to her old home makes me feel less different when I miss my old home.	1	1		1																					
3484	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line �.. Slowly fading into the distance.� Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line �� Through the quiet repition of season upon season.�. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it.	1	2		2																					
3485	4	The author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between flowers and the test. To finish with this shows she will try season after season just like geese come back every year. Since she tries to make a??? Shows she hasn�t given up she will keep trying year after year. Also, it says that this girl is determined and she won�t stop trying till she gets it right. Next, this last paragraph can tell you about the whole story. Lastly, I think it gives a feeling for the whole story.	2	2		2																					
3487	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes the story a happy ending how she doesn�t give up and is taking the test again. Also she doesn�t want to disappoint her mom she wants to make her happy and give the test a second chance.	1	1		1																					
3488	4	She ends it with that statement to show that she is ready to relive spring in the new country now that she is comforted by the hibiscus. The test is adapting to the new country and she failed it she believes because she had to be comforted by her native plants, but she believes that she will pass the test next year because every repetition of the season allow her to become  more adapted to the new culture. When she says ��when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.��All those things tell her it�s a new year and makes it easier to accept what�s happening.        	2	2		2																					
3489	4	She realized that things come and go but also change. That content times of the year the world around her changed. She had no control over it. She also had to deal with living in a new country. Living in anew country was hard for Saeng. She had to eat new foods, hear new sonds, and see thing that she never had seen before. Failing her drives test was hard for her. Not knowing the launge and what going on around her was tough of on her. the world around her wasnt something she was us to. She knew she had to change herself and work harder to get what she wanted.	2	2		2																					
3491	4	I think the author concludes this story like this because they was beautiful `@CAPS1 gave her good luck because the @NUM1 time around she didnt kno they was their	1	1		1																					
3492	4	"To me it seam like the whoever was saying that must of been going through a lot of things and that they was feeling like they were being tested or something or maybe somebody left her that she really loved because it say �when they come back"" so @CAPS1 thinking somebody @MONTH1 have left or something."" And the reason I said that the person @MONTH1 have feel as if they were being tested because it says �I will take the test again.�"	0	0		0																					
3493	4	The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomforalable. For example when she broke down in the flower shop. This shows that even though things can remind her of home it isn�t the same. You have to get used to and become accostumed to a new place. This also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test.	2	2		2																					
3494	4	The author uses this conclusion for a reason. The reason the author uses this cliff-hanges of a conclusion is to keep the reader interested and wanting more. By saying,�I will take that test again,� the author makes the reader question if Saeng will pass the test next time and the reader will wonder what �the test� is.	1	1		1																					
3496	4	There was a specific reason as to why the author concluded the story with that quote. The author wanted to show how the plant gave Saeng a new sense of determination. Saeng previously was upset and tearing the plant apart. But It seemed that she realized how the plant was able to bud to the odds and survive. So she now was determined to battle the odds as well and retake the test she failed.	1	2		2																					
3497	5	In this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @PERSON3's life, the mood containing it all, was greatful, and showed how his parents gave him love through his whole life.

In doing so they turned an apartment into a place of love and caring that he will never forget and more importantly passed this love onto him.

Finally, the author talks about his community, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" No matter what nationality they were the comunity was very close together and understanding. It was these basic principles of friendship, trust, love, and caring that were passed onto the author of this excerpt by a varity of people and give the excerpt a mood of love."	4	4		4																					
3509	5	The mood of the memoir is very upbeat, happy mood of how @PERSON1. Grew up in Newark, New Jersey in a very Cuban family and tells the story of how Narciso went through his childhood. This memoir really emphasizes the connection and love that Narciso had with his parents and his home. It kind of makes you think that there is more to a house than just walls and a ceiling and that maybe it's part of a family.	1	1		1																					
3512	5	 The mood created by the author in this memoir was very loving and caring for their friends, family and everyone around them, for example it says how his mom would always keep the door open for whoever was going through a rough time or untill they were back on their feet because she knew they would do the same for her and her family. Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life. The mood also shows how that somthing small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in.	2	2		2																					
3516	5	The mood set by the author in the memoir is a home is home kind of mood, like a great family, great friendships/relationships and open arms kind of feeling. He mentions the fact that his parents always helped friends and family in need and how selfless they were towards other people.

He gives the reader a sence of comfort and generosity and he thanks his family deeply for expressing spirit, generosity and selflessnes to people.	2	2		2																					
3523	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a serious, happy and thankful mood. The author was serious to the point where his family had to go through economic and personal problems. However, the author was happy how they lived in a friendly and unified neighborhood with other immigrant from different countrys. The author showed thankfulness because his parents worked so hard to give him a new life. The memoir showed a good mood as well as a accurate portrait of the athour childhood.	2	2		2																					
3527	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, the mood is a very important part of the story. The mood in this memoir is definiatley thankfulness. The first reason for why the mood of this story is thankfulness is because @PERSON1 is thankful for his Cuban heritage. @PERSON1 shows his love for his heritage by stating ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills"". @PERSON1 is very thankful that he has these skills from his great culture. The second reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his home. ""...Formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"", @PERSON1 writes in his memoir. This quote shows that @PERSON1 is thankful for a nice place to call his home. the final reason that the mood of this memoir is thankfulness is that the author is thankful for his hardworking parents.

Thankfulness is a mood that suits this memoir very well, and the pride and gratefulness that the author shows for his heritage, home, and parents is wonderful."	3	4		4																					
3529	5	The author could have put alot of different types of mood in the memoir. I think that the mood of the memoir is happy, greatful and appreciated. I said happy because he talks about every thing he does and how he enjoys it I said greate because he is always thanking his parents and he admires them. He admires them because thy have comed last to the good life and they do everything in their power to have a good life. An he appreciates him because of the same thing I said before he admires them and always thank them for what they have done to her. This is the mood the authors has toward writting the story.	2	2		2																					
3530	5	"In Narciso's memoir, I feel joy. I feel joy because Narciso's parents were able to survive. They came to @LOCATION1, ""without any knowledge of the language or culture."" @CAPS1 immigrant families do not get on there feet right away and they did, within a year they went from a @NUM1 room apartment to a @NUM2 room appartment.Joy came to my mind also because they had welcoming arms to there family. People today are losing there jobs & homes and they have nobody to go to, but the Rodriguez family had a place to go. ""Countless extaded family members came & went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms & their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."""	3	2		3																					
3532	5	"Author Narciso Rodriguez describes his love and happiness towards his family in this memoir. He states how his parents gaveup everything not for themselves for him and his relatives. The community they moved to was so happy and also like his family to him. Narciso describes how him and his family keep their @CAPS1 culture with them and he appresiates it. The last sentence truely says it all ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". All of that shows how during this memoir his mood is happy, loving, and grateful all at once."	3	2		3																					
3533	5	"The authors mood in the memoir @PERSON1 is thankful. I know this, because in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 talks about his culinary skills and how grateful he is to have it passed down to him. This shows us that he is very much thankful for this skill, because some people don't know how to cook and to be able to cook is a blessing. This also shows us that he is proud of his culture and who he is as a person. @PERSON2 quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" In @CAPS2, this shows us that @PERSON2 was very much appreciative of all that his parents had done for him. Also that he loved his parents dearly and every chance he gets, he thanks them. Therefore in the memoir Narciso gives off the mood of being thankful."	3	2		3																					
3534	5	The author's interpretation of their childhood home set a mood of love and compassion. He writes about his parents in a way that informs the reader that they were extremely good people. He describes them, as well as others in their community, as honest, hardworking, selfless people. He writes the story with much appreciation of his parents, family, and life, which is very admirable. He describes that he lived in a house with only three rooms, and yet his parents made a home out of it and welcomed others to stay, too. The mood that this author set was that of love and compassion, and he did a very good job of explaining what his childhood home meant to him.	2	2		2																					
3535	5	"In this memoir, there are moods created by the author in the memoir. One mood in the memoir was peaceful. In this excerpt it stated, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great soliderity and friendship."" This meant that everyone got along with no fighting unlike segregation dowin  the @CAPS1 at the time. Another mood is humble. A quote from the text says, ""I will always be greatful to my parent for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that no matter what @CAPS3 will @CAPS2 his parents. Lastly, the author created the mood modesty. To prove this @CAPS3 stated, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" @CAPS3 means that his parents (they) had Showed him everything @CAPS3 knows today. Therefore, this memoir has moods that are created by the author."	3	3		3

In a time when racism and segregation was normal in @LOCATION2, @PERSON2 and his family had many happy times in his home in Newark, New Jersey. His town was filled with Cuban, Spanish, and Italian immigrants. His neighborhood was united and hardworking. In his memoir, Rodriguez writes about his kind parents. In the memoir, it states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us,"" (p. @NUM1). Rodriguez's family was always willing to help others because they knew the favor would be returned. The Rodriguez family used their strong kindness to help everyone in the neighborhood. In return, they were respected. Also, Narciso Rodriguez writes about the bravery of his parents.  He writes, ""They came selflessly, as immigants do to give their children a better life...."" (p.@NUM1-13).  His parents wanted to help their children and give them better lives. They sacrificed their needs and wants for their children.

""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1, Narciso uses parentheses to give more background information.Narciso's memoir was a very heart felt story. It made me feel like even through hard times people can find the good in things. This story makes me think of my dad because when things go wrong he can always make a joke or find the bright side of the story."	3	3		3																					
3571	5	"the mood was definatly uplifting and happy. at first when he describes his ""house"" he says within these walls my young parents treated our traditional cuban ""home"". You see how he goes from house to home that then you know is a happy place for them. with their kitchen as the ""heart"" (happy heart) cuban music fills the air/ (which he adores). this is just a verry uplifting story how he was born into a cuban, Spanish, Italian people dealt with racism and his parents are welcoming in their extended big extended family  into sleep eat everything. this is a good family and like he said family is not about being blood related its about loving them the way they come and still be in their homes. their family is without a worry all about love and courage his parenths taught him something special and how you can have more than a blood related family. All you need is a little selfishness and alot of courage."	2	4		3																					
3573	5	I think the mood is happy. because Spanish cuban and Italian in the same neigh borhood with out fighting, and it seems like they like than life in United States.	1	1		1																					
3575	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important. Family is very important an example of that in paragraph @NUM1 is when the author @PERSON1 writes ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relatives.""The second way that shows family is important is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.The third and final example is in paragraph @NUM3 when the author writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 three examples show that family is the most important thing."	3	2		3																					
3576	5	"The mood of the author in this memoir was happy, grateful, and gratitude. I say happy because in the story the author said ""in our neighborhood despite customs else where, all of the cultures came together in a great solidarity and friendship. I say happy because the author was happy to enjoy having so many friends and family to come over everyday and have fun. another mood is grate full the author as it says in the story ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The author says this because the authors parents loved him a lot they went out every day trying to get money to make sure the author had a good life and the author was greatful for that. Now the author had gratitude for all the things the author's parents did ""parents created our traditional Cuban home"" also ""passed on to me the rich culonary skills and love for cooking"" and ""where I celebrated my first birthdays"". The author had gratitude for all these things and more because without the things his parents did he wouldn't be who he is today."	3	3		4																					
3578	5	In the memoir the expressed different moods. One of these moods were appreciative, he was appreciative that his parents made a house into a home. They made him happy by the way his parents passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking and their passionate cuban music which filled the air of his home. The author also expresses how he is grateful that his parents left their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved so that they could come to america, start their life over, have a better life for themselves and himself.	2	3		3																					
3579	5	The author in the story created a mood that you could feel all over while reading the article. The author created a feeling of homeliness and peace. He created this feeling because while reading he never uses a word about violence or hate. Also while reading he talks about how him and his family always helped each other out. He also considers his community family and that really makes you feel at peace inside.	2	1		2																					
3581	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created Is happy and loving. In the memoir it says, ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 of people were very close to his family and @CAPS2 found out you don't have to be blood relatives to be family. Also it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS2 is happy his parents moved to @LOCATION1 and is grateful of the sacrifices they had to make do do it. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. @CAPS2 went from Just living there to it being his home. @CAPS2 appieriates all his parents have done to make his life better."	3	3		3																					
3582	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is how she learned the definition of ""family"". She learned the definition of ""family"" at what she calls it her ""simple house"". I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, she says ""It was here where I learned the definition of ""family.' "	2	1		2																					
3583	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author creats a special mood. I think the mood is kind of both happy and sad at the same time. It is sad because the parents had to leave all of their family, friends, and careers back in Cuba, while coming to @LOCATION1 not Knowing the language. He didn't even get to meet his real grand parents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba. The mood is happy too because the parents did all of this for their child. He gets to live a happy life in their new home, with their new friends."	2	2		2																					
3585	5	"In this memoir gives a grateful feeling. Some of the reasons I think this is because like in paragraph @NUM1. The author says ""�our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuba, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevail in the United States."" But the main part of the story is that how he loves the neighborhood he lives in and the house he lives in and mostly how much the people are basically family in that neighborhood. And that is why I think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir."	2	2		2																					
3586	5	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood in the story is willing, greatful, and hopeful. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"" that quote represents that the family was willing to go through not having a good job like in cuba and segragtion to make a better life for their kids. ""My parents always kept there door open for the people we considered family"" this quote shows the family was was greatful to have a home and still let the people they loved live there with them. ""My mother and Father came to this country with such courage, with out knowlage of the language and culture. That quote showed that the family was hopeful enough that even without knowing about the country they still believed it would bring a better life. In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the family was willing to do anything for a better life."	3	3		3																					
3587	5	"The mood created by the author is showing even though they came From Cuba they can still make a living and become bilingual and translate and help others Find @CAPS1. For example, ""Often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to got back on their Feet."" meaning the would help some one until the got a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 a apartment that was good for them and for what the make a mounth if they had Jobs. Therefore, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people we considered family"" @CAPS4 each other if the had problems. Also the mood was good because they came got an apartment and at the end every ones happy because it became their Home."	1	2		2																					
3588	5	"I think that the author created a very warming, and the loving tone. Narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in @LOCATION1. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that ""... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."""	1	2		2																					
3589	5	What I think the mood of this story is really soft and explainable since it explains how these people immigrated from their country to where they live now just to basically get a better life. And they certainly did They are happy of ther home and the @CAPS1 is happy because of his amazing educational options. That is what I would say the mood of this story is.	1	1		1																					
3590	5	During Narciso's life, growing up in a small house doesn't matter when you're surrounded by people you love. The author created the mood of happiness, love, achievement, and being proud. Narciso was very proud of his cuban heratige, as well has his brave parents, that created a beautiful home and life for him. The mood was also happy because it's a very happy story. There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home and childhood. The achievement was of his parents comming over to @LOCATION1 and starting a better life. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is important.	2	3		3																					
3593	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created by the author. The mood is happiness and joyfulness because in this memoir the author continues to talk on about his family a culture which is a perfect reason for the mood to be happy. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" this quot was found in @CAPS1 @NUM1, this quot also shows that his family was kind and generous. This mood involved the familys culture which Narciso loved so much. His beautiful culture was just another piece of the puzzel that fit together, and that last quot ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home"" found in @CAPS1 @NUM2 really puts every thing together touching the reader emotionally."	2	2		2																					
3596	5	"The mood in the memoir is very adventorous. In the memoir it showed how Narciso's parent's and relatives moved. At first Narciso lived in a furnished one-room apartment, then they could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment that was soon to be Narciso's home. Narciso was born in 1961, in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Narciso grew up with his family for a while. ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Narciso will always be greatful and loving to his parents for what they did for him."	1	1		1																					
3597	5	In the author's memoir the author creats a mood and that mood in the story as happyness anjoy. It is happyness and @CAPS1 becuse he was happy for his home and how his parents were cooks. He also joyed the music and things he does with his family and relitize. I think this is the mood the author used in the memoir.	2	1		2																					
3598	5	Narciso Rodriguez, a memoir about growing up in a new environment with his family, Narciso puts a definite mood in the memoir. The mood, to put it in general terms, is happy. The author did not put any negative information in the memoir and only put a positive feeling. In paragraph two, the author explains how his parents brought their Cuban heritage into their home like food, music, family gatherings, and fun celebrations. All of that set a very happy backdrop for the family. In paragraph four, Narciso shows that there was always people over and having a fun time. Narciso's surrogate grandparents, babysitter, cousins, and aunts and uncles came and had a good time. Finally in paragraph six, the author sums it up and tells that he will always be grateful for his parents' love and sacrifice. His parents were thanked repeatedly by him for their strength and perseverance and taught him that friends and family are very important. Overall, this memoir had a very positive and happy mood.	3	3		3																					
3599	5	"Home and family is the @CAPS1 one thing all of us love. The mood the author created was heartwarming and appreciation, because he explains how comftable his home is with everyone, together having a good time. Not only Just being together but being together: ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in him a great sense that ""familly"" nothing to do with being a Blood relative.""Narciso Rodriguez show his appreciation for his parents he loved so much because they had to make an important change to give him a better life wiched he deseverd. They had made this change ""even though it meant leaving behind their families."" Such bravery they had.The author left us knowing his appreciation for his ""home"" with being grateful for his parents and his hispanic heritage."	2	2		2																					
3600	5	"The author created a mood in the memoir. The author creates the mood of friendliness. I know this because in the text it says ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solodalriy and friendship."" This means that even though there was segregation around them, their neighborhood was still friendly. All and all, the author created a mood in the memoir."	2	1		2																					
3601	5	"The mood created in this memoir is excilent. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This gives me the feeling of thankfulness and to really admire what my parents have done for me. Another example is in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""It was here I learned the real definition of family."" This quote makes me feel so happy that I have a family that supports me and is always there for me. This memoir really changed how I look at things and made me relize how thankful I am to have my family."	2	3		3																					
3602	5	"The way the author describes his family and his home gives the memoir a very warm, happy, and pleasant mood. He had a very warm tone when he talks about how much love there was in his house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, and the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The mood of the memoir was happy up lifting when he talked about how his parents helped others and they always had people in their house. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The mood of the memoir was brought to life when the author described the rich culture in his home. ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.... Unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" I think the addition in the parentheses make it light and airy. His tone is thrilled and thankful for his rich culture. The author's tone was very sweet, I think, when thanking his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me... and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.... and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" The mood of the memoir is warm, happy, and sweet, thanks to the author."	4	4		4																					
3603	5	The mood changed throughout the memoir. First the mood started off depressing by saying in Cuba they had a one room furnished apartment. That when they came to @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment. Next mood was inspirring. It was inspirring because the parents were a poor family and they found a way to move out of cuba. Also because his parents were selflessly getting out of cuba so there children could have a better place to live. Lastly there was a mood of family. They were honest hardworking immagrants who extended a hand to help people in need. Also they were always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogated grandparents Sergio and @CAPS1 there too. The mood changed throughout the whole memior from depressing to inspirring and to family which it always was about.	3	2		3																					
3604	5	Narciso was very proud of his cuban culture. He was very happy with who he had become, and how he had been raised. Narciso set a very proud and greatful tone to this memoir. He explains that family isnt about blood relations; its about people who love eachother, and are going to be there for eachother. He told us that his parents passed on the cuban culture to him, in cooking. He also explained how his parents built the home on their own, that he got to grow up in. Narciso says how proud he is to be a cuban, and how his family works @CAPS1 hard to earn a living. Narciso told us how proud and happy he was, to be in a nice home, with friends, family, and a future. He told us he learned to love.	3	3		3																					
3610	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author uses words such as warm to describe things. ""Warm homes"" gives you a happy feeling @CAPS1 two gives you a happy mood overal. It makes you think about how happy the author is knowing they still have their family memories/skills.In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author using many words which set the mood of happiness, like ""warmth of kitchen, humble home, not just scent and music but life and love, gracious neighborhood, and simple house into a home. These choice words used by the author give you a good feeling and put you in a happy mood."	2	2		2																					
3614	5	In the memoir, the author creates a mood. The feeling, or mood, that I think that the author is trying to create is a very grateful mood. I say this because that author is talking about how he is grateful, or thankful, to his parents for teaching him things and for bringing him up in a home and neighborhood that was very united and close.	2	1		2																					
3615	5	"The author created a sense of love and care in Narciso Rodriguez. The author talked about the sense of family and how people don't have to all be the same to become one community. In @CAPS2 @NUM1 it explains ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immagrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" @CAPS1 shared the feeling of acceptance because although they were all from different cultures and ethnicities, they all learned how to become one ""family"" in a rascist enviroment. @CAPS1 shared how his parents made the difficult decision to move to the new place leaving loved ones behind for their children's better future (@CAPS2 @NUM2). @CAPS1 showed a lot of admiration for his parents based on what they do for him and how they always have other family members or neighbors around the kitchen table for meals. In @CAPS2 @NUM3 @CAPS1 says ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and impressed upon me and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The author shares his feelings of love toward his parents in this memoir."	3	4		4																					
3619	5	In the memoir the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood of faith throughout the reading. As the author describes the parents moving into the United States, it tells how they had to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. The motivation to do so reveals the parents faith in creating a home just as good as before. The author is very grateful as he admires his parents faith that has traveled so far over time. Rodr�guez believes his parents have more courage then anyone and have expressed so much generosity upon him and others to always have their arms open to help others. It was the parents faith at the struggles would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times.	2	3		3																					
3621	5	"Reading this article expresses many different mood changing from the auther. While reading you can notice he's proud of his Cuban culter explaining how united his family has always been for as long as he can remember. Most important his so greatful to his parents for everything they've been through to see him sucuss in life and that's what I admire the most from the author. This story is giving thanks to his parents and his culture. He mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story. Like at the end when he says ""I learned the definition of ""family"", meaning his family was there for each other and and love was all over. This pasage made me realize everything my mother went through to see my brother and I success, so I can say I can relate to the auther."	3	2		3

3624	5	"The mood that the author of this memoir is one of love and togetherness. The way that he describes his parents hard work and love is incredible. First, it says in @CAPS2 @NUM1 ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find."" This demonstrates love beond comperashin seening as they had to start over from scratch steping down far benith there potential to care for their children. They never gave up but instead kept going to try and give there children a better life than they would have had. Also this memoir expresses togetherness not only in the famley but in the community as a whole. As it says in @CAPS2 @NUM2 ""� Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and italian immigrants�"" @CAPS1 even though they were of all kinds of races ""It was a close � knit community of honest hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who while not necessary their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS2 @NUM2) This was a community who cared for each other and helped out anybody in need of help despite raise. His parrents also kept their doors open and alowed people to just come in and stay until they were able to get back up onto their feet. Knowing that they would do the same for them. This takes a community that is very close to be able to do something like this. These are but a few of the different examples throghout this memoir that illistrate the mood that the author creates of love and togetherness."	4	4		4																					
3626	5	This memoir had one theme that meant many different things. One theme was helpful. The family moved to the @LOCATION1 from Cuba in 1956 and had many hard ships and struggles. Because they know what it feels like they decisded to help the other struggling people, and let them stay with them; that's exactly what they did. Another theme that I thought fit was inspiration. I think this family not only inspiried their children but other neighbors and other reletives. Last, I think another theme of this excerpt was heart � felt. The @CAPS1 � @CAPS2 family risked everything to help other families. That's was a very nice action they took on them. One person can slowly make a difference, person by person; that is exactly what this family did.	1	3		2

It made it peaceful because the author gives the reader the feeling that their was nothing to worry about. The author never mentioned any negative activity in the memoir. He just explained how he was very thankful for how his parents raised him and the lessons that his parents taught him. He mentioned how thankful he was for his parents since they were willing to sacrafice things in their lives for the benefit of their children. The author made the reader feel like Narciso was protected in the house he lived in because all his neighbors were so united with each other that they were all friendly to each other so there was nothing to worry about. They all cared for each other so they would protect each other if anythin bad were to happen which gives the memoir a peaceful and worryless mood. The author talks about how his house was simple, warm, humble, and full of his memories which is another reason I think the memoir had a peaceful mood. When you read the memoir, you can see how the author only talked about good things and a worryless life which really gives the memoir a peaceful mood. These are some reasons that show how this memoir has a peaceful mood given by the author who wrote it.	4	3		4																					
3657	5	"The mood created by the memoir is very explicit. He shows that he loves where he is and he doesn't want to trade it for anything. He loves his neighborhood because for him it's like a ""melting pot"". There are @CAPS1, cubans and Spanish people living there. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains how his parents house and doors are open to anyone who needs help getting back on their feet. The author also gives a sad mood at the memoir. In paragraph @NUM2, his parents lived in a one-room apartment hoping that one day, they can afford to live in a three-room apartment. That is the mood the author gives off in the memoir."	1	2		2																					
3658	5	"In the memoir the author has various moods. In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS1, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family... my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" The mood here is nuetral but kind of happy because the author is talking about her house. In paragraph @NUM2 it @CAPS1, ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This mood is @CAPS2 because the author is talking about the parents hardships. Also, in paragraph @NUM3, it @CAPS1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also shows that the mood is happy because the author is grateful. These are the various moods that the author had in the memoir."	3	2		3																					
3659	5	"The author creates a proud mood in the memoir. The author gives information about his background and how his parents were proud of it. Paragraph two states ""I was born into this simple house...my young parents created our traditional Cuban home...the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Narciso's parents tired to influence as much as their Cuban heritage as they could. Narciso parents were always kind and loving to others. Paragraph four states ""My parents always kept their arms open and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Though his parents didn't seem to have much money, they still housed others until they got back on their feet. Narciso parents worked hard knowing that they wouldn't get what they deserved. Paragraph five states ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" His parents worked hard for what they worked for and no one can take that away. In conclusion, the author makes the reader feel praud for what Narciso's parents have done."	3	3		3																					
3662	5	I think the author's mood was kind of like @CAPS1. I said that because as he was going along in the memoir at the end this statement is that his mom and dad turn a simple house into a home. That statement tells me that the author feels @CAPS1 well he is inside his home or inside a home with his family members. I Also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from.	2	2		2																					
3664	5	"The mood is happy, proud, and grateful. Happy because he loved his family, his culture, and his home. ""In our neighborhood, dispite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso was proud and grateful to his parents because they gave up everything to come to the United States to give their family a better life. Without knowing alot about this new country, they struggled to overcome problems. Narciso is grateful to his parents for living their life to start over. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."""	2	2		2																					
3665	5	In this memoir the authors mood is satisfied, and greatfull. Hes greatfull because his parents came down from cuba with their new born to start a new life and the baby can learn a lot, even though they had to leave behind  their friends and family.	1	1		1																					
3667	5	"In the memoir, Home: Blueprints of our Lives, by Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS3 sets a mood of warm, loving, and fun. @CAPS2-out of the whole memoir, Narciso talks about how his family moved into a home in Newark, New Jersey, and... ""within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen,"" @CAPS1 you picture that in your mind you create a very warm, tasty, good-smelling room, which helps create a mood for the whole memoir. Another way Narciso creates mood is when @CAPS3 talks about the cuban music flowing @CAPS2 the house, ""Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" With this @CAPS3 shows that it was fun, warm, inviting, and exciting. @CAPS3 says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family, and friends, and endless celebrations that encommpassed, both, formed a backdrop, to life in our warm home."" @CAPS3 also creates a mood of fun, warm, entertaining, and loving feeling, by describing parties, celebrations, with friends and family, In This memoir, the author sets a mood of warm, loving, fun, and entertaining."	4	3		4																					
3668	5	The mood that the author created was happy. All the people in the story were happy and some what sad.	0	1		1																					
3669	5	"The mood created by the authar was warmthness. He was so @CAPS1 toward his family moving @CAPS2, he also cared for his parents alot and what they had done for their family. I know this because ""I will never forget how my parents turn to the simple house into a home""."	3	2		3																					
3670	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives mood created is described. The starting evidence found in the memior is. ""my parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" The mood being created is detirmenation. The parents were determined to make it to the United States because that was hard to do. But the parents did make it to the United States. The other piece of evidence found is ""in 1961, I was born into the simple house, situated in a two-family, blonde-brick building in the @CAPS1 bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" The mood being created is happiness and sadness. There is happiness because he was just born. The sadness is that they couldn't go to the hospital and they live in a two-family house. This is the moods created in the memior."	2	2		2																					
3671	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was like hapeness and he had a lot of emotion. Because he really loves his mother, and father and his baby sister. There is lots of emotion because Narciso talks about how he lives were he lives and how long he lived in a one-room apartment. The hapeness part is When he says I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home that was realy a happy and sad memory.	1	2		2																					
3673	5	"The mood in this memoir was soft, with an exception. I say that the mood is soft because it has a nice thankful mood that's really telling everyone how grateful he is of his parents and their care. It's also saying that there was racism and segragation, so in that paragraph (which is the exception) the mood is more of a rougher mood, I say rougher as in ""a rough life,"" having to deal with racism and segragation. Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend and her putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly, this reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the camunity helps out by sometines cooking neals. This was nice of Alegria (@ORGANIZATION1's friend). And also, how they would house family until they were back on their feet and having the feeling that their familly would do the same. for them. And lastly, the last sentence of the last paragraph gave the sense of them took a house and turned it into a home would be comforting. These all gives off the soft sense, meaning nice and thankful"	3	2		3																					
3677	5	In this memoir of the author creates a clear mood. He keeps stating over and over that he is so grateful of his parents and family members. Also, he describes that his house was always filled with amazing smells and cuban music. It also says that there was always a feeling of love and happiness in the air which sometimes pushed them through the hard times that they faced. Another thing that he says is that even though almost everyone has a different race, everyone got along and help others out. And one final way I know he had a happy mood, is that he said everyone was honest and hard working.	2	3		3																					
3678	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were. In the last sentence of the memoir it reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows the reader that no house is a home without happy memories and great lessons learned."	3	2		3																					
3681	5	"The moods created by the author in the memoir is happiness, love, and gratitude To start, it made me feel happy because of  the way he described his house, and how delightful it was. ""cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This quote made me visualize the scene, and I felt happy to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting. Secondly, it made me feel loving to my loved ones like my family and friends. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,..."" I love my family, and would be thankful if they tried to take their home country to the United States (if they were born somewhere else) with them. Finally it makes me feel grateful to my own family, and friends. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I would be grateful also. That is how this memoir makes me feel once I read it."	3	3		3																					
3684	5	"The mood created by the author is a feeling of greatfulness for his parents.Narciso Rodriguez is grateful to his parents for coming to the United States with courage. @CAPS2 realizes that they came to this country to give their children better lives. His parents had no knowledge of the @CAPS1 language. Rodriguez's parents had good jobs in Cuba, and had to start their lives from scratch, all for Narciso. Rodriguez has ""often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" @CAPS2 is grateful to his parents for turning his small house into a home in which family is valued more than materialistic things The first sentence of paragraph six, Rodriguez states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That is an extremely good indicator that the mood created by the author is a sense of greatfulness for his parents."	4	4		3																					
3685	5	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates a very warm peaceful and interesting mood. The way the author described the way she used to live looks like she lived a very loving and peaceful enviroment. She also creates a spanish theme to it which I could relate to. For example in paragraph @NUM1 she says she is very passionate for Cuban music and she's grateful she know how to cook. She also said in paragraph @NUM2 she will never forget how her parents turned a simple house into a home. That quote makes the mood of the memoir loving."	2	2		2																					
3687	5	The author created a calm mood. Everything he talks about is in the same tone. When he talks about the kitchen in his home, he also created a happy mood. He was calm while talking about the memories in his old home. He stayed calm when he talked about how caring his parents were. Overall, the whole writing is in a calm mood.	1	1		1																					
3688	5	"The @CAPS1 created by the author in this story is a couple different types of moods. One of those moods is a happy and good @CAPS1. One example of this is when the author states ""I Learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That shows a good @CAPS1 because it is about loving. Next example of a happy or good @CAPS1 is when the story states ""Countless extended family members came and whent-and there was often someone staying with us temperally until they were able to get back on there feet."" This shows a happy @CAPS1 because they are welcoming people into there family. Another @CAPS1 in the story is sad. One example is when it says ""Could not afford to move into a moddest three room appartment"" This is a sad @CAPS1 because a you always want the best of for people and if there to poor to afford a good place and that is sad. Also it says ""They struggled both personally and financially. This is a sad @CAPS1 because they are haveing trouble getting by. There is more then @NUM1 @CAPS1 in this story, but the most import @CAPS1 I think is loving. A example of loving is when it states ""all thes cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That line right there is showing love. That is the most importand @CAPS1 to know in this story, loving."	4	4		4																					
3689	5	The mood created by the author was that how in the beggining it was a medium normal tune because he was Just describing who he was and where he lived and what his life was like. Then towards the medium and end in changed alot in my perspective. That it changed to a sad tone because not That his life was hard also how gratful he was. And how his Parents seemed like great people. for everything they did with him. That I got This answer by the beggining and ending of the story of how sad his life was but he seemed to make the best of things and said he had a good time and or everything he did. Thats my opinion and answer to the story.	1	2		2																					
3690	5	"The mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The author creates gratefulness by repeatedly saying what his parents gave him and that he is grateful for it. First he talks about how he is grateful his parents got him interested in cooking. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their... love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author is grateful for his parents showing him to love cooking. Another time the author is grateful is in paragraph @NUM2. It says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the author is grateful for his parents' endurance to come to @LOCATION1. In conclusion, the mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. He was grateful for his parents giving him all they could."	3	2		3																					
3692	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy. It made me feel happy because it was good to know that ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This meant that all the people around you that care about you are your ""family"". Another reason why the mood of the memoir is happy is because I think if my parents were in the same situation that Narciso's parents were in, my parents would have done the same thing. My parents would have also wanted, ""to give their children a better life."" @CAPS1 this memoir makes me feel happy because of how caring Narciso's parent's were."	2	2		2																					
3693	5	The mood of the memoir is happy. I know this because the Rodriguez family crossed the border from Cuba to the United States to have a better life. They came in 1956, but had to wait until 1970 to be reunited with their Aunts and @CAPS1. They now have a bigger house. They are grateful they live in the United States.	1	1		1																					
3697	5	@PERSON1 is a short story about a boy who is very grateful & shows a lot of appriciation torwards his parents. He feels that he is at home even though he moved to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 it said his parents created his new home to look like a cuban home he had back in cuba by putting cuban thing on the wall. I feel that in this short story he is very grateful because he said in paragraph @NUM2 he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house to a home. @PERSON1 is a very calm and happy short story.	2	2		2																					
3698	5	"In the excerpt of Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives a memoir by @PERSON1 and internationally recognized clothing designer, there is a distinct mood of fond recollection of a warm and loving environment, as well as a greatfulness for the lessons learned in this environment. Narciso mentions how his parents created a home for him even though it meant making many, many sacrifices. He describes his @NUM1 � room apartment as a ""traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This quote is important because it begins the explanation of why his house gives him so many warm memories conveyed in his writing. Narciso explains how many people in his neighbor hood are immigrants that come together, help one another, and form one big family.  ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" Many people in his neighborhood joined Narciso's family for meals and this brought many of them closer. At the end of the memoir, Narciso explains how greatful he is that his parents gave up their lives in Cuba to give him a better chance in @LOCATION1 despite their hardships. This undeniable thankfulness is a large part of this memoir. "	4	3		4																					
3699	5	Narciso Rodriguez loves his family and home very much. In his memoir, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made and how truly grateful he is that his parents moved to New Jersey for a better life for themselves and him, no matter what the cost. His memoir is all about the love for his parents and his gratitude toward them. He really wants people to be able to feel to happiness that he feels when he thinks about his home and his wonderful life that his parents provided for him. He realizes his luck and therefore his memoir is very upbeat and shows that even in hard times, you can live life to its full extent.	2	2		2																					
3700	5	"In this memoir, there is more than one mood. There is love, friendship, and happiness Narciso expresses love for her parents and friends in paragraph @NUM1. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author is saying that everyone comes toge-ther and that they all care for eachother. She expresses friendship in parag-raph @NUM2. When she says that her babysitter was her first friend. Finally, she expresses happiness. In paragraph @NUM3, when she is saying ""she will never forget how her parents turned this simple house into a home. You could tell that she is happy, and grateful for her parents. Those are a @CAPS1 moods in the memoir."	2	3		3																					
3702	5	the @CAPS1 that the author created in the memoir was an uplifting one. His memoir talked about growing up in the gattr of Newark, New Jersey (which became more of a ghetto), during the time of immigration. His neighborhood was full of Spanish, @PERSON1, and Italian immigrants. His family would come over and they would have dinner together, and they would have people stay in their house until they got back on their feet. He had a childhood full of family and friendship. which is great to have.	1	1		1																					
3703	5	"The mood of the excerpt is very bright. The author describes her risk taking, loving parents. The author describes the many things her parents have given to her. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home...

Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.""     As you can see, the author. Narciso Rodriguez, describes her young life and home with happiness and greatfullness. This is all generously spoken within the depths of the excerpt. Many authors enjoy using these tones to express their own personal feelings and opinions about the matter. In this case, the author wanted to express joy in her writing."	3	2		3																					
3706	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is intresting. First of all, his parents ""originally from cuba but arrived in the united states in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one room apartment, twenty one years old Rawedia Maria and twenty seven year old @ORGANIZATION1 could afford to move into a modest three room apartment I would soon call home. ""in 1961, I was born into this simple house situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Thats how the mood is intresting from the author creation"	1	0		1																					
3707	5	"The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. The reason I say that is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents that left everything behind so that he could have a better life. He also sounded grateful when he talked about the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist to each other. He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of ""family"" while living in that house. By ""family"" he didn't mean blood relative Family. What he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too. The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful."	3	3		3																					
3709	5	"The author created a joyful mood. The author said, ""growing up in this environment istilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" he talks about how people are close and they dont have to be related to be conciderd family. The authour says ""my mother and father had came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the coltur."" The author is proud of his parents for doing that, that takes alo of courage."	1	2		2																					
3710	5	The mood created by the @CAPS1 is happy because he talking about starting a new life and how grateful family he has. The way he is also happy is that he has his 'family such as cousin, aunts, uncles, and grandparents by his side. Where he live is also happy he loves it he has his friends and babysitter living above him knowing that they are their for him. That why I think the mood is happy by telling by the story and @CAPS2 words.	1	1		1																					
3711	5	"In the memoir the auther created the mood that Narciso Rodriguez was proud of his cuban culture and heritage and that family was very important to him because in paragraph @NUM1 ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" so acsepted people as family."	1	1		1																					
3712	5	"The moods created by the author in the @CAPS2 were grate ful because of all the things that the parents did for their child. Friendly because they have ""family"" in the United states, and they Kept their arms, and door open for their ""family"". Also they had Courage because they didn't give, trying to learn the language, and finding a job. The last @CAPS1 that this @CAPS2 had was from paragraph seven, happiness, the chid has many memories of his/her Cuban heritage, Still listens to Cuban music, and was born and raised in the united states."	2	3		3																					
3713	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author is happy. The author describes his home is a place for family. He is grateful to his parents for everything they did. The author enjoyed his childhood. He was surrounded by loving people and lots of friends. That is how in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author is happy."	1	1		1																					
3714	5	"The mood of the author is a very gental yet very happy tone. The reason it's gental is because he's describing how he grew up and what his life was like. To some people, they could just blab all day, but to most they have to dig through memories so that they can get the sceen just right. For example, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.""     @CAPS1 the parts were the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" The reason that he could remember this more clearly is because he probably cooks for his family using his parents resipies."	2	3		3																					
3715	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is deffinitty being proud. The reason I think the author is proud is because he explains how he grew up throughout his whole life. Also, growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot, to being a famous fashion designer. Lastly, this memior's mood also seems proud because he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1, the author makes him seem proud of himself."	2	1		2																					
3717	5	"In ""@PERSON1"" the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion. Throughout the passage the author uses very passionate words such as ""aromas,"" ""endless,"" ""encompassed,"" ""instilled,"" etc. This shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir. He probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way. As a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. Another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Phrases like ""(and for which I am eternaly grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice."" The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude. As a result the mood of ""@PERSON1"" is one of passion and gratitude that is shown through the authors choice of words and statements. That is why I would describe the mood of ""@PERSON1"" as being very passionite and full of gratitude."	2	4		2																					
3718	5	The memoir's mood is a sense of happiness because its talking about a place where neighbors are like family and everyone is very close. Like how Sergio and @PERSON1 became his surrogate grandparents, when they were people who lived in the basement appartment. Alegria, his first friend normally ate dinner with them. The whole memoir is about how his parents showed him the meaning of family and to be open to friends and neighbors.	2	2		2																					
3719	5	"The overall mood created by the author of this memoir is one of complete gratefulness. The author is very, extremely thankful for his parents sacrifice, love, care and selflessness. He also creates a mood of happiness, unity and overall loving, that he has seen throughout his lifetime. The author describes his gratefulness towards his parents by remembering how they had to leave cuba, their native country, friends, family and jobs behind because they wished to give the child they wished for better life opportunities that could only be found in @LOCATION1. He thanks his parents repeatedly throughout the memoir for the love, caring, family, friends and selflessness they brought into his life. He describes situations where his parents had to make new friends and family from around their neighborhood and that from that a sense of love and friendship and unity was found. As his family got larger, the author talks about how his childhood, small, three-room apartment was made into a completed home. When all of these details combined, along with language such as. ""I've thanked them repeatedly,"" a mood and feeling of utter gratefulness is felt throughout the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez""."	3	4		4																					
3721	5	"The mood created by the author was a very grateful and happy mood in his memoir. For an example in paragraph six he states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their Love and sacrifice."" This shows how grateful he is to his parents. He is also grateful to his friends and neighbors it states this in paragraph three when the author says ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that Narciso Rodriguez is very neighborey and that his neighbors portray the same happy, grateful, and neighborely outlook. so all of these reasons explain the mood of Narciso Rodriguez."	2	2		2																					
3724	5	"The mood created by the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very uplifting and happy. One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how greatful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying that family doesn't allways mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you. Lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference."	2	3		3																					
3729	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy. The reason I say that because if my parents did that I should be very grateful because they did all this for me to be happy and for me to have a better life. ""And for which I am eternally grateful"". ""They Came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life"". Wow that @CAPS1 alot from his/her parents they are very strong and they did all for their children to be happy. This is the reason why I picked those two mood in the memoir!"	2	2		2																					
3731	5	"The mood created in this memoir is very homebound. How the parents turned the ""simple house"" into the ""traditional Cuban home"" was shocking. The parents played the ""Passionate Cuban music."" and ""a love of cooking"" helped create a family mood, and it showed how much they love their heritage. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relitave. This family loved spending time w/ eachother, and celebrating. Over all, the mood is loving, happy, and caring."	2	2		2																					
3735	5	The mood created in the memoir is the feeling of Cuban culture and the @CAPS1's home. The feeling could be described as homey. In paragraph @NUM1, this is where the @CAPS1 first introduces the custom of his house. And how it is. The @CAPS1 describes his house as simple with cuban music and the scent of cuban food flowing through it. The feeling that the @CAPS1 uses to describe his house is the feeling that the whole memoir had. The house kinda flooded the memior with it's feelings. Also this memior didn't only show cuban feeling it also gave of family vibes (like how a family is happy and together) It expressed how the @CAPS1 was close to his family	1	2		2																					
3737	5	The author was @CAPS2 likely describing his happy @CAPS1. Because in the memair it was talking about how he loved his home and his parents Cooking and music. He was @CAPS2 grateful for his parents caring and selflessness. He liked how his home was a community for Spanish, cuban, and italian immagrants. He thought back to his memorable birthdays and feasts and it made him happy. This is my summary of Narciso Rodriguez's mood of the story.	2	2		2																					
3738	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. Narciso projects a very greatful, thankful + optimistic mood. Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life. In paragraph six, Narciso says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it shows that Narciso is very greatful towards his parents, for bringing him to @LOCATION1, and him being who he is today, + who he was. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, than it wouldve or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optomistic man."	3	3		3																					
3740	5	"The mood described by the author in the memoir is a greatful and happy feeling I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, Always brings up how he is greatful for his partents helping him in his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story states, ""At tine when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great soidarity and friendship."" Even though there is racism, @CAPS1 one is friends."	2	2		2																					
3743	5	The mood the auther has is good. He's very proud of how he lives. The most thing that matters in his life are family. His family cares alot and watch over him no matter what and he is very thankful for all.	1	2		2																					
3749	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a truely original mood in the excerpt. I would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. He is consteintly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. One example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says: ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done."" This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful."	3	2		3																					
3751	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates a variety of different moods @CAPS2 the memoir. In paragraph two the author tells how much culture was put into his home ""my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" @CAPS1 also tells how thankful @CAPS1 is that his parents instilled him a love of cooking and Cuban music. This gives you a feeling of the home being warm comfortable and most of all alive. In paragraph three the athor tells how  a family has nothing to do with blood relatives. ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS2 out the memoir you really start to see the authors opinion of the definition of home and family. In paragraph six you see how grateful the author is towards his parents, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" It gives a mood of greatfulnes. In paragraph three and four the author talks about the sense of unity and how his parents would always have their door open to people in need and how the whole community was like a family ""cultures came together a great solidarity and friendship."" ""My parents always kept their arms and door open to many people we considered family..."" The general mood of this is all the moods coming together to creat a generas senseof home and community."	4	4		4																					
3752	5	"People make sacrafices for the ones they love. That is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless. They left their family and friends to give their son a better life. The author makes an enjoyable and heartwarming mood.Narciso is very greatful. He said he has ""learned the definition of 'family' "". His parents wanted a better life for him. They gave up a lot and he recognize that. Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned to very important lessons. Put others before yourself, and work hard."	3	3		3																					
3753	5	The @CAPS1 the author created is sentimental, sad but happy at the same time. I think the @CAPS1 is mostly sentimental because the family moves to @LOCATION1 and kind of looks back to good memories that happend in cuba.	0	1		1																					
3757	5	The mood in the memoir is calm and thankful. The calmness is because there are no conflicts. The thankful part is he keeps thanking his parents For making the sacrifice. How they did it for the next generations. The mood in this memoir calm and thank ful	1	1		1																					
3758	5	Before reading about @PERSON1 I don't think I read about anyone who is more happy than @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is very happy about being an @CAPS1 citizen and still be very happy of having another country's background (in this case Cuba). @PERSON1 was blessed that he had his house. It was in a great neighborhood and the kitchen was the main place of the house. @PERSON1 was very proud of where he lived even though his house was not a mansion or even close to a big house. @PERSON1 was very happy about his parents, most of all. Without his parents he would have lived in Cuba and would not have known his great neighborhood and all of his family and friends.	2	2		2																					
3759	5	The mood created by the author is how much the author missis his or her home and were she or he was born and riesed.I think the outhor misses that pleace more then every and that she or he wantes that @CAPS1 back. that the auther well never forget what happened and what the auther did and @CAPS1 in that house.	1	0		1																					
3760	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he thinks the definition of ""family"" is. He is very specific in that he believes ""family"" doesn't mean blood relatives, ""family"" is about friends and family coming together to form a community. Where everyone helps everyone and everyone is treated fairly and with respect. He sets a very specific mood in this memoir which is everyone coming together. That sense of happiness and fullness one might get after doing something good for someone else. Narciso Rodriguez talks about how his dinner table is alway full of family and sometimes friends. That his family's door is always open to people who need help. When you read his memoir, you really understand what ""family"" really is. The feeling of love, open-ness, willingness, and happiness. you get helping other people and being around people you love and who love you. The mood Narciso Rodriguez sets in this memoir is very powerful in that it really makes people stop and think."	3	4		4																					
3762	5	There is o good moud @CAPS1 to this @CAPS2. the mood is a warm, happy feeling. Whenyou read the @CAPS2 it makes you feel @CAPS4. Just like being at your own home. But only a little different. This time youare reading a @CAPS2. It really explains what is going On. It als o give s alot of past information. Which I like in a @CAPS2. But @PERSON1 seemed to really enjoy being cuban. @CAPS7 @CAPS5 to really like her Cuban food. Her family was good @CAPS6. The @LOCATION1 was a bad place when @CAPS7 was growing up asa child. The reason for this is because of racism and segregation. But other wise @CAPS7 has a good life.	1	1		1																					
3763	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. I think the mood is love because he talks about the love and support his whole family had. One example is when he says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To me that is saying how his parents loved him so much (even though he was not born yet) that they sacrificed everything they had for their children. That is why I think the mood is love."	2	2		2																					
3765	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, he feels a great amount of passion and love. He goes into detail about his culture, and says how much it means to him. He also feels love, love for his family and friend who were always there for him. He says That family goes further than blood.	1	1		1																					
3766	5	The mood of the story is some what sad and some what happy. It's sad because he comes from a not welthy family and were immergrants. but happy because he finaly knows the meaning of family and these are the moods of the story.	1	1		1																					
3769	5	"In this memoir, the author creates a very calming and relaxing mood. The author talked about how family isn't about blood, and how a house doesn't have to be spectacular to be a home. The authors said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors, created a great place to live. The mood also very hopefull. This is because the author's parents came to america with nothing, but with all their hard work, they over came their struggles and helped everyone else in their neighborhood. Another mood the story had was a loving mood, because even though his neighbors weren't his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were."	3	3		3																					
3771	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very soft and compassionate. The reason I would describe the mood as soft and compassionate is. When Narciso Rodriguez describes growing up with his parents and in cuba he never mentioned anything about what he hated about his family and about living in cuba. yet he describes all of what he loved about growing up as a child for example he says ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This shows that just because your  not related by blood does'nt mean your not family. Another reason why I would describe the mood of the authour as soft in compassionate is at the end of the memoir Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""In conclusion those are the ways why I would describe the mood created by the author as soft and compassionate. "	4	3		4																					
3777	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was grateful because Narciso is glad to be in @LOCATION1 with his family. In paragraph @NUM1 lines @NUM2-. ""I will always be greatful to my parents for thier love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more a courageous thing then I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. This is why the mood created by the author in the memoir was greatful."	1	2		2																					
3778	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. Here are some points to consider. First of the mood of the author is I think greatfulness. For example ""(and for which I am each currently grateful). ... (Which I adore to this day). second of all the mood of the author is appreciation. For example ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 I think another mood of the author is definitely love. I kno this because he talks about love and his family and friends alot. For example ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. In conclusion the authors moods can be described in many different ways."	2	3		3																					
3780	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the author created a happy tone throughout the whole story. Narcisco talked about how when he moved to @LOCATION1 he moved into a three-bedroom apartment. He brought with him the love of cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love for cooking that is still with me today. Narciso was very grateful that his parents came to @LOCATION1 to help him make his home seem more like a traditional Cuban home. ""It was a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"", and for that I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""	4	3		4																					
3781	5	The mood of the story is like a sad story then it leads to a happy ending. It starts sad because the family moves from cuba to the @ORGANIZATION1. They tell on nothing about the language or the traditions. It gets happier when they moved into the apartment and they find a job to work at. Thats what the mood of the story is.	1	1		1																					
3782	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very sad, loving, caring. @CAPS2 @NUM1 states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice; I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could of ever done."" @CAPS1 he is very respectful to his parents, thanks them for making a great life for him. Also in @CAPS2 @NUM1 states ""They showned me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" @CAPS1 whatever occurs you always go back to your roots. And how important family, and friends are. The real @CAPS1 of ""family"" through this kids eyes."	4	4		4																					
3784	5	"In this excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a sad story. The mood the author is putting sad and happy stories at the same time. One example is when his parents left from Cuba for his son's own sake for a better place. His parents had great jobs in Cuba. His mother was a Chemical @ORGANIZATION1. and his father worked in a labratory. ""In Cuba @PERSON2,had worked in a laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering."" The author's mood of this story is sad."	2	1		2																					
3786	5	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there are two contradicting moods. From chapters one to six Narciso said ""that all cultures came together in solidarity and friendship"" in his neighborhood. Rodriguez describes in-depth as well. He mentioned Cuban cooking and music, not a single detail was left out. There was so much happiness and bliss at the beginning, but it's soon faded as Narciso spoke of his parents. Narciso's parents, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, both sacrificed their lives to live in @LOCATION1. ""In @ORGANIZATION1 and Maria worked first class careers, but it was the exact opposite in @LOCATION1."" They would take any job they could find. This mood quickly fades away as Rodriguez describes his gratefulness to his parents. Narciso is very lucky to have parents like @PERSON2 and Maria to watch over him."	3	2		3																					
3787	5	"According to the memoroir the mood created by the author is he is thankful for everything his parents have gave him. For example, he states in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""Narciso always told his parents how greatful his is for them. But Narciso says ""But in reality there is no way to express my gratitude."""	2	2		2																					
3788	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It is showing all kinds of memories the family has at one house As it says in the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. It's saying that a house is a house and it doesn't mean much to people and anyone can go there. But a home is where you live, is where you grow up and have all the memories, it's just a better place"	2	2		2																					
3789	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by The Blueprints of Our lives, the mood created by the author is happyness.The mood in the memoir was happyness. It because the mother showed he how to love people. Quote she said... Always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love. It was there I learned the real difinition of ""family.""

Narciso talk about life at home and about his parents cooking. He is greatful for his parents cooking and how he learned from them. In paragraph three it states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that he considered people around him family and not just his blood relatives. He shows this by talking about how his surrogate grandparents lived in the basement and he didn't know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba. He is always grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. The whole memoir is about love, family which sets a positive mood for the reader."	3	3		3

When I hear about someone being that @CAPS1 it makes me think how times have changed from whe Narciso was growing up in the @NUM1's. He was so greatful and happy when compaired to now he has nothing. But he was abel to show all his gratude with the deepest heart warming simpathyall in all @CAPS2 learned from his parents and knew that family was the most important thing you can have.	2	2		2

3798	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain mood created by the other. This mood is a mix of many things. Love, generosity, and greatfulness. The Love feeling comes from the bond between friends and family. To them, family was your community and friends. They would let people stay at their house untill they got back on their feet, and often they would have many people join them for dinner.                                                                  The feeling of generosity comes from the selflessness the parents had for their kids, friends, and family. They would do kind things for them. They even immigrated from Cuba to have a better life for them and their children. The sence of greatfulness is from the friends and family, since the parents were so generous, people were greatful, and so was the author.

3804	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created in the memoir is a comfortable one. I know this because in paragraph three it says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" That shows that he was comfortable in that house and neighborhood that he had developed a family other than his blood relatives. Also in the last sentence of this memoir it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" That shows that the house had to be comfortable to him if he calls at home, because a home is a place for someone fells safe and comfortable."	4	2		2

3809	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very warm with lots of love. The author explains how him growing up in his environment had showed him that ""family"" didn't necessarily mean blood relative. Everyone in his neighborhood came together in ""great solidarity and friendship."" Whatever family members had went to the authors home, his parents would take them in no matter what because they knew if they were in the same situation they would be welcomed also. So for that they always kept their arms and door wide open to people they considered family.

Such as his friend and babysitter, Alegria, made him feel great, or how his parents gave him the love of cooking. One thing Narciso will never forget his parents love and sacrifice.

3813	5	The mood created by the author is the feeling of happiness and warmthe because he's talking about how he enjoyed his old home.	1	1		1																					
3815	5	they'd sald what little furniture they'd possessed by then	0	1		1																					
3816	5	The mood created by the author is touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm & segregation prevailed in the United States. Also b/c he had to share a house with alot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially & his parents couldn't find a jobs. That's why I think the mood is touching.	1	2		2																					
3817	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is the begining of the memoir he tells how his parents had a hard time coming to another country and having to deal with allot of problem and the mood is really sad or with allot of suspense and by the middle of the memoir he talks about how he grown up in a family that everbody was so happy and live most everbody together and they had allots of feast and that mood changed to a more happy mood or joyfull mood that he had with his family, and by the end he talks about he thank his parents for the person that he is and all the opportunities they give him and that change the mood to a thankful mood or a grateful mood. And that is how the author creates all the moods on the memoir.	2	3		3																					
3818	5	"The mood created by the author was mostly happiness and thankfulness. Narciso's parents came to the @LOCATION1 with courage without any knowledge of the language nor culture. Narciso feels thankful and graceful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. During the whole memoir, the designer is happy. He explained about how peaceful and grateful his... life with his ""family"" was by keeping is Cuban culture and heritage. The author said that the sense of family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. For paragraph @NUM1 and @DATE1, the mood was pretty sad because Narciso described what hardships his parents had to go through to come to the @LOCATION1. He said I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. During the whole memoir, the author describes how much he honors his parents such as how they not only told him life lessons but also showed him. Narciso Rodriguez ended the story with a happy mood by stating he loves his parents for everything they have done for him overall, this memoir had a variety of different moods at certain times depending on what the author was talking about. But mostly, the author was GRATEFUL."	3	3		3																					
3819	5	In the memoir the author creates a homey mood. he shows us the smells and tastes of the food, he shows love from his parents, and he shows grattitude for what he has.	1	1		1																					
3820	5	The mood created by the author was to me appreshiation, and some sympathy. Heres @NUM1 people that gave up their home, job, family, friends in the hope that they can live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. I have lots of appreshiation because its just another example to show how much our parents love and want the best fer us. I feel some-what bad fer the parents because they came from Cuba, and moved to @LOCATION1. They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take imagrants. Most jobs dont take imagrents, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. The love and detication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable. The mood set was appreshiation and simpathy for the people in this story.	2	3		3																					
3821	5	The mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. One of the memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also recalls his freinds and naybors that he used to have over. Even during a time of @CAPS1.S.A racism, the freinds still found ways to make them all happy and all got a long. Another fond memory he re-calls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in cuba but moved to @LOCATION1 in order to have a better home. This taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he finds the true deffinition of family.	3	3		3																					
3822	5	"The mood that the author, Narciso Rodriguez, created in the memoir was a feeling of unity and happiness. He explained his life, home, family, and parents. He said that, ""family"", was a great thing in that he learned the real definition. He said that he is most grateful for his caring and selfnassless parents. Narisco wrote about how you don't have to be a blood relative, to be family. He said that he is also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He said they showed him their lives and those teachings have been the basis of his life. He talked about his culture and how the heart of his home is his kitchen. He loves cooking and his parents taught him how to cook. He also said that in his neighborhood, cultures came together and there was unity and friendship. That was the mood created by the author in the memoir."	4	2		3																					
3825	5	"The mood created by the author was one of happiness, love, and caring. Not only does it show in his style, but the author also gives details that really create the vibe. In paragraph @NUM1, the author describes the food as ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" and the music as ""passionate Cuban music...mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This creates a homely affect to the scene, along with the paragraph about the many ""family members"" that came over for meals. The author describes this and explains that this was all possible, despite the nation's racism, because his parents worked hard to get where they were for the faith that their children would have a better life than they had. With all of the details, the author creates a loving, cultural affect can only be found with great family and friends."	3	3		3																					
3827	5	Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. The outcome of that is success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life.	2	3		3																					
3828	5	"The author creates a mood that he is very greatful to his parents. His parents taught him how to cook in a Cuban-style, (wich he loves to cook). ""(and for wich I am eternally greatful)."" His main greatfullness, is of their love and sacrifise. They would take in someone who needed time to get back on their feet, wich he found amazing. ""I will allways be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And he is not affraid to let them know, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repetedly."" @CAPS1 the memoir, the auther creates a mood that he is greatful to all his parents love and sacrifices, not only to himself, but to everyone they've helped."	3	2		3																					
3829	5	I feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness made up of many different moods. The other moods are reminisceance and hapiness. Thankfulness is focused on in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. Narciso Rodriguez talks about thankful he is his parents gave up so much to come to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were. He showed reminiscence by talking about what his house was like and what the people who made up the house were like. Lastly happiness which is mostly his mood when he remineses his past and family. Those are the moods of his meimor.	3	2		3																					
3831	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir was admiration. First of all @CAPS2 felt proud of his parents because they share ""Cooking duties and the work around the house."" @CAPS1 of all @CAPS2 felt @CAPS3 of knowing cuban background and @CAPS2 was proud because his parents were cuban. @CAPS2 was very admire by his parents because @CAPS2 was proud of being cuban two. These is the mood created by the author in the momoir."	1	2		2																					
3833	5	The author creates a loving, and caring mood. He makes it feel that you too could be invited into their home with open arms. That if you are feeling down they would pick you right up with a warm meal and a cozzy bead. He describes that they left Cuba to come to the land of oppertunities. That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1.	2	1		2																					
3835	5	the mood created by the author in the memoir was mutule in the begining it was about move to a New contrey they did seem faced by it they were more into giveing there child a better life and in the end it really sounds like they were all happy they welcomed people that moved from somwhere els into there home and welcomed them I think overall it was a happy mood that was created by the author	2	1		2																					
3836	5	"The mood created @CAPS1 the author in the memoir was grateful and loving. In one of the paragraphs, Narciso said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" @CAPS1 saying this, @CAPS2 is saying that @CAPS2 is grateful that his parents would give up their lives as they knew it for him. @CAPS2 said that @CAPS2 learned the real definition of ""family."" @CAPS2 knows that members in a family would give up anything to help another member of the family. @CAPS2 also said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" His family helped create a good home with love."	2	2		2																					
3839	5	"The author's mood was wondering and near the end, it changed you happiness. I thought the mood was wondering at first because he was wondering what ""home"" was all about. Then, it was changed to happiness because now the author knew what ""home"" is all about."	1	1		1																					
3840	5	"Fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez is a firm beiliever in friendship and family values. In a selection from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives, he describes the mood, or the feeling created by an author, in his childhood one of family and people with helping hands. Narciso says that everybody in his neighbor hood were ""immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows helpfulness espically in a time when racism and segregation were big in the States. Secondly, their was a sense of family in all of the people at Narciso's house. There was often people staying in his house because they temporarily needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. The Rodriguez's beilieved these people would do the same thing for them in return. Finally, Narciso can not express how grateful he is to have the importance of friends and family put on him so early in his life. Without his parents stressing the fact that family is not only your blood relatives, he would never have beilived that family and helping hands were so important. A mood of family qualities and helpfulness pre vails in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir. "	4	3		4																					
3843	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", what is the mood created by the author?The mood that the authors creates while writing this passage is very cultural like. Because she reason is. That he uses good detail in decribing the home of the character. For example, @CAPS1 Cuban music (which I adore to this day). This shows that there was some beautifull cultural music.Another way is that he is in a cultral mood is when he says. ""My young parents created our traditional cuban home."" This shows that they took what they had in Cuba and brang it to @LOCATION1. Also that they wanted it to be like home in which they miss.In this memoir there @MONTH1 have been other ways to describe the mood of what the author created. But I think the cultral mood is one of the bigger ones. Thats what I showed you in these two paragraphs."	1	2		2																					
3845	5	"The author in this memoir created a mood that showed how @CAPS1 felt about this house and his parents. He appreciated the house and was grateful for his parents. He is grateful for his parents and for their love and sacrifice. He is grateful they love and care for him. He says, ""I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 appreciates this house and how his parents made it into a home. He appreciates how his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family.So in this memoir the author created a mood that showed greatfulness and appreciation."	2	2		2																					
3849	5	"The @CAPS1 created by the author of the memoir is warm and inviting. In this quote the authors childhood is revealed and how he feels about it, ""The innocence of childhood, the congregation of the family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home. Also when the author says this it creats a happy @CAPS1 and shows how greatful he is to his parent's, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. The last qout wraps up his feeling about his life and how he feels ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love./I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote show the love and warmth of everyone in the family and how a house can bring people together. This showed the warmth, love and selflessness of the family."	4	4		4																					
3850	5	The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think thats what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up. Narciso also talked about what kinds of things happened at his house when he was a kid. One thing he talked about was how his landlords daughter was his first babysitter and first friend. He also talked about how his parents showed him thier cooking skills and thier passion for cooking.	2	1		2																					
3853	5	"The author created a mood in The memoir. The auThor use a mood of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The memoir. The auThor showed This by ""alegrai graced our kitchen table more often Than noT."" This shows That The auThor used a mood oF @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The memoir"	1	1		1																					
3854	5	"Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez is a memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives and it is about Narciso Rodriguez's early life. The major mood in the memoir is honesty and truthfulness. This is because the author talks about that you don't want to hear or that makes you sad to hear. For example, the author tells us about racism and how it was normal in the United States but the community overcame it: ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close � knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@NUM1). In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is honesty and truthfulness because the author tells us about things that might make us uncomfortable."	3	3		3																					
3855	5	"The mood in this memoir I believe  is appreciation and caring towards others. @NUM1 home as well as neighborhood was a place of unity and caring for one another like a family. In the memoir it says that people were always coming in and out of the house for a place to stay or for a meal to eat and were always welcomed with open arms. ""Family""  to him didn't mean you were related but were loved and cared for by other and with that mindset he had a huge family. His parent left behind their lives in Cuba where they were both scientists and had friends and family there for their son. They knew that the United States had better oppurtunitis for Narciso (in which he becomes a designer). He states several times how grateful he is of his parents for them to move to the @LOCATION3 for him as well as making his house feel like a home."	3	3		3																					
3857	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our Lives the overall mood of the author is greatfulness. Narciso begins the memoir by telling us how much @CAPS3 appreciates his culture and all that his parents do for him In paragraph @NUM1, ""... And unwittenly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking... (For which I am eternally greatful)"" @CAPS3 has an optemistic outlook on every aspect of his family and his culture. Most of it had to do with how @CAPS3 grew up and was born into a family who had just finished their hardships of getting int @LOCATION1."	2	2		2																					
3858	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was nostalgic. @PERSON1 remembers all the happy times he had, and memories that took place in his home. In paragraph two, he reflects back on how in his traditional Cuban home, where the heart was the kitchen. He remembers his parents love for cooking, and how eternally grateful he is it got passed down to him. @PERSON1 remembers the passionate Cuban music mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. In paragraph three and four, he tells how the environment he grew up in instilled that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative. He recalls past neighbors, and surrogate grandparents, his aunts and cousins. @PERSON1 remembers how there was always someone at the dinner table, and usually someone staying with them until they could get back on their feet. In paragraphs five, six, and seven, @PERSON1 expresses his gratitude towards his parents, and how much they had to sacrifice. He states that, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The home @PERSON1 lived in had many happy memories, and instilled that family and friends were important no matter what."	4	4		4																					
3861	5	"The mood of the memoir is appreciation. I think it's this mood because in the final paragraph the author says, ""... I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS1 fact is, in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 talks about how he kept thanking his parents for everything he had. He states, ""I've often told them that what they did is a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" I guess he is just very grateful for his parents, his childhood, everything and everyone he has ever met, had or done in his life. If I were in his shoes, I'd be grateful, too. This opened my eyes and now, I, too, am grateful for everything and everyone I have in my life."	2	3		3																					
3862	5	The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is very sensative way. And what I mean by that in paragrap @NUM1 and @NUM2 it sound's like the @CAPS1 is getting real emotional. It say's in paragraph @NUM1 I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and scrifice.	1	1		1																					
3864	5	"The @CAPS1 created by the auther is that in paragraph @NUM1 it States that ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home. It was verry heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwitting pakd onto me their rich culinary Skills and a love a cooking that is still with me today."" I think this relats to the @CAPS1 of the memoir because living in @LOCATION1 you could Still have a house and life stile like you were Still living back where you live, in this case in Cuba."""	2	2		2																					
3867	5	"The mood created in this story was happiness and greatfulness towards his parents. In the story he told the many sacrifices his parents made to give him a better life than the one they had. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" ""But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit of generosity."" His parents came to the country knowing little engish and having to start their lives over just so that his life would be better."	2	2		2																					
3869	5	The author creates a special mood in this memoir. The mood the author gives is a very comfortable mood. He talks about his family and how they all ate together and always had relatives stoping by. It gives you a sense of togetherness. It gives you a sense of how the family interacted and became one with the neighborhood. So the author of this article really shows how just the whole town had a sense of togetherness with the family.	2	2		2																					
3871	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I believe he goes from a calm mood to a proud mood. He starts off describing his life so far and family. How he used to live in a one-room apartment in Cuba and how his family lives in Newark, New Jersey along with other Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immagrints. Then he talks about the neighborhood and how together are great solidarity and friendships. Also, a honest and hard working community mostly immagrints. He also said, ""I will always be grateful to my for their love and sacrifice."" (paragraph @NUM1) I think Narciso feel thankful and proud to be a Cuban and have such wonderful parents. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (last sentence)"	2	3		3																					
3876	5	"The mood created by the author is welcoming. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. ""In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells and lovely cuban music playing. In conclusion, the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir, especially when he is describing his home"	3	3		3																					
3879	5	The author was so thankful, they explained how they thank there parrents for moving here. And how a house can become a  home and how important family and friends relationships are	2	2		2																					
3881	5	"The mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez's love. Love is the mood for many reasons. One reason is that Narciso's parents were very caring. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM1). Narciso's parents cared about everybody as if they were part of the family. Another reason the mood is love is because Narciso talks about how his parents were selfless. With courage they moved to @LOCATION1 without knowledge of the lanunguage or the culture."" They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM2). @PERSON2's parents did everything out of pure love. Because of them @PERSON2 lived a life filled with happiness and love."	3	3		3																					
3883	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was a happy and grateful mood. Some evidence to back up my thinking is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""and for which I am extremily grateful."" @CAPS1 can tell that the author wants @CAPS1 to also feel grateful. Another example in paragraph @NUM2 where is says ""I will never-forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" that quote showed me how satisfied with how his life is now and how much the author is appreciative for what his parents did for him.""I've often told them my admiration for thier strength and persevearence and iv'e thanked them repeatedly"". That also show how the author was pushing to make the mood grateful. It also shows how the author is happy about his parents desisions."	4	3		4																					
3886	5	"What is the mood, created by the author in the memoir? The mood created by the author in the memoir would be loving/warmth. The fact that Narciso's parents would take people in, until they can get back on their feet. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Narciso's parents moved to another country to give their children a better life. The sacrificed everything everything leaving their families, friends, and career. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing I could have ever done."" The home that they are in now is very special to Narciso. Basically, his first everything was done there. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" The mood created by the author made me feel grateful for what I have in life."	4	3		4																					
3888	5	The mood created by the author is welcoming and warm. The author makes it so that you want to be @CAPS1 and being able to smell the good food. Also just being able to appreciate the cuban culture.	1	2		2																					
3889	5	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, from: Home: the blue prints of our lives, the mood created by the author is happy, thankful and also familyorented. First @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"", and which by that you can tell @CAPS1 loved that new home, and that @CAPS1 loved and appriciated everything her parents did for her.Second, ""... instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative"". Which @CAPS3 that @CAPS1 treats and acts like everyone is her ""family"", because @CAPS1 loves and cares for all of he ""family"" that isn't blood relative in her neighborhood as if the were blood relative.Last, the memoir says ""... endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". @CAPS1 says ""warm home,"" that ment @CAPS1 loved being home with her family/etc. And that @CAPS1 loved being with her friends and neighbors, because thats what @CAPS1 loved/loves to do. therefore @CAPS1 is happy."	4	3		4																					
3893	5	In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood treated each other as family, though they were all struggling to get buy. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot. Narciso's parents had highly skilled well paying jobs in Cuba and they were forced to get whatever jobs they could find in @LOCATION2. They would always help someone in their family if necesary, and often did. Narciso's family made the best of being poor, and managed to get by. They did all this without loosing their culture (Cuban music and food). Their entire neighborhood, one big family, survived and thrived on little. Being a blood relative wasn't the only defenition of family in their part of Newark, New Jersey.	2	2		2																					
3896	5	"The mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in this memoir is special, loving but most prominantally gratitude.Time and time again the author shows his gratitude toward his parents for making life for him growing up special in a loving atmosphere. He describes how grateful he is for his parents cooking in paragraph @NUM1 when he says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" In the same paragraph he mentions the music, ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air [...]"". His parents taught him to be open and loving to others as said in paragraph @NUM2 ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This also taught him a sense of what family really is and that it has nothing to do with being a blood relative but a loving friendship and sense of respect and caring. I feel he best expresses his gratitude in paragraph @NUM3 when he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" and in paragraph @NUM4 and he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.""

3900	5	In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up this way.	2	3		3																					
3901	5	"The author in the memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our lives creates the mood of gratitude and admiration towards his parents.One example of how the author shows gratitude is by mentioning how thankful he is toward his parents. Specific textual evidence that proves this is ""... unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This quotation creates the mood of appreciation by simply stating ""eternally grateful"". Furthermore, another textual evidence which proves my thesis is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 the authors use and repititon of the word ""grateful"", or ""thankful"" creates a mood.Another example of how the author creates a mood is by showing admiration for his parents. According to the text he says ""I've often told my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" This quotation is important because it shows that he has told them he admires them. The author also creates the mood of admiration when he says ""... what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" @CAPS2 this quotation the author recognizes that his parents faced many hardships, and praises them by showing his admiration."	3	4		4																					
3902	5	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 is very cozy and welcomeing. Inside the @PERSON1 home the @CAPS1 describes a cozy and friendly atmospher. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed bot, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This quote shows how cozy or ""warm"" their home is. In the memoir he also explains how welcome people are and that everyone in the Apartment building was friends or even family! ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me the great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote means that in his welcomeing home friends were also concidered his family. Narciso Rodriguez had a wonderful @CAPS2 to grow up in."	2	3		3																					
3903	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir."	3	2		3																					
3904	5	The mood that is described in this story is love. Why did I pick love? I picked love because in the story it says a lot of stuff about family and Cuba and home (Cuba, is where the love (family) is. In this story is states that his love comes from his family and love comes from every family and @PERSON1's loves his family he says it alot in the story.	1	1		1																					
3905	5	In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story.	2	3		3																					
3909	5	The mood in the memoir, which the author is trying to show you is pretty much the happiness and gratefullness that Narciso Rodriguez has to be cuban. Narciso is bringing the mood of happiness in this memoir learning all about his Cuban background and how much he is greatful for his mom and dad. The author is trying to show you appriciation and gratefulness. This whole memoir is trying to show readers how great it is to come from different cultures and know how to make and do different things. This memoir is representing good moods and happiness. To always be grateful for what you have in you life, exspecially your family, friends, & your life. The mood in this memoir is very happy and gratefull	2	2		2																					
3911	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives there is a mood of happyness created. There are several examples from the article that show happyness. The first example is ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their child a better life"". Narciso's parents left everything they had just to give their son a better life. This made him happy because he knew his parents loved him and would do anything for him. The second example is ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows he is very aware all his parents did for him and makes him truly happy knowing they care for him that much. The third and final example is ""It was here I learded the true definition of family."" Where he moved to his parents, siblings, and neighbors became his ""family"" and although he didn't know all of his ""real"" family he was happy with the one he had. Those three examples show the mood of the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez""."	3	4		4																					
3912	5	"The mood created by the author's tone in this memoir is appreciation which is displayed in three important places. First, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, creates the mood of appreciation when talking about how his parents lef cuba. He explains ""they came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM1). This description shows the mood of appreciation because it shows the author's parents left ""selflessly"", ""to give their children a better life,"" which implies that his parents @MONTH1 not have wanted to come to @LOCATION1, but they knew it would be the best place for him, so they came anyway, which clearly creates a mood of appreciation through Narciso's tone. Additionally, the mood of appreciation created when Rodriguez declares ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" (@NUM2). This informs the reader outright that rodriguez is"" ""greatful to his parents"", which creates the mood of appreciation should through his tone. Finally, the mood of appreciation is created when Narciso states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM3). This statement insinuates appreciation because Rodriguez is informing the reader that ""he will never forget"", what his parents have done for him, which carries the message that it changed his life, creating the mood of appreciation through his tone. In conclusion, Narciso Rodriguez creates the mood of appreciation through his tone in this memoir to his parents."	4	4		4																					
3913	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the author creates a very powerful and posative mood. One strong example of this is how he expresses his parents. He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like ""always be greatful for my parents"",  ""admiration for their strength"", ""perseverance"", and ""generosity."" The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set. Narciso Rodriguez expresses a very positive and powerful mood about his family and his culture throughout the excerpt."	3	3		3																					
3916	5	The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a ceartain mood in his memoir. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family is the moood is because of the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood realitives. It is also because everyone even if they weren't related was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt every one was to him. A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family. They always came over and had dinner babysat him and every thing that is why it is love.	2	2		2																					
3917	5	As I read the article, also called memoir, I didn't so much find a certain mood that the author had created. This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them.	3	3		3																					
3918	5	"The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life, and for that he is grateful."	3	2		3																					
3921	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home."	3	3		3																					
3922	5	"A happy, grateful, and proud mood is expressed by the author in this memoir. The author, Narciso, expressed a grateful and happy mood by describing things his parents did for him that he was grateful for, as well as happy to have. ""... a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The author also expressed his pride in the story, by stating and describingwhat his parent's did that he was proud of. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) These were the moods the author expressed in the memoir."	3	3		3

Having friends come over relatives and non- relatives is great. You have a better mood in the day to come.	1	1		1																					
3925	5	The mood that the author created in this memoir is kinda sad because these imegrents that came to know america slefliss just to give thier children a better life. These imagrents do not have a lot to work with. They live in small homes that are durty but in a suprizing way the manage. All these imagrents from different cultures that live in the same neiborhood came together in great soldarity and frendship. There are other imigrents that are unlucky and don't find jobs or houses, they have to eather leave or stay tempory with other people until they get back on their feet. In conclusion in this memoir the author created a very sad mood as you can see from the some of the spesific deatils from the story I have included.	1	2		2																					
3927	5	The mood in the story is very homely and happiness. The author clearly loved their childhood and was filled by great experiences and a loving background. The author was very greatful for the parents for what they have done. For moving to @LOCATION1, making sacrifices, wanting a better life for them. Also how their home was a great enviroment. always open, cozy, and loving. The mood of the cooking, family coming together, and of the cheerful music is just great.	3	3		3																					
3934	5	"There are Many ways I can explain the @CAPS1 created by the author in the @CAPS2.One way I can explain the @CAPS1 created by the author in the @CAPS2 is That he is so greatfull for having Parents that care about him and want him to get a good edication.The second way is that @CAPS1 is always happy at his home, he always has some cuban spirit in his house. his perents cook cuban food and have There Family together.The third way is that he Loved his house how his perents Made it so confortible and his perents made so many of his birthdays there, he had a great time at that house ""I will never forget how my parents turned his simple house into a home""This are some of the ways I explained the @CAPS1 created"	2	2		2																					
3936	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy setting. In the memoir, the setting is a happy setting, in a sense of living because in the passage, there are parenthesis that explain how much the narrator appreciAtes his family and his heratige. In the passage in paragraph @NUM1, it explains how the families are close and help those in need, even wheN things arent going so soomthly for them. Also there are certain words in the passage that would help with the mood, words such as selflessly, solidary, love, friendship, and sacrifice. In my opinion, this words help bring the mood to a happy, calming feeling to the passage. The ""happy"" mood is created by the authoR in this memoiR."	2	2		2																					
3940	5	"Throughout Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, he potrays a happy, uplifting, positive mood that explains how close his family was and what being a family means to him. It also describes how grateful he is toward his parents and how proud he is of his Cuban culture.First of all, Narciso believes that to be a family, you don't have to be blood related to that person. In paragraph @NUM1, he says: ""� All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close � knit community�"" This quote explains how much he valued his friends, neighbors, and other family members; and how all three of these categories formed the house he called home.Secondly, the mood of the memoir was not only centered around family and friends, but Narciso also showed much gratitude toward his parents. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life�"" And the later in paragraph @NUM3. he says, ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" These two quotes explain how much he admires his parents, and this feeling of admiration and thanks played large part in the mood of Narciso's memoir.Finally, @PERSON2's Cuban pride was another large contributor in the mood of this excerpt. In paragraph @NUM4, it describes how he adores Cuban music to this day and how his ""parents created their traditional Cuban home"" @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM5, he says, ""� a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.""

And all three of these things helped make his ""house a home."""	4	4		4																					
3944	5	"The @CAPS2 is trying to describe his house when he was a kid. In this case he describes his Cuban heritage and how being @CAPS1 is really fun and amazing. The @CAPS2 is saying that the Cuban kitchen is pouring out with amazing foods and during holidays his ""Family"" would come and visit. Cuban is a very exciting culture is what pops into my head after reading this story. The mood is that festivitys and holidays are the best for him."	1	0		1																					
3945	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir would be how fortunite we are to be living here in the united States and how lucky we are to have our education and our friends and families here with us. For example in paragraph @NUM1 when he says ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This is the mood created by the author in the memoir."	1	1		1																					
3946	5	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is their feelings.In paragraph @NUM1, lines @NUM2, it says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home.""For that quote, the authors mood is sometimes sad and sometimes happy. The author's mood about being sometimes sad is because of how they live. The author's mood about feeling sometimes happy is because no matter what happens they still have their friends and family, or each other.In paragraph @NUM3, lines @NUM3 and @NUM5, it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.""For that quote, the authors mood is srprised and thankful. The author's feeling is suprised because she would never think her parent would do that for her. The author's feeling is thanksful because thats what her parents did for her made her life better.All and all, that was the mood created by the author."	4	1		4																					
3952	5	"The mood of the author Narciso Rodriguez was he was always proud of his culture and mom and dad. For example in paragraph two it talks about @CAPS1 where he lived and how he said that he ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)"". ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). In the story @PERSON2 always excepted anything and was kind and always wanted to see his parents smile. And he was positive and honest. And he even talked about his community ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" And Narciso also said ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."""	3	3		3																					
3953	5	The way this author wrote this memoir, he @CAPS1 created multiple moods. The main mood he created was thankfulness. He continues on about how thankfull he is that his parents aborted their lives to make his life better. The author really emphasizes how thankful he is that his parents did this for him. Since his parents did this for him he has even become a clothing designer. The author of this memoir is very thankfull. This author also creates other moods such as happieness and sadness. This author creates many moods in this memoir.	1	2		2																					
3957	5	"In the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez he created a mood of happiness and joyfulness. Narciso Rodriguez creates this mood by showing the generosity his parents have towards their son, family and friends. I also feel another mood that Narciso expresses is love.iI say this because his parents sacrifice everything they had because they wanted a better Life for their son. ""The faith that this struggle with lead them and their children to better times dove them to endure these hard times"". In this quote is love. Narciso's parent's new that for him to have a better life they would need to sacrifice thirs. That is why i feel love is a mood protrayed in the memoir."	3	2		3																					
3962	5	The mood in the memoir is happy and thankful. I think this because the memoir is talking about how this boy apreshiates that his parents moved just so he can have a better life. I know this because in the last paragraph the boy talks about his family and how he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house to a home. So thats the mood of the memoir.	2	1		2																					
3963	5	"In the memoir, the author created a mood. The mood was a very good one that shows everyone that reads it, that the human race can be genuinely kind and helpful. No matter what race you are or where you come from, you don't have to be blood related to be ""family"" and we can all extend a hand to the people that need the most help. The author's parents gave him great love and sacrificed alot for him; @CAPS1 is very thankful to them for that. @CAPS1 tells them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then @CAPS1 could've ever done and @CAPS1 has great admiration for their strength and perseverance. Being an immagrant you have to be unselfish because most parents do it to give their children a better life. The author learned the real definition of ""family"" and for that, @CAPS1 said @CAPS1'll never forget that house or the many things about how to love. In the memoir, it creates a peaceful mood."	3	2		3																					
3969	5	"The mood in this memoir ranges from happiness to love. One type of mood in this story is uplifting hapiness. You can see that because throughout the story there is so much positivity and warmth. It is almost contagious how the author tells the story of his cherished years of childhood which is made up of hapiness. One example is, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote emphasizes the hapiness and uplifting cheer from the authors endless childhood of home. Another mood this memoir gives is gratefulness and gratitude to the authors family and home. For example, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This quote shows that the author can only give thanks to his loving parents who did everything to insure a great life. The author grew up loving his home filled with culture and family. A third mood in this memoir is compassion and dedication. This memoir shows that because even with moving to a new country with new people the family still keeps his childhood filled with culture of who they are. They don't hide it because of their struggles and hardships or anything. An example of compassion and dedication is, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This quote shows that they keep constant custom of their cultures warmth and detiration. Nothing has stopped them from living life how they chose."	4	4		4																					
3971	5	The Originally from cuba arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnshed one-room aparment @NUM1 old Rawedia maria and @NUM2 year old @PERSON1.                                                                         In 1961, I was Born into this simple house, situated in a @NUM3 family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey.

3973	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was grateful in the beginning of his memoir. Evidence from the text that supported this is paragraph @NUM1 it stated ""(and for which I am eternally grateful.)""The second mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was thankful. He was thankful because his parants were immigrants and came to the country without knowing any language or the cultureThe last mood created by the author in the memoir was that he felt loved. He felted loved because his parents sacrifice for him. They welcomed many things in Narciso life. those are three moods that were created by the author in the memoir"	2	3		3																					
3974	5	The mood the author created was a good mood. It is a good mood because it is telling you about his life he has. He has a good life because he has good and nice parents. He is wealthy. He has no trouble like getting punished. His parents are wealthy and they have a good job. The author did a good job make this story happy and not sad.	1	1		1																					
3976	5	The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, is a upbeat & happy mood. I know this because he states that he is very grateful for his parents to pass down the cooking recipes and skills, and the Cuban music that they would listen to.This is the mood @PERSON1 creates in the memoir.	2	2		2																					
3978	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the aurthor displays a mood. The mood is very calm and grateful as he explains how he feels to have his cuban culture and lifestyle. Explaining how his family loves cooking and playing music. The author just explains how he lived when he was with his parents. Then the author gets more detailed talking about who lived with him like his landlord and his daughter; his two granparents and others. The author just creates a calm and grateful mood to this memoir.	2	2		2																					
3982	5	"The @CAPS1 is trying to make the reader understand Narciso Rodriguez feelings by describing how little Narciso had grown up with and how hard it must have been for him to live in that type of enviroment and home. for example ""In 1961 i was born into this simple house, situated two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This quote @CAPS4 how even from his early days being as a child Narciso was still living in poor enviroments and did not have much at all. The @CAPS1 @CAPS4 the unhappiness in the Rodriguez family and how they are struggling to make everything better @CAPS2 the end of the memior the @CAPS1 @CAPS4 the happiness and how proud the family is because they are now doing a lot better then they were before. for example ""I will never forget how my parents turned a house into a home"".

3983	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is a nonstalgic mood is created from his memories. The mood is created by his parents and where he lives. One way the mood is nonstalgic is he's grateful towards his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). By being grateful towards his parents, he is helping the nonstalgic mood grow. Also, where he live helps the mood. ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home those"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Since his parents turned his house, to a home he will never forget what they did for him, making this memoir more nonstalgic.

3990	5	In this memoir, the mood is very pleasant and makes you think of childhood memories. The reason is because he talks about how his parents guided him to be a strong-willed man, and he couldn't have done it unless he had the conditions he did then. He seems to think that if he didnt have the parents and oppurtunities he did then, his life would have been much different. So, the mood in this poem makes you feel like home is where the heart is.	2	1		2																					
3993	5	"In the story ""@PERSON1"", the mood created by the author is loving and peaceful. For example, Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing the aroma of the kitchen. This shows that the home is peaceful. Another example is, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we consider family. This shows her family is kind and loving. lastly, I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. They shows she loves her parents very much and always will.

3995	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. The mood of the memoir is loving because Narciso's home reminds him of his old country.

I know this becacus he did not talk badily about anything and he talked about how his parents helped him and other people as a kit. in paragraph two he was talking about how his house was nice and comsortabur. I know this because he sais. the love of cooking and the passioniate Cuban music.	1	1		1																					
4002	5	"A) The mood that was created in this memoir was a basic mood. It wasn't a happy or sad in was a flat mood, because Its talking about how their in debt needed to move the kid lost all of his friends. The kid can't attend school because they can't afford any type of education. so that is why its a basic or flat mood. I also belive its a basic mood because it says that ""kids have to do a lot of the work"" because They are the youngest and the older can't do that work or they will get hurt. Towards the end It gets to a happy mood because it say ""my parents will always be there for me."""	2	1		1

For example, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a relative."" Family is very valuable, and a great wealth to Narciso, and throughout the memoir he keeps bringing the feelings of family. It's seem like that emotion was give that held everything together and would make it all ok! He also experiences great gratitude towards his parents and his neighbors; ""But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit and generosity impressed on me at a such an early age and be demonstration or how important family and friends are.""

He describes in good detail all the sacrifices his parents made for him. Leaving behind all their friends and family, the hot climate, and their cultures back in Cuba. Another mood expressed in the memoir is love and kindness. Narciso's parents were kind to everyone. They turned their house into a hotel for people who needed help until they were ready to go. They had open dinner where friends and family members came. Even when they struggled financially they still let everyone in. Narciso's parents made the biggest sacrifice for him. What they did for him created the beautiful moods described in the memor.	2	3		3																					
4028	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was good. Her memoir was good because in 1961 they moved to a simple house only for two-familys. with blond-bricks building in the ironbound in @LOCATION1.

Narciso Rodriguez is now a recognized clothing designer, but as a child she also had a great life ful of laughter and love. She grew up in a two family home within Newark, New Jersey. I can now smell, hear, and picture  the inside of where Narciso grew up. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today, and for which I am eternally gratefull."" This sentence gives me an image of that happy family and puts me in a good mood, While it reminds me of my our family and the memories that we share among our kitchen. Passionate Cuban music, which I adore to this day, filled the air mixing with the aromas in the kitchen. This sentence puts me in a really excited mood because it reminds me of when my own house is filled with loud music during the summertime. Narciso Rodriguez definitily created a mood in this selection, and it was a good one."	2	3		3

(paragraph @NUM1). A second way the author sets the mood is by sneaking in deeper thoughts within the paragraphs and parentheses. For example in paragraph @NUM2. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" A third way the author sets the mood is by speaking so fondly of their parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". (paragraph @NUM3). The overall mood that the author sets for this memoir is a kind, sweet and thankful mood, Narciso Rodriguez, is thankful for many thing; family, culture and living in america."	4	3		4																					
4037	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that Narciso is @CAPS2 with his life and @CAPS1 would do nothing to change that.

This showed that the family was still @CAPS2 in the country they were in now but before was good too. Narciso says in paragraph @NUM4, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" Narciso loves his family and is thankful for everything they've done for him. The overall mood to this memoir was @CAPS2, @CAPS2 that the family gets to share so many great, And fun moments together."	4	3		4																					
4039	5	"The mood in this memoir is very happy and uplifting. This memoir can pick the spirits up of any person in poverty that does not like the home they live in or their family. The memoir shows that even if you are poor, with your family and friends, you can be happy. In the last sentence of the memoir it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Which shows that you can make the best of any situation with family and friends. Narciso and his family became successful and had a good life because of their positive attitude"	2	1		2																					
4042	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there are different moods. Three different moods are happiness, enjoyable and, grateful.Throught this memoir he seems very happy. He's happy about where he lives and happy that he has a caring and nice family, ""In our neighborhood, dispite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""@CAPS1 mood in this memoir is enjoyable.

4046	5	"The author set a great mood of love and gratefulness in this memoir. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 explains that his parents left Cuba with quite goods jobs. His father worked in a laboratory and his mother studied chemical engineering. They both came to the @LOCATION2 and had to work in whatever job they could find, although they deserved much better ones. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is very thankful for what his parents have done, how much they have given up in order for their kids to have a better life His parents showed him in their everyday lives the spirit of how to be generous at such an early age, and the true importance of family and friends. They didn't just ""tell"" him to live this way, they based their lives in this belief. that's the reason @CAPS1 has taken these teaching to be the basis of his life. These are the ways in which the author sets a mood of love and gratefullness in this memoir."	3	3		3																					
4047	5	I think the memoir has a happy and grateful mood. He talks about how thankful he is to have such a good family and that he can call his home a home. I think that when readers read this memoir will make them think how thankful they should be with being blessed with people that love them and having eachother. I just think the memoir sets a happy mood.	1	2		2																					
4050	5	The mood the author created in memoir was that of happiness and acception. Even though Narciso Rodriguez is Cuban, as well as his family, he fit into his neighborhood, and most likely made a lot of friends very quickly. This gave a feeling of acception as well as a lot of happiness. That is the mood that the auther set on the story.	1	1		1																					
4051	5	"The mood that the @CAPS1 created in the memoir is @CAPS2. The @CAPS1 talks about his parents immigrated to @CAPS4 so that he can have a better education. He tells us how they welcomed people into their home whenever they were in need. In the excerpt it says, ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh Northern winters while yearning for their Native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS5 his parents faced many conflicts, they were still there, and he is very greatful for that. This just shows how much the @CAPS1 @CAPS7 them, and how thankful he is."	2	2		2																					
4055	5	The mood created in the memoir is a happy and caring and also sometimes sad. It was happy when he got together with family members but caring when his family let random strangers stay with them until they got on there feet it was sad When he couldne see his grandparents till they got permission from cuba.	2	1		2																					
4056	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is gratefulness. Narciso often explains how thankful he is to his parents. Like When he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

He than talks about all of the good times that they have, and than, he thanks them one more time."	2	2		2																					
4059	5	In the memoir, the author creates lots of moods. First of all, the author creates this mood that makes you want to cry. While there is a kind of Love mood here. Narciso loves his home because that's where he grew up and he cherished it. Also, Narciso is graceful that he got the chance to grow up in @LOCATION1. Finally, he's happy that he has a Cuban culture and that he has good caring parents. The author has good moods.	1	2		2																					
4061	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was the love your home and all of the people around it. The author is gratefull for all of the skills that her parents taught her like cooking, which she said that she was grateful for and also music. She loves to cook and listen to cuban music. She also loves all of the people around her home and how they all came together in unison even though they were all different cultures. She is grateful for all that her parents sacrificed to give her a better life. That is what I think was the mood of the memoir created by the author is.	2	2		2																					
4064	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was love. One way that he expressed this in the memoir was by saying that his man had let in other immigrants to their house. Also a way that this was expressed was by saying that his parents selflessly left Cuba to get a better life for their children. Furthermore the author of the memoir expressed this by saying that his family turned this simple house into a home. This is the mood that the author created in the memoir	2	2		2																					
4065	5	"The mood the @CAPS1 creats in the memoir is a mixture. In reading the story you feel happy, and greatfull, this is because the @CAPS1 is stating how great her family and friends were, along with how great her life was. She also states that you dont need alot of money or a big house to be happy. In paragraph @NUM1 she says ""I will always be greatfull to my parets for their love and sacrifice."" This says to me, that very happy and she very greatfull to have parents like she does and that she would never want to loose them.

4070	5	The mood the author created was a peaceful mood. She was bringing up good memories of her past life in her home.

Her parents tought her much about her heritage when she was young and kind, she lived in a very diverse area growing up there were Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2. There were times of racism and violence. The overall mood she created in this memoir was sad, happy and peaceful.	2	2		2

4073	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author created a mood. First of all in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says ""here the innocent of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, endless celebrations... That formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This means that the author was trying to convey a happy sort of mood the setting that they were surrounded with me that the foundation to their warm spirited home as it said ""the backdrop life of our warm home."" @CAPS1 it also has a homey feeling. Second of all it also says ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This means that he felt he was close enough to everybody in his community it was like family. They were all each other had anything not matter where they came from. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 Narciso says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength, and perseverance, and thank them repeatedly for that.""

4075	5	"In the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez described their childhood home. The author creates a mood in this memoir.The mood is created by description of the kindness of his neighbors, his gratitude toward his parents, and how his house was turned into a home. The mood is created by a description of the kindness of his neighbors. Narciso talks about his neighbor hood, calling it ""a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" Narciso is getting the point across that his community was a warm, loving place, where everyone was friends and there was no conflict. Narciso also talks about his gratitude towards his parents. He says that, ""They came selflessly, as many imigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Here, the mood is set as grateful, since if his parent had not given all that they had had, he would of been in a worse situation in Cuba. Narciso sets the mood by talking about his home. He says that, ""Countless extended family members came and went -- and there was often some one staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" This adds to the warmth of his home, giving in a warmer environment.The mood in this memoir is set by @PERSON1' parents' determination, the kindness of his community, and the open arms of his home. All of these thing are the definition of family."	4	4		4																					
4078	5	"Narciso Rodriguez, a clothing designer, wrote a memoir on his ideas about family. I believe the author set a very personal mood in this story. This is not unexpected considering it is a memoir however there were few statement facts and everything was personal experience. Along with personal the memoirs also show a very loving and happy lifestyle they lived. For example there was always Cuban music playing along with Cuban food and the parents would always host a person in the house is time to get back on their feet. Above all the author clearly shows his love for his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" With this the author clearly shows the mood for love and happiness."	2	3		3																					
4082	5	"The mood of this memoir is happy and grateful. The narrator is grateful for all the great times in life him and his parents had together. He is happy that said ""times"" were so great.He is grateful for the happy times they had together like cooking, music, and so on. But he is mostly grateful for his parents turning his house into a home."	2	1		2																					
4083	5	"I think the mood in the memoir is love. I think this because the whole memoir is about family, friendships, and relationships. For example in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""countless extended family members came and went- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily, until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" In this quote I believe it is saying that everyone you know and love is part of your family and that you should always be available to help, just as they will too. The mood of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is love and that you should always be their for your family and your family will always be there for you."	2	2		2																					
4085	5	"The author sets many moods for the reader in his memoir from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives. The first and most dominant mood is a sense of family or friendship. The author constantly describes how his family's generosity made his apartment into a friendly place with the constant coming and going of relatives, distant and close. Next the author installed a sense of warmth. The very idea of this family moving from cuba into this three room apartment for their son really gives any reader some sense of warmth. Finally the author gives us a Sense of culture. As early as paragraph @NUM1 the author writes...""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful. Passionate Cuban music (which I still adore today) filled the air..."" In these ways, the author reaches out to his readers with the mood of friendship, warmth, and culture to give us a taste of his life with his adoring parents in this small three room house he called home."	3	2		3																					
4087	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the mood created by the author is gratefull and family. Throughout the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez talks about his life growing up. Readers read things like: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage,"" and ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1, towards the end, the author explains that he is very grateful to have his parents: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."", and ""in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generousity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" @CAPS2, Narciso Rodriguez was greatly influenced by his family during his childhood, and his memoir shows that along with how grateful he will always be."	3	3		3																					
4090	5	In the memoir the author obviously seems to be grateful and thankful because he states it multiple times in the passage. When he is recalling all the memories he had it proves to be a warm and happy mood. The cookings skills that his parents passed on to him he says that he's grateful for and passionate Cuban music he says that he still adores to this day. The author also states that there's not only a sense of family in being a blood relative but in the neighborhood as well. All the different cultures of his neighborhood; Spanish, Cuban and Italian came together in a great solidarity and friendship. The author is so thankful in fact that he's actually told his parents that he could have never done something as courageous as they did. The mood of the memoir is so strong in a positive way because he also writes that there is no way for him to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon him at such an early age. To wrap up his memoir he mentions that he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home.	3	4		4

4098	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is being together. This mood is created by saying how his parents created a traditional cuban home in New Jersey. Also, when he said that that his parents always kept open arms and door. I think that ment that they were willing to let people stay with them and help them out when they were having a hard time. Also, when he said that everyone in the neighborhood despite there customs came together in friendship.	2	2		2

4109	5	"The story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", has a comfortable and loving mood. This memoir sounds almost cozy, in some ways. If you read paragraph @NUM1, you can imagine just how happy the kitchen table was when @LOCATION1 (landlord's daughter), Sergio, and Edelmira (""surrogate grandparents"") were around it. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, it talks about the Passionate and Cuban music"" that filled the air ""and the ""aromas of the kitchen"". If that doesn't sound like a comfortable place, I don't know what does! Love must have been a main factor in the author's life because it is evident in the excerpt. This story talks about all the people that would come over the house, friends and family, too, and how everyone there was cared for no matter what. The first sentence in paragraph @NUM3 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" That alone says how much love there was in the house.

In this quote is saying straigh up how he feels, which is grateful. You can also tell that he is implying that he loves his parents. Another quote that supports my main idea is The author says, ""... There is no way to express my gratitude..."" In this quote, just like the last one the author is saying directly how he feels, which is again greatful.

To start off, Narciso had so much love and appreciation for his parents decision to immigrate to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 Narciso says, ""There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age."" The purpose of the author writing this was to strongly show how truly greatful Narciso is for the hardships his parents had to endure to give him a better life.

In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. They showed me with their own lives & these teachings have been the basis of my life. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent & music but life & love. It was here where i learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love.

The love & friendship @CAPS1 shared with the people of his neighborhood is also shown in that same paragraph & as well as the other ones too. @CAPS1 shows so much love & thanks to his family & friends & his whole entire neighborhood in his last paragraph. Yet most of all to his parents in his last sentence.

4121	5	Based on the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the ovor all mood is thankfull. It is that full because he is thankfull his parents came to america and that his connenity is helpfull.

4122	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very cool and funky. I say this not to make fun of anyone but to thank them. The author says that his parents unwittingly passed on their skills and love for cooking. This piece of evidence is located in paragraph two. The mood is described as joyous, giddy, excited, and elated. This is because the author is starting to figure out what it's like to have a ""family that isn't related by blood but by race and culture. This evidence is located in paragraph @NUM1. The authors parents invited refugees to stay with them until the got back on their feet. His/@CAPS1 parents did this so whenever they needed anything than they would be alright. This final piece of evidence is located in paragraph seven. These are pieces of evidence that describe the mood of the memoir. (And also of where they are located)."	2	2		2																					
4123	5	This story, basically, brings me back memories myself. In the memoir, the author feels a happy, strong, lovable mood. He feels as @CAPS1 those times, are never going to be forgettable, that he's always going to remember those times. That once he gets older, he will take these good times, as granted. Even during bad times, he will look back. Also he will always be thankful, for what his parents have done, to make his life better, and esier. That way he wouldn't have to life a hard depressed life. Hopefully he will always be thankful for that oppertunity, that his parents gave him. I know that @CAPS1 my parents did that for me, I would never forget them.	1	1		1

4136	5	In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, there is a main mood created by the author. I think this mood is happiness. To Narciso and his whole entire family, family is the most important thing. No one leaves a family member out. In his neighborhood there mostly lived, Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. All these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso's parents came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.

Third, he describes his friends and family who visited often. Their landlord and his daughter, Alegria; his surrogate grandparents Sergio and Edelmira; His aunts Bertha and Juanita; his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary; the list goes on. His parents let all who needed a home to stay with them, because they knew that the others would help them if they needed shelter. Finally Narciso described the hardships and sacrifices his parents made for him, for which he is eternally grateful. His parents left behind friends, family, and their good jobs to start anew in @LOCATION3, also that he would live a better life than they.

And very generous because her parents moved for her education. and to get good money to make us happy. The girl's parents welcome anyone into their home as family, and thats why she loves them too. But I have to say she's mostly grateful. Because her parent's are doing every thing to make her happy, and they even have to accept getting a job they dont even like. And for their love and sacrifice. And that's what mood the author feel's in the story.	2	2		2

Another thing is @PERSON1 would always praise his parents throughout the whole story. He would talk about how selfless and kind they were. He thanks them for his success in life. I believe that if it was very brave of @PERSON1's parents to move to the United States, but they did it for their children. @PERSON1 ends the article with a very inspirational quote.

The love of the authors parents is shown in paragraph @NUM1, when it says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life..."" Love from the author's parents is shown again in paragraph @NUM1 when it says ""The faith that this struggle would leave them and their children to better living drove them to endure these hard times."" These two quotes show the love that the author's parents showed towards their children. A mood of hospitality was also shown in this memoir a lot. In paragraph @NUM3, it shows hospitality by saying ""it was a close-knit community of... immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" This shows the hospitality of the neighborhood and how caring it was. The other mood that the author created in the memoir was gratitude in paragraph @NUM4, this is shown. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told him that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This quote shows how massively grateful the author is toward her parents.

(I would not know my 'real' grand parents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, unil 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" It @CAPS2 that it is bittersweet because even though Rodriguez had ""grandparents"", @CAPS1 didn't meet his actual grandparents until later on in his life.Another way Rodriguez makes the mood bittersweet is by talking about his parents. @CAPS1 writes, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""

Narciso said, ""she's internally grateful to know how to cook, and she still enjoys listening to cubic music."" Its a happy mood, showing memory. Another example is, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture.""

4234	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir is in my opinion pure happiness and Love. Narciso Rodriguez says that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This family shows this many times in this memoir, they always had people over, like the landloard's daughter Alegria who was Narciso's first friend and babysitter she went over to eat dinner very often. Narciso also States that ""also at the table were sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would know my ""real"" grandparents, Narciso the Elder and @PERSON2, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" @CAPS1 also always has many of his aunts, uncles, and cousins for dinner, and ""countless extended family members came and went"" But @CAPS1 says @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family"" which explains why the house was full of happiness but I think the house was full of love because ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."""	3	3		3

He gives a in depth and warm description of his life in @LOCATION1 and the relationships he made. He also spends some time talking about the selflessness of his parents and what they do to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this new place.The author sets the mood that makes people wanna read this if they are feeling sad and they just want to get a warm, cozy feeling from it. I think the mood in this gives off a sence of being selfless, but also coming together when all are segregated and form unity. When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen. The authors says this in his memoir: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place.If we do as they do, we can all live in unity."	3	2		2

""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2) ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is.

4251	5	"Narciso Rodriguez created a caring and greatful mood throughout the memoir. He did this @CAPS1 never premoting himself, but always thanking his parents and talking about his childhood in a way where everybody helped eachother. Fer example in @CAPS2 @NUM1, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made to give their children a better life. He states, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 writing about the hardships and sacrifices others (in his case his parents) had to go through and make in order for his life to be better, Narciso Rodriguez shows apretiation towards them, which then gives the reader a sense of gratefulness. Also, in @CAPS2 @NUM2, he describes how his neighborhood was like a family. He stated, ""Growing up in the environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In an neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This @CAPS2 gave me a sense of how in times of struggle, people will come together and help each other push through. So it gives the reader a sense of caringness. Narciso Rodriguez produce a mood of caringness and greatfulness throughout his memoir."	3	4		4																					
4252	5	"There are many moods that the author creates in the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of our lives. Some moods it creats are sad, brave, and thankfull. The author creats a sad mood in many ways. One way he creats a sad mood in the article is in paragraph @NUM1, he talks about how imigrants leave their families, friends and carrer, just to come to @LOCATION1 to do good and to lead your children in a good place. In paragraph @NUM2, he also says he will always be greatful to his @CAPS1. Leaving your freinds and families behind is a brave action.He also creates a sad mood when he says that all imigrants come selflessly to this country to give their children a better life. The author is showing that he knows how immigrants come to @LOCATION1. He also creates a sad mood by never talking about the good things."	2	2		2																					
4255	5	"The mood in this selection is prode and happy. I know this from some clues in the text. the first and biggest clue is when the auther states some facts like ""and for wich I am eternaly ""greatful"" and ""witch I adore to this day. Also when she says that ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" it shows how prouud she is."	2	2		2																					
4256	5	"From the memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of gratitude and love. The author's gratitude is to his parents for their cultural and selflessness for leaving their family and friends so their kids could have a better life. one line that really showed this was ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1). That line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage. He loves his Cuban family with all their traditions. I'm aware of this because of a line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez is constantly creating a mood of gratitude and love in his memoir."	2	2		2																					
4258	5	In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a reflective and relaxed mood about his memories. For example, his use of parentheses create a voice for him through which the reader can better understand what he is trying to say. Also, by reflecting positiely on old times, it feels as if the author is right here next to the reader, having a pleasant conversation. For example, when he is talking about his landlord's daughter, @LOCATION1, he mentions how she would often grace his table with her presence.Furthermore, by describing the enviroment of his apartment, it feels to the reader most as if we are sitting in a wood backed chair listening to the sweet saranade of an unamed Cuban singer. The smell of spices lingers in the air, The smoke from a stove waters the eye's as it drifts lazily out the window. The sound of engines and the beep of horns created by the low roar of a bus plays in the backround. The bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the furniture burn pleasantly in the eyes. This reflective and relaxed mood is so important for the author to get his stories across, and Narciso Rodriguez does it well.	1	1		1																					
4259	5	The mood that author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because this is proud of his culture. He loves his parents and loves that house that they turned into a home. The author exsplains how his life begain in new jersey and how proud of his parents he was and that he looks up to them and plans on carryinging out the culture and triditions that his family had so that's what makes me think that the mood of that the author sets was happiness and fullness of this familys life, and as I read this passage I was glad and happy for him that he admires his family that much and how happy his life was.	2	3		3																					
4260	5	"The mood created in the memoir could be of happiness, gratefulness and love. The author describes in the memoir how his parents left their country Cuba to give their children a better life even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they love (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The author express gratefulness by saying his grateful for his culture and the sacrifice his parents did (@CAPS1 @NUM2). To conclude the author also express his feelings about the house he use to live, you learn the real definition of ""family"", he is really happy about the welcomes his parents use to do when other refugees arrival to this country. At the end the author says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM3)."	3	3		3																					
4262	5	I think that the mood of this excerpt is caring. The parents wouldn't have (pretty much) given their lives away to start new and give their children a better place to live. They had a perfectly good life back at home but gave it all away for their children. That is why the mood of this excerpt is caring.	1	1		1																					
4263	5	The parent oF Narciso are immigrant they live to Cuba, parents created our traditional Cuban home, It's to hard to live the parent to cuba, this is the great Family to support this in this country the immigrant to live one place, but the imigrant have your own culture in this country iF you are cuban you have you own culture.	0	1		1																					
4265	5	The mood in this article is happy and grateful. I think it's happy because Narciso tells you how much fun he has with his parents and close family, and how much Narciso likes living where she lives. I think its grateful because Narciso got the education that he wanted and everyone around him was so proud of Narciso. I feel like the mood is mostely happy and grateful	1	1		1																					
4266	5	"Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon."	2	2		2																					
4272	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir was about family. He describes how it was when he was growing up in New Jersey. He talk's about ""Sergio and Edelmira"" who were his grandparents ""his real grandparents he did not see until 1970. Even though alot of the people around him were not his real family he consider them to be because they cared and love him. That's what I think the mood in the memoir is."	1	1		1																					
4273	5	"The mood created by the memoir created by the author @PERSON1 is that he is a clothing designer that is internationally recognized by the world and he offered his definition of ""family"". It is a heart warming story about him and what he calls his one and only ""family""."	1	1		1																					
4274	5	I think the mood created by the author was to show everyone that Narciso is grateful to live where he does. He loves his home, his parents everyone gets along. even know he's an imarant he wants to succedy and get along with everyone.	1	1		1																					
4275	5	"The, mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is very @CAPS1 and happy. In paragraph @NUM1 nothing really happens so there is no real feeling. About half way through the @NUM2 paragraph was when the memoir started to get very @CAPS1. It is really @CAPS1 because you realize that he can turn a New Jersey apartment into a traditional Cuban home. It says in paragraph @NUM3 that they are neighborhood was made up of, ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and there was segregation."" It is really @CAPS2 that those cultures could be in a friendly neighborhood during those times. In paragraphs @NUM4 and @DATE1 when Narciso Rodriguez starts to thank his parents it feels as if you were inside that house and your having dinner with their family. Overall, the memoir about turning a New Jersey three-room apartment into a traditional Cuban home was a very @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 story throughout the entire memoir."	2	3		3																					
4276	5	The mood of the author of the story is happy and sad. Happy because he is so grateful to have had parents like he did/does and sad because all of his childhood wasn't great but having a family made it happy and it made it seem more like a home and where his family should be	1	1		1																					
4279	5	"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez From, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives,"" by the auther is all about love and happiness. The memoir is mostly about family and childhood memories. It expresses the authors feelings or love, @CAPS1 the reader feels it to. The author didn't have many material things growing up, or a big house, but there was great memories of love and warmth.The many different memories in the this memoir gave a mood of love and happiness. First of all, it says in paragraph @NUM1, ""... All of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author lived in a neighborhood with many different cultures, but they put their backgrounds aside and were able to great friends. Also, the memoir says in paragraph @NUM2, ""My parents always their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" This shows that their family was very inviting. They were always having guests, and loved a lot of people and considered them family. The author also says in paragraph @NUM3, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1, the author didn't have a big home but the memories, and environment his parents created ***** what he really remembers.In conclusion, from reading this memoir, you can really feel the loving mood from all of the authors amazing childhood memories, to his great home environment. The author really did a great job of creating a mood of love, and helping the reader feel it."	3	4		4																					
4280	5	The mood created by the author is a happy and grateful one. The memoir expresses a positive mood and their are no signs, at all, of negativity throughout the memoir. The author created a mood that tells the reader that he does not regret anything from his childhood and he's grateful for his wonderful and caring parents. The author created a mood that also tells the reader that he is proud of his Cuban heritage and everything and everyone that he has grown up around. Narciso has also made a mood of strong feelings toward his beloved parents, friends, and family. The mood of this memoir is positive and can be described in great meaning.	2	1		2																					
4282	5	"In the memoir written by @PERSON1 the author created a mood, that shines throughout the story. The mood represents the hapiness in @LOCATION3's life when he lived in a three room apartment Newark, New Jersey. In paragraph two, the author talks about how his parents used their heritage of Cuba and brought it to their new home in the United States. @PERSON1 was always greatful how his whole house was revolved around the kitchen. There was always Cuban music and the smell of a Cuban fiest in the air. @PERSON1 was always happy because he was always a part of a family. Through out the tough times @PERSON1's parents went through there was never a shortage of love or the feeling of family. In paragraph six, the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" When the author says this, it creates a happy mood, and it flows through out the memoir. Also in paragraph seven he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This memoir shows that the importance of family and friends creates a positive feeling in anyone's life."	3	3		3																					
4284	5	"Inthe memoir the author the mood the author sets is a thankful soft one The author is thanking his parents in a good way, in a nice, soft, and appreciative way. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house with a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always fills the air with not just scent and music but life and love (pg. @NUM1). All you need in life is a little imagination and a lot a help and love. This guy in the memoir got a lot of help in love by describing it in a nice calm way, of thanking his parents for all they have done for him."	2	1		2																					
4285	5	"The mood that is created by the author is joy. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parent's are immigrants who works hard. They could've stayed in their own country but they wanted a better future for Narciso. When Narciso realized that he felt happy and filled with joy. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents."" When you're grateful you feel happyness. This is the mood that I think this author created."	2	2		2																					
4290	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happiness and gratitude.                                                            The mood was created from the words, and the way the auther described his home and his appreciation of what his parents did for him. @CAPS2 was born into a simple house in a blonde-brick building situated in the @CAPS1 section of Newark, New Jersey. The auther said, ""Within it's walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" @CAPS2 explained that his parents both shared cooking duties and passed on their culinary skills and love of cooking down to him. ""passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.""                                                            The auther also explained how everyone in the community helped each other and treated each other like family. Even though his parents had no knowledge of the language or culture, they immigrated to make a better life for their children. They left everything behind them. Struggling financially and personally. @CAPS2 was eternally grateful for what they did.                                                                                                                                                                     In conclusion, the mood created by the auther was happiness of love and gratitude. ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love."	4	3		4																					
4292	5	I think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood. I think this because throughout the entire memoir the author didn't talk about one unhappy thing. In paragraph @NUM1 the author talks about how his parents taught him how to cook and how they gave him a love for passionate Cuban music. In paragraph @NUM2 the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph @NUM3. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @NUM4.      As you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and I think that is what gives it such a happy mood.	3	3		3																					
4295	5	The mood created by the author was very interesting. At some points the author was very serious. He would tell about the hard times his family had and what they went through. Then he would be joy ful. He would explain what his house would be like. He would tell how joy ful his house was and how he loves his parents so much. He would explain what loving parents he had. He showed how his family wasn't blood related at all. His family was different cultures all combined to make one happy family.	1	2		1																					
4296	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude and happiness. Narciso repeatedly states how grateful he is to his parents for showing him what it really means to be a family and having selflessness and caring. He says, ""In reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" When he is recollecting memories from his childhood he shows how there was a lot of happiness in their home. He says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" With his memoir, Narciso creates a great mood filled with gratitude, happiness, and a sense of childhood."	3	2		3																					
4298	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. Narciso is remembering all the great times he had in his house. His parents are very friendly and welcoming and treat everyone like family. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language or the culture."" This is what happiness really is. Narciso and his whole family have such a great attitude and just want to be friends with everyone. "	2	2		2																					
4299	5	The mood of the story is different throughout the memoir. During the the parts were he talks about the struggles to get from Cuba to @LOCATION1 the mood is sad depessing. But the mood is different when he talks about how his family sometime gets to gether for dinner when they throw a Cuban party for the relitives who arrived to @LOCATION1 from Cuba.	1	1		1																					
4300	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The blueprints of our lives."" I belive the author Narciso Rodriguez, demostraigted the mood of being laidback very acticulatly.This memoir dose not soud very formal due to the fact Narciso does little things like adding parenthenthese with aditoal statments for exsample in paragraph @NUM1. And taking about his friends and family so openly.Thats why I @PERSON1's memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blue prints of our lives."" @CAPS1 the mood of being laid back."	0	1		1																					
4306	5	When reading this memoir it makes you feel something. The feeling you feel is a sort of sorrow. When you feel this it makes you think why did they have to live that way. It also shows that you care for the people Who deal with that lifestyle, @CAPS1 for goodness sake be nice to people dont be nasty because what you do could affect you too.	1	0		1																					
4308	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is joyfull and grateful. The author is joyfull because in stanza two Narciso states ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that the childhood of this person was joyful with the culture, family, friends, foods, and smells. This person is very grateful for all of the things he parents did. Such as when the author states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could've ever done. I thank them repeatedly.

(paragraf @NUM1) This gives a sence that for him home was the safest and happiest place for him to be. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open the the many people we considered family.""

In addition he describes how even though his neighborhood shared different cultural backgrounds, they still lived together as a family.

This is a happy setting where the author grew up in. The author was also very grateful to his parents.

4344	5	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is hopeful, heart lifting, caring, grateful, lively, loving, and courageous. It's hopeful because Narciso's parents had to start their lives all over with any jobs they could find and they wouldn't have made it without hope. They had hope in their children when they came to @LOCATION1 to have great and prosperous lives. It's also heart lifting because it was about how their parents came to @LOCATION1 for their kids and they ended up successful in life and became someone. Having people for dinner, housing others in need, and always ready for more to come who fell down in their lives and need some comfort shows as much care as a parent is to their newborn. Narciso's parents showed him what family, and friends are and to have courage and persevere. He is very grateful of his parents for these important lessons of life: They didn't just tell him, they showed him through their lives which makes it much more effective. They always had life in their home because of the music and aromas in the air and all of the people that came for dinner or to stay for a short time. His parents must have had courage to throw away their life's work, come to @LOCATION1 for better lives for their children, and to start a new career.

What he is saying is that you don't have to be related to be family. Anyone close enough can be considered family. He also felt that you should always help people in need.

Another reason I think that the mood of the @CAPS3 is @CAPS1 because in the story the @CAPS3 @CAPS6 ""I will never forget new my parents turned his Simple house into a home I think this means that the @CAPS3 is @CAPS8 and that is the mood I believe the article is about."	1	2		2

This also shows the mood in this memore is love, love of cooking of music and of family. Another place were it showed love in the memore was in this quote.

Here, Rodriguez is talking about how she never meat @CAPS2 real grandparents until they left Cuba in 1970. This is important  because early in the memoir she said @CAPS2 surrogate grandparents (Sergio, Edelmira) came to eat dinner. In conclusion,  in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by @CAPS2 is shocking, @CAPS2 real grandparents come to @ORGANIZATION1 in 1970.

4365	5	This memoir gives me a sort of cozy and comfortable feeling. When it talks about a family being not only people that are blood-related to you I think of my friends and the people I can count on. They are my family too. He also talks about how a house is not necessarily a home, not without memories, your family, and something or someone that you trust. Lastly, he tells us about how greatful he is that his parents brought him to a neighborhood that he would soon learn to love.

But however the strongest feeling is unity, and family.I'm Not sure family can be called an emotion, but it is I think something that can be described by several. One of course is unity, or as he says it, ""great solidarity and friendship""it's rather sweet how he charectorizes family as something as the bonds you make withe people in contrast to other cultures where family is from blood ties and family s always first. So in a way I think his way of thinking comes from his culture.But also he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. As they say ""happiness is nothing without appreciating it"" and as he says ""I learned the real defnetion of family"" so apparently he knows real happiness"	3	2		3

4394	5	"In my opinion the mood is created by the auther in the memoir by the setting and describing her child hood, where she was born and why her parents came here. The reason I think this is because the mood can create this setting, because the mood is the feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, lonely, silent and that is what creates the setting which is where, when, and time of the story. Some examples from the excerpt are, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey."" Also, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative.""

To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" I could @CAPS1 feel the prid in that because he is talking about how his parents left every thing basicly for him. Also, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to who ever needed help even though they were the richest people either. He gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir, pride"	3	2		3

The emotions used to create the mood include passion, unity, and gratitude.The mood of this memoir has lots of passion. Narciso talks about his family's passion for their Cuban heritage, and how they shared it with him. That was a big component of turning that house into a home, and therefore, part of the mood that Rodriguez wanted to represent. ""... my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... love of cooking... passionate Cuban music..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM1). I also could feel a sense of unity the author was trying to portray. "".. the congregation of family and friends..."" The author mentions several times his parents and him were always letting distant relatives stay at the house, and many friends and family came and shared dinner with them. The author even describes his community as a ""... a close-knit community..."" (Rodriguez, @NUM2). Lastly, a sense of gratitude runs along the spine of this piece. The author notes his parents were a huge part of his life, exposing his to his culture, family and friends, and they home. He doesn't even have to write how grateful he is, it is so evident. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" (Rodriguez, @NUM3).The author created a mood filled with passion, unity, and gratitude.

The author show that no matter if your rich or poor, you can still have a closely knit family.	2	2		2																					
4403	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir would be describe happy and thankful. I say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless.

He said (in paragraph @NUM1) that growing up in his environment istilled a great sence of family. His family welcomed other refugees from cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country. Thanks to what he grew up in he learned the real definition of family.The last mood I feel the author created was he was grateful.

There are many things said in the memoir that express the mood of love. For example in paragraph two the author talks about the simple apartment that him and his parents lived in as a great place. He does this because he is so thankful to his parents because he loves them. The paragraph says, ""and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 not be a grateful about simple things like cooking, but the Narciso loves his parents so much that he is extremely happy for even the little things they did for him. Instead of calling Sergio and Edelmira the neighbors who lived below us, they are called surrogate grandparents. This shows that they were very loved by Narciso. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""Countless extended family members came and went and there was often someone staying with us temporarily."" This expresses the mood of love because again the neighbors are called family. Also, Narciso's parents allowed them to live with them because they love them and cared deeply about them. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso sees what his parents did with their lives as an amazing thing because he loves them so much. When this memoir is read the mood of love is expressed."	4	4		4

Their family were happy, they partied, and as said in paragraph @NUM1, they ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family.""

4411	5	"In the story I just read, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I think that the mood that the author gives would be passionate, greatful, and happy.The reason why I think the author is passionate because he talks about how a home isn't just a roof over your head, its where your heart is. ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open for the many people they concider family."" I think that is passionate because in order to do those things you have to be really caring and lovable.I think that the author shows greatfulness because he says that he always thanks his parents for the sacrifices to give him a better life in @LOCATION1. Even though he says it many times, it just isnt good enough to prove how gratful he is. His parents changed a three bedroom apartment into a place he now calls home and that is what he is greatful for.I think that Narciso is happy that he had gotten a chance to spend his child hood lif growing up in @LOCATION1, but still take on the cultural tredition of Cuba. He is now a fashion designer.All in all that are all the three moods that I think Narciso gives in the story."	4	3		4

I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	3	2		3																					
4413	5	"The author does an excellent job for creating many moods in this memoir. One of the moods, is love. Love is a mood in this memoir because @PERSON1's parents took ten people who needed somewhere to stay, because they know that those people would do the same thing for them. Another example of love is when @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM1, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" The memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have, which, is another mood. It does this by having the author point out how little his house was, and how his parents did everything they could to give them a better life. It really makes one look back, and see how much their parents have done for them."	2	3		3																					
4415	5	"The mood would be loving and carring. When @CAPS1 was a child growing up in @LOCATION2, his parents treasrd familey and friends. They taught him to always lend a helping and and to alway keep his door open. ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was maid up of mostly spanish, cuban, and italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States."" It was a close knit comunity and everybody knew everybody. Nobody was a stranger. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us"". His parent's instilled How important familey is and friends."	3	3		3																					
4416	5	The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir is Very necessary. I say this because I don't like any writing that doesn't have @CAPS1 swings. this author does a good job of showing the emotions of Narciso Rodriguez in their story. A place in the story where I really like the @CAPS1 swing is between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @NUM2. I like this change because, it goes from talking about a landlord and his daughter to talking about @ORGANIZATION2's parents. I like that because, it creates a mode of @NUM3 different backgrounds on the two different @CAPS3 of People. It talks about how @PERSON1's Parents were imigrants and weren't raised well buts they wanted their son to have a better childhood life than them. On the other hand, the landlord and his daughter @LOCATION1 , were rich and Could do anything they wanted. I am just blown away by how this author changes his moods.	1	0		1																					
4417	5	"In the memoir 'Narciso Rodriguez' the mood of it was happy and was meant to sorta touch someone. In his memoir he explains something he found fun and amusing that he still does today ""a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore today)"". ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in friendship"" this shows the neighborhood he lived him was happy and united. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language of the culture. They came selflessly"" this shows that he wanted the readers to know how caring and loving his parents were."	2	3		3																					
4421	5	"The mood that the author gives through out this hole artical or, memoir is happiness and family. All during the memoir he speaks of how he cherished his family. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" the author keeps on saying how much he is thank ful to his parents and how he loves how they were able to give him all they had to offer. That is what he ment when he said he couldn never show how much it means to him. The mood in the memoir is love, family and happiness."	2	2		2																					
4423	5	"By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort. The mood created in this story shows how family should be. When @PERSON1 says that ""they take anyone in until they are back on their feet"", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. These three parts set the ""mood of the story."	3	3		3																					
4424	5	The mood is good and happy. In this artical the mood is peaceful and positive. It's a secsesful mood also great-full because @PERSON1 is greatful for everything.	1	1		1																					
4426	5	The mood created by this @CAPS1 is, It makes the reader think About his family And what they have sacrificed for you.

4429	5	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is a loving one Rodriguez is looking back at all the great memories of himself and his ""family"" when @CAPS2 was young.When living in new @CAPS1 as a child, Rodriguez lived in a very loving home, and a very loving neighborhood. Rodriguez refers to the people living in his neighborhood as family, claiming ""... 'Family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" @CAPS2 always had neibors an friends over which @CAPS2 considered to be ""family."" The was alot of love in his neibors, and so @CAPS2 grew up with a lot of love around him. But, of course, @CAPS2 loves his parents the most.In this memoir Rodriguez is thanking his parents for being so selfless and loving him so much throuout his childhood. Rodriguez is looking back on how great of a childhood @CAPS2 had, living in a great loving neiborhood, with parents that love him alot.Narciso explains the true definition of family in this memoir, and thanks his parents for loving him as much as they did."	2	2		2																					
4433	5	I believe the mood of the memoir is happy and enlightening. I think this because @CAPS1 someone imagrate from a certain country of poverty or unjust laws this community or neighborhood will take you in. this community is made up of Cuban spanyards and italians all have left there homelands to persue a better life for either them, the family, for there kids In conclusion the mood of this memoir is happy because it is enlightening and welcome place to be.	1	2		2																					
4435	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a family mood. Rodriguez talks about how family always visits. The memoir states ""countless extended family members came and went..."" (paragraph @NUM1). He also explains that family isn't always the people related to you. Rodriguez says that his neighborhood ""came together in great solidarity..."" (paragraph @NUM1). Rodriguez says that he is most grateful for his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Narciso Rodriguez really creates a mood filled with love, caring, and family."	3	3		3																					
4437	5	In the memoir the author sets up a happy mood while remembering his child hood home. He only recounts good things and happy memories in the entire memoir. He also speak of cherished childhood memorys and how good his cummunity was and parents.	2	1		2																					
4438	5	The mood in the story is very happy. The author is thinking about all the good times he had growing up. He is talking about how he had such a good life in the house. How his parents came there as immigrants and made a life for themselves and then him. Another reason he has a happy mood is because he talks about his family coming to @LOCATION1. He talks about how his parents taught him how to cook. He thanked his parents because he was so happy they created a family not just a home.	2	2		2																					
4440	5	"In the memoir the author creates many moods with in it. In the text the first mood he created was caring because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows caring because they would let anyone that was family and wouldn't care. The next mood he showed is being grateful because in paragraph @NUM2 he says"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"". This is him showing that he is grateful because he says it in the sentence and he also tells the reason why he is grateful to them. These are the moods the memoir created."	3	3		3																					
4441	5	I think in my opion is that the author was very comfortable with his words and his way of being human. His parents was originally from cuba, @CAPS1 was in to there culture nice to other in there surrounding. For an example @CAPS2 say It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the country and where I celebrated His first birthday.	1	1		1																					
4445	5	In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he named the music that was playing and all the family that ate with them. Narciso also talked about them cooking. I think the moods peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. he only says the good things about them. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house.	2	1		2																					
4447	5	Narciso @PERSON1 so proud he was Cuban immigrante and how his parent did so much for him. he realized that (in paragraphy @NUM1) family had nothing to do with being blood relative. And How all culture just came together as great solidarity and friendship doubt to when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in United @ORGANIZATION1. He learned the true meaning of family. How his parent turn a regluar house into home that he loved. He was grateful how his parent made so many sacrifice that turn something into life time expenence that he will never forget. He was happy how little thing turn it great memories, that he can't wait to tell the world.	2	3		3																					
4448	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is one of happiness, safety, and care. Narciso had parents who loved him and a very close-knit community. All the descriptions of his family cooking and family neighbors eating together is enough to make anyone feel happy. Throughout the memoir, Narciso emphasizes the care of his parents. You know Narciso's parents loved him as of his attitude toward them. In paragraph @NUM1, when he writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" shows his parents' care for him. When the author writes, ""In our neighborhood,... all these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" These two sentences give the reader feelings of safety and once again emphasize care. This memoir by Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood of happiness, safety, and care."	3	4		4																					
4451	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a sort of grateful, appreciative mood. Throughout the memoir, Narciso repeats how grateful he is to have such courageous parents. For example in the first few sentences of paragraph @NUM1, ""My mother and father come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind thier families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""  this shows how grateful he is for his parents, to do all this, just to give him a better life. I would feel just as grateful For my parents if they had done this for myself, just as how Narciso felt."	2	2		2																					
4452	5	"The mood created by the auther in the memoir are love, happyness, and @CAPS1. Love is one of the moods because they welcome people in need ""My parents always Kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, Knowing they would do the same for us. Happieness is one of the mood because Narciso is pleased with parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and secrifice."".  @CAPS1 is one of the moods because all every one in the neighbor hood got along. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship.""."	3	3		3																					
4457	5	The mood of the author in the memoir are grateful and thankful. Narciso life seem original like others would have. It was a simple house they started, turned to a warmth home. Narciso appreciated his parents brought them to this land, Cuba, selflessly care for their children for a better life. Although they is struggling but they are have happiness. His parents often welcome neighbors and relatives to join the dining. family to him that he be learned is not just his parents, sisters and brothers. It's neighbor surround you and treat you with respect like a family. This is how Narciso Rodriguez felt of worthy to have a home like that. He felt grateful and thankful for his parents love and sacrifice. He admired for his parents strength and perseverance. He'll never forget the gracious neighborhood brought him memories and his parents turned this simple house into a home.	2	2		2																					
4459	5	The mood in this story @PERSON1. Moving can be hard for some people others it is an @CAPS1. Most people hate to leave their @CAPS2, work, and friends behind. Other people it's a new oppertunitie to meet new people a better job, or go to a better @CAPS2 for your education. I understand it is hard to move from cuba to the united States. Thats across the world not a town over or a street down. But he made a friend and his mom and dad love him very much. They always have food on the table so at lest they dont starve. It was a step down moving to united States going from a good jobs to poopy. The mood in this story is very loving between the family and all there friends	1	1		1																					
4460	5	The author in the memoir mood was happiness because they bought a New house in New Jersey. They had a born baby in the house her @CAPS1 is Narciso she @NUM1 years old. There family is happy. There parents are from cuba. They live in a beautiful house that has @NUM2 bedrooms.  In hous There, familys are always happy.	2	1		2																					
4462	5	I think the mood was happy @CAPS2 the @CAPS1 talk about a @PERSON2 named narciso Rodriguez and that he lived in Cuba and he's parents moved to the United States so the family could Be together and I think that the @CAPS1's mood is happy @CAPS2 this story was great a talk about a @CAPS3 and his parents moving to the United States.	1	1		1																					
4463	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and warm. This is shown in two ways: the selflessness of the parents and the true meaning of family. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, is forever grateful to his parents for starting their lives over so he could live a good life in @LOCATION1 This is shown in paragraph @NUM1 when he explains that his parents loved Cuba but left so their children could have a better life in @LOCATION1. He gives his thanks to his parents in paragraph @NUM2. This feeling of gratefulness contributes to the warm, happy feel of the piece.      Throughout the piece Narciso explains to us the true meaning of family ""'... family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative,"" he states in paragraph @NUM3. In paragraph @NUM4, he explains that family means those who care for and about you and stick by you no matter what. This feeling of family definitely helps to make the piece feel warm and happy."	3	3		3																					
4464	5	"I think the mood is suppost to be sad for many reasons. One reason is that he keeps saying how his house isnt a home untill the end. Such as ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Another reason is that his friends and family is all he got. Such as ""...how important family and friends are. Also because he had to move, so he didnt no anybody. Such as ""...Originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."	1	2		2																					
4465	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and inviting. The auther made it feel as. if I was really there in his neighbrhood. the auther took the things most people take for grantit and elaberated on them. he made the mood feel real he made the reader that they were a part of the story.	1	1		1																					
4468	5	"The mood in this memoir is very moving and heart-felt.

My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" @CAPS1 can just tell by this quote how much of an impact Narciso Rodriguez's parents had on his life. It also explains how crafted his parents were and how intelligent they were. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @PERSON2 most deffinatly loved his family. "	3	2		3																					
4469	5	Though out this story there is a certain @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. like how these people got there dream home and this was it. How there Parents Came to this country not knowing the language or have a good edication but Still becoming succesful and living in this house. Where these people learned to love. and the best part having family near by.	2	1		2																					
4470	5	"Based on the memoir, the mood created by the author is one of friendliness, thankfulness, and caring. In paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2, the author says that, ""all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 also says, ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" These quotes @CAPS2 that friendliness and helpfulness to the people around you considered family is a big part of their lives and the author trys to convey this sense or mood to the reader. The mood is thankful because @CAPS1 is appreciating all that his parents have done for him. In paragraphs @NUM3 and @DATE1, the author mentions being grateful of the cooking Skills passed onto him and ""to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" The feel the author creates of his ""admiration"" for his parents leaving their native country, comes through in the mood. Lastly, The mood is one of caring and welcome to friends and neighbors they considered family. In paragraph @NUM2, the memoir States that ""Alegria"" and the author's ""surrogate grandparents"", ""graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not."" These quotes @CAPS2 the openess and caring feeling in the home and family created by the mood of the story.

As it States in paragraph @NUM2. This article is fille d with love and respect for family and friends, that is what the atheur was saying."	2	1		2																					
4473	5	"The author of the memoir is thankful of her parents and to the rest of her family. I know the author is thankful for his parents because in paragraph @NUM1, the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, freinds, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 reason why I think she is thankful for her parents is because they made their liFes worse to make the authors life better. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""In the united states, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever they could find."" The last reason why I know is because he basicly says it in the last sentence of paragraph @NUM3. It says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. That is the authors mood in this memoir."	3	3		3																					
4474	5	In the memoir narciso rodriguez by The blueprints of our Lives The mood the author created in the memoir was grateful the author created that mood because he was and is still grateful abought how his parents left behind their family and friends and Jobs so that he can have a better life also the mood is grateful because they passed on their rich culinary skills to him. Also he is grateful for livving in a simple house with all those wonderful neighbors and freinds. I think the mood created by the author is grateful because this is a memoir of all the good things in his life and all of the stuff he should be gratefull for having.	2	2		2																					
4476	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. For one, the mood is of graciousness for all that was done for Narciso Rodriguez. In the memoir it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""  This feeling of graciousness tells about the love and sacrifice he feels his parents went through for him. The memoir also shows this mood of graciousness for the understandings his parents taught him. In the memoir it says, ""Growing up in this envronment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This understanding that was taught to him had a large impact on his life at that time. The final express of graciousness in the memoir is his feelings toward the passions his parents taught him. In the memoir it says, ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally thankful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". These express the passions and skills that followed the author to adult hood, holding a special place in his heart. These are the descriptions of the mood that is created by the author in the memoir. "	4	4		4																					
4477	5	"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir was courage, and perseverance. First, Narciso Rodriguez's parents traveled to the United States with absolutely nothing; they had no money or background information about the @PERSON2 In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso states, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" Narciso's parents would bravely step into a new world where they didn't know anyone, they couldn't communicate with anyone, and they didn't really have any ideas as to what was going on. The Rodriguez's also persevered through the @CAPS1 challenges of racism and segregation, here in this country. In paragraph @NUM2, he states, ""at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed..."" @CAPS1, Narciso's parents had to get through problems with people, and they also had to fight through the mental challenges, due to racism. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that his parents were always ""braving the harsh winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" His parents had the courage to persevere through new weather and financial struggles. The overall moods that Narciso Rodriguez created for me were bravery and perseverance."	3	4		4																					
4480	5	"A sense of community, selflessness, and contentment washes over Narciso Rodriguez's memoir of his first home. Happiness was prevalent over this story, described through a ""love of cooking"", ""endless celebrations"", and ""friendship"". Readers can imagine the scenes depicted, happy gatherings around a table laden with aromatic food, and parties with people, young and old, tall and short, of all different cultures. The words that weave this well-written memoir are nothing if not content.Community is also emphasized in this written work. ""A close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants"", their neighborhood was described as. The memory of many souls working together despite radical racism in that time really gives the memoir a communal sense. Narciso Rodriguez says, ""My parents always kept their arms and the door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.""When the sacrifices that his parents made were outlined in the memoir, selflessness truly becomes a mood in the memoir. A whole new life embraced just so that their children could have a better life, his parents rarely did things for their own benefit. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" Narciso Rodriguez says. The endless struggles they endured, and the many times they could have given op, they didn't, because they wanted, so selflessly, to give Narciso a better life. This memoir's mood holds three important things: a love of community, happiness, and selflessness."	4	4		4																					
4481	5	the mood created in the memoir were all different. they talk about there family, friend, and how they turned a apartment into a place called home. they talk about there cultures and wat they do for fun with friends, and family. He also talked about sad moments and happy moments he didnt get to know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba in paragraph @NUM1.	1	1		1																					
4483	5	"While reading Narciso Rodriguez I felt a certain mood. the mood was very serious and grateful. In the memoir Narciso said, ""I will always be thankful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this shows he is thankful for all his parents Did to make him the man he is today. He also writes, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" That statement is a serious thought that clearly came from the heart. It shows he has love for anyone who comes close to him. to add, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage."" that says that he thinks about his parents and having heart, and courage, and that is both serousness and gratefulness. In closing I would like to say Narciso Rodriguez is a very grateful and serious man."	3	2		3																					
4484	5	The mood created by the auther is that of the american dream. It is a very happy and successfull theme with roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants that hopefully had simallar stories. In each paragraph there lines that have relation With freind being family and how his home was phisically quant but emotionally it was a place of love. That enhances the mood of happines in the story. Also the fact that in the story racism and segration were set aside and neighbors were relatives because of who they were not were they came from. That is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that. lastly the story tells times how the parents sacrifice for their sons better life. That has probably touched most of reader close to hom so the mood would now becom very serious. This short memoir is a great story to bring you mood from sad to hopefull and thankfull that you live in a place you can call home.	3	3		3																					
4486	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one. A reason why I think this is by talking about how he and his neighbors (of different descent) All got along very well in solidarity with one another which creates a sense of love. Also when he talks about happy times like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen they are having a good time, laughing, and listening to Cuban Music. Lastly when he and his family take in family or even just really close friends who they consider family conveys a true sense of happiness, peace, and love.	2	2		2																					
4487	5	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" is compassion. Throughout the memoir it talks about how Narciso was grateful to his parents for their ""love and sacrifice"". He was grateful that they wanted to move to the United States from Cuba just to ensure that he would have a better life. He learned generosity and how important family and friends are from his parents and they have been ""the basis"" of his life. His house welcomed everyone and the air was always filled with ""not just scent and music but life and love. He learned what family really ment and learned how to love. He loved his parents a lot and talked highly of them in his memoir ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love... The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" That is why I think that the mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" is compassion."	4	3		4																					
4488	5	"The @CAPS1 of this memoir creates a mood that is very touching and meaningful. It shows the hardships his family had to overcome as well as the good that came frome it all. The @CAPS1 states in his memoir, that, although his family was going through tough times, they left their door wide open to family that needed help and always had the thought of others in their mind. He explains how hard it was for his parents to leave their home and jobs in cuba, but that they did it for him, so he would get to live a better life. one more thing the @CAPS1 said in the memoir that was very touching was when he said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me..."" These words show us how much of an impact his parents action had on him and how they helped him in life. These are some examples of how the @CAPS1 describes the mood."	3	3		3

4492	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the story has more of a  ""happy"" or ""joyful"" mood.  I chose those moods because one, it showed how peaceful and loving everyone was even if they weren't family, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Two, he said how happy he was for his unselfish parents, ""I was always greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more couragous thing than I could have ever done"". Finally, he explains how different everyone was, and yet can get along with each other so well, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" In conclusion, this is the mood I think the author created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez."	3	4		4																					
4494	5	"The mood created by the author is very greatfull and thankful. The author shows how greatful and thankful they are in this memoir When they said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their Strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me With their lives, and those teachings have been the base of my life.""- In my conclusion this is why I think the authors mood in the story is very thankful and greatful."	2	2		2																					
4495	5	"There are many ways to describe the mood in ""Home: The @CAPS1 prints of Our Lives"", by Narciso Rodriguez. First, the mood is family-friendly. This is because in paragraph @NUM1, the author states ""the innocence of child hood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, forms the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Also, the mood is very joy ful. In paragraph @NUM2, the author states, ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS2, the mood of this memoir is defining the love of his family. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" These have been some moods in this story."	2	2		2																					
4497	5	I think the mood of author in the memoir is thankful, proud and happy. @PERSON1 is extremely thankful of what is has, disspite what has happened through his life. He is proud of his Cuban heritage and is still proud of it today. He listens to Cuban Music and cooks Cuban food. Also his is happy. In the memoir he has a very happy tone because is his proud and thankful. His parents were immigrants from Cuba and he still got the education he wanted, even though his parents went through tough times.	2	2		2																					
4499	5	The mood of this story is happy. I think this because in the memoir it talks about cuban fiests, being with family, and friends and it seems like its a good time. Also I think this because it talks about good memories wich is always a happy thing. And it's all celebrations and being together wich is always a good thing.	2	1		2																					
4502	5	"Narciso was very grateful of his parents they had love, happiness, depression and maybe more. The author's memoir was sad, but also a loving memoir. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" Narciso loved his parents for making a simple house into a traditional Cuban home. He also loved how his parents made their own home. ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such corage, they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" Narciso  was so grateful he thank his parent every day that created love. ""It was this simple house that my parents celebrate my first birthday"". He kept the house as a memoir to remind himself of how he came to america. it was loving, caring, and also cheerful."	3	3		3																					
4503	5	"The author of the story creates a mood to help really emphasize the point of his story. Narciso Rodriguez explains how his parents immigrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1 and try to find new jobs and start new lives. Rodriguez also explains how he learned to call his neighbors family as the Italian, Cuban, and Spanish cultures ""came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1, he tells of how the door was always open and their newfound family was always a seated around the table. Rodriguez really does a fantastic job of creating a pleasant mood in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
4507	5	The mood in the memoir swifts throughout the story.  First is that in the begin Narciso wasn't sure he would like moving to @LOCATION1 because it was so different.  But that changed when they started having family over and also using there imagination to decorte there house.  Next is that the mood change in the middle of the memoir when they rellized you can have just a good life in @LOCATION1 then you can anywhere else.  Also, by them having there family with them while in @LOCATION1 made there moods more positive.  Lastly the family's mood was negitive when having to move to @LOCATION1, but once they were there and made there house into a home there mood change immeditly and they were happy in @LOCATION2.  Thats the mood created by the author in the memoir.	1	2		2																					
4508	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific mood. He talks about family, love, and home. For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing. In his neighborhood, Narciso says that ""cultures came together"" and that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love."" I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too."	2	3		3																					
4511	5	"In the memoir, by Narciso Rodriguez, a distinct mood of family and caring is set. The first way this mood is set is by the the passionate Cuban music and the home cooked meals. Rodriguez writes, ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (p. @NUM1). This quote exentuates the mood of family because the music and food of thier nationality gives a feeling of comfort. The comfort with you family and to the mood of family. Another way the mood of family is portrayed is the size of the house. Rodriguez writes,""... I was born in this simple house situated in a two family, blonde-brick building..."" (p. @NUM2). This adds to the mood of family because living in a small house means that a lot of the time will be spent with family. This also adds a cozy feel to the environment. Finaly, the mood of family is contributed to by how close their family lives. Rodriguez writes, ""My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria and Rosemary also live nearby"" (p. @NUM2). Family living nearby contributes to the mood of family because it exentuntes the number of family members which exentuates the mood of family. Based on the memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, a strong mood of family is expressed."	3	4		4																					
4513	5	The author of this memoir creates a very calm mood. This article isn't anywhat exciting at all. All it is doing is explaining this child's life. This memoir, to me, was like taking a list of things and putting them into a full paper. The author did not create any kind of mood that interested me to keep reading of this topic. This memoir did however express a lot of feelings though. It expressed how grateful this kid was for his parents and his Cuban descent. Although this memoir had a calm (and slightly boring) mood, the author's ability to reveal information was very deep and insightful.	1	2		2																					
4514	5	"one mood of this memoir was that of a traditional Cuban home. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM1, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" A second mood of this memoir was the impression of a Cuban family who faced my hardships. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM2 ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" The last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about: love, loyalty and friendship. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM3 ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	3	3		3																					
4516	5	"The mood of the @CAPS1 is happy. In the memior, Narciso Rodriguez describes the happy and fun times of living in her small home in New Jersey. He describes how his family, which consisted of her mother and father turned their @CAPS2 house into a cuban home and opened the doors to other refugees that were going through difficult times. In the last @CAPS4 Narciso explains that this is the home where all her first birthdays happened, and where her friends and family would gather. The message the @CAPS1 was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be. The reason I know the @CAPS3 mood was happy is because, she had wonderful people in her life. Her home wasn't big and fancy but as described in @CAPS4 @NUM1 ""It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees."" In this @CAPS5 he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love. Narciso's once simple house had turned into a home, filled with friends and family."	3	3		3																					
4517	5	"In the memoir I think the mood the author creates is love for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a ""blood"" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family!"	2	3		3																					
4518	5	"In the memoir, the mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez is welcoming and cheerful. One example that describes this is from paragraph @NUM1. This is where he described his neighborhood, saying ""In our neighberhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 this he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from, they always welcomed each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, the author says that his parents came to @LOCATION1 selflessly, to let their child have a better life even though they were leaving their home country. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memorice of his home, where he had birthdays, parties, and family. He said that there was the scent of life and love in the air. For this he is forever grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of ""family."""	3	3		3																					
4519	5	The mood of the memoir is nostalgic and happiness. He tells the readers about his econimic backgrounds. He also explains about his family and what they meant to him. then, he talks about his house and about how he had he had his birthday there. Those are some examples on how they create the mood.	1	2		2																					
4520	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he is proud of his family, their background, and the way he grew up. In the memoir, it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso loves his parents and the way they raised him."	1	2		2																					
4521	5	The mood in this story is very happy. In this answer I will show how he created it.Firstly, the author always had a good mood no matter what happened or what his parents didn't do. He had great memories of the kitchen smelling good. He also loved his Cuban music.Secondly, he showed how thankful he was towards his family for bringing him into this world and caring for them.These two things show how Narciso Rodriguez made this a happy passage to read.	3	2		3																					
4525	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of gratefulness and happiness. The memoir show a pasionate explination of how Narciso Rodriguez's parents Came to the land of @LOCATION1. It shows how happy he is that he can live in @LOCATION1, and lead his own life. He is, and will always be, eternally grateful that his parents brought him here, so he could have a better life. His gratefulness also affects how his parents raised him, as a Cuban. Any mood could have been described here, but, as it states in the memoir, he is grateful for his family.	3	2		3																					
4529	5	In the story Narciso Rodriguez the person telling the story is @CAPS1 grateful to to parents for moving so thay could have a better life. The people that were around them were like their Family evan though thay went blood @CAPS2. The Parents wernt selfish, and thay helped if people need help and let people stay if thay needed a place to stay. The parents moved to make a better life for their Family evan iF it ment Leaving every thing behind.	3	2		3																					
4530	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is caring, and loving. The author explains, throughout the memoir, how his Parents were caring and loved to help others. He says that his parents ""always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family"". He explains how his parents had left their great jobs, friends, and family in cuba, so that their children would have a better life. The author says that his parents helped him discover the real meaning of family."	2	2		2																					
4531	5	So the mood of this memoir is @CAPS1, Struggle or not so good and @CAPS2. In the @CAPS3 it telling you all about His parent and alot more about His parent's. Next is talk about Being born in a simple house and that way @CAPS1 mood there to. So @CAPS4 the end of the memoire @CAPS5 startes to talk about the @CAPS6 things like not Be able to find the kind or jod they deserved and that not that much @CAPS6 thing @CAPS5 talk But But in the end @CAPS5 @CAPS10 the definition of @CAPS11 and that mood is alsome. Then @CAPS5 learne there about love in the simple house and to never forgot how my Parents turned the simple house to a home. So the mood is a mix of @CAPS1, @CAPS6 time's and the alsomeness and more.	2	2		2																					
4532	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that they feel more responcible to help support themself more than anyone else dose as growing up From the young to older, and have been living off their own from being away from your families. I think the mood of the auther is that they feel good about themself and happy to have a better life from the past until now and learn more about themself as they're mood becomes happy and joyful about themself for ""having a better life."" "	1	2		2																					
4534	5	The mood the author created in the memoir was happy and joyful. The author explains were he lived as a child very vividly. from the air mixed with the aromas of cuban food to to cuban music the author still loves today. It seems like he had a good childhood. He says his parent were selfless and took in refugees in their home. It gives this story a warm feel like it could almost be your mom or dad. He make the story very personal with all the family members he explains. His parent, did the very best they could for their family. That is how the mood is set.	2	2		2																					
4536	5	"I think the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is that he is proud and grateful. One way he shows he is grateful is by telling the readers how his parents sacrificed themselves to give him a better life. He says: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Which shows that in addition to being grateful to them for sacrificing themselves, he is grateful for all the love and care they gave to him as he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez shows he is proud by saying ""my Mother and father had come to this country with such courage� I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"". This shows Narciso Rodriguez is proud to have parents that are strong and brave and willing to leave ""behind their families, friends, and careers, and the country they loved"" all for him. So I hope you now see how Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates a mood that reflects how he is proud of and grateful to his parents."	4	2		3																					
4537	5	"The mood that was crea ted by the author was love, and inspiration The mood was love because throughout the whole story he told his parents that he loved them and was proud of them. he feels proud of them because of all they do for him and the family. So he is proud of them. he is also greatful to have parents like this because they do so much for him they cook, clean, and keep a roof over his head and keep him protected. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration this mood is created because of what he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perservirence. this means that he is proud of his parents and he is thankful for what they do for him, he says tha he is thankful for all they have sacrificed. These are some examples of the mood that was created."	3	3		3																					
4538	5	The mood created by the author is love and @CAPS1. Because the author talks about how growing up was. The author helps babysitting. And the author sounds like a nice person. thats what the author's mood is.	1	1		1																					
4540	5	the first paragraph was kind happy because they came to the @CAPS1.S.A and that after living for a year was happy. I 1961 he was born they were living in the Simple house, situated in two family blond-bricks building in the Ironbound section of, @LOCATION1 was onhappy because they parents shares same kitchens.	1	1		1																					
4542	5	The mood the author creeted is gratefulness. @CAPS1 is grateful for many things @CAPS1's grateful for culinary skills and love of cooking that was passed on from her parents. @CAPS1 is grateful of her close-knit community, who are honest hard working immigrants who always extend a helping hand. But the big reason @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS2 her family. @CAPS1 is grateful for her countless family & extended family who joine them for meals and who stay with them temporarily. @CAPS1 is also mostly grateful for her parents. @CAPS1 is grateful that her parents are @CAPS3 nice and always keep there arms & door open for help knowing they'll do the same. @CAPS1 is also majorly grateful for their courage to come to a new world without knowing any of the language or culture just to give their children a better life. @CAPS1 is grateful her parents had to make a huge sacrifice just for her benefit to leave behind there friends, family & careers in the country they love. @CAPS1 is also grateful for both the personally & financial struggle her parents had to go through and braving the harsh northern winters. For her culinary, love of food, family, and parent sacrifices @CAPS1 will be forever grateful.	3	2		3																					
4544	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author was powerful. It had made one feel as though you were accualy there. The author had explained in detail his living enviornment of a small house in a community of other immigreants like them selvs who had band to geather in rough times. During the memoir the author tells about his cuban background, ""Passionate Cuban Music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 also tells about @CAPS1's deffinition of family. the ones in his community that wernt just blood related but the neighbors who looked after each other. The author sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community. and how his simple three room apartment has become a home."	3	3		3																					
4548	5	"The mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family. This family moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 with no clue what to expect, no prior knowledge of the culture or anything else. All they had was eachother which gives off a great sense of family. Then there is the happiness factor, throughout the story no matter what the sircumstances they seem to be happy because they had family. In the story it says that ""my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy."	2	3		3																					
4549	5	"The mood in the memoir changes. But overall the mood is sad. It tells how Narciso's parents give up what they had for the better of their children. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Also, most of Narciso's family did not have homes for a while which is sad because they do not have a place to call home."" Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" Narciso's parents gave up everything for him to have a better life. They left the place they were most @CAPS1 in for him. ""The faith that is struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."""	2	3		3																					
4552	5	"In this memoir the author creates a mood which- for me, sucked me into this memoir. I think Narciso Rodriguez created a ""home sweet home"" mood. I say this because when he says, ""within it walls, my young parents created our tradition cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" it reminds me of my family and how my family loves cooking puerto @CAPS1 food. The smell is like, ""your home"". In my home everyone's execpted and even if you're not realated. Narciso also says this in his memoir. also.Narciso is very grateful in his memoir because his parents immigrated to have a better life. this creates a loving and family mood. Narciso says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many thing I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Now that they've immigrated Narciso Rodriguez will never forget his childhood home. There are many moods in this memoir."	3	2		3																					
4556	5	The mood created by the author, in my opinion, is a happy mood. It is happy because the author gives the reader a great explanation and description of his life at home. The author created a happy mood also because it showed that his parents were not selfish and that they wanted their children to have a better life in the United States. They had left their whole family behind. Also, Narciso talks about how he and the rest of the immigrants had to deal with racism. But, they were still happy and determined to be, so they all work together happily and in unity. I think it shows that the author not only had family in a nice house, but in the neighborhood as well. The story gave me a sense of a really good, close-knit family. Including the importance of one.	2	2		2																					
4559	5	"The author created several different moods in this memoir. The main mood that the author was trying to creat was thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says,"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows thankfulness because she's saying thank you to her parents and everything they have done for her. Also, she is thankful because she started to realize how hard her mom and dad had to work for the house and put food on the table. The main mood of the story is clearly thankfulness."	2	2		2																					
4562	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir. First, the mood created by the author is that he love to cook, his parents taugh him how and her is eternally gratefull for his parents.

They always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love.In summary, this are the mood created by the author."	2	3		3																					
4564	5	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" he demenstrates a mood of love. @ORGANIZATION1 shows his love by telling his parents. In the @NUM1 paragraph he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" Here he shows his compassion for his parents because his parents left cuba and went to @LOCATION1 to start a new life. Also, they wanted a better education for their children so they left family, friends, everything behind so they could restart their life. Another way how Narciso shows love to his parent is by using what his parents did to him into his life. Narciso used the better education, to have a better life. Now he is a fashion designer. Therefore, in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", he shows a mood of love in the memoir."	2	2		2																					
4567	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir. The mood that the author was happiness. When example of happiness was that his parents passed on their culinary skills and a love of cooking.

4573	5	The mood created in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez is a grateful, cheery tone.

Also, as in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, he talks very highly of his parents, how they made their house a home, and how grateful he is to have them as parents. The mood makes me think of the color yellow, and of the sun, happiness and warmth. Narciso Rodriguez did a great job setting this cheery mood in his memoir.	2	2		2

4577	5	"I think the mood the author set is loving. The story says how there was a love for cooking and a passion for Cuban music. Just how endless celebrations brought life in there warm home. Narciso Rodriguez also had a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, although these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" How there parents always had their arms and door open to many people knowing they would do the same for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

This happens for example when Narciso states: ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows how he is greatful his parents taught him how to cook, which he still does today.

4589	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author depicts a mood with distinct traits. One trait of the mood is selflessnes and courage. It is shown in paragraph @NUM1 when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it ment leaving behind their families, freinds, and careers in the country they love."" Would you be able to throw away your life, into an alien world, just so that your children would have a better future? Doing this would take lots of selflessnes and courage. Also, the mood has gratefulness. The author shows this in paragraph @NUM2 when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows the author's gratefulness towards his parents for their selflessness and courage for coming over to @LOCATION2 to give him a better future. Finally, unity is found in the mood. It is found in paragraph @NUM3 when it says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs else where, all of these cultures come together in great solidarity and freindship. It was a close- knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""

I think this because when the memoir said that he had plenty of relatives around, and freinds that probably made him feel comfortable. Also his parents were very welcoming and kind so you would probably feel comfortable because of that too. That is what I think the mood of the memoir is and why.	2	1		2

4659	5	"The memoir Narciso Rodriguez by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, enholds a mood of happiness and warmth, which is described in several ways. Happiness serves as an apt description of the mood in the story, due to the narrator's constant reference to a joyful essence which fills her apartment house. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" This represents how happiness transpires throughout their home, and how everybody can feel free to be whoever they want to be. Consequently, Narciso's house is a warm, happy environment. Another example which describes the mood in the memoir is how Narciso explains how there is always a friend or family member in the house. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote, spoken by Narciso, further explains how growing up surrounded by love and laughter and warmth, creates a positive influence that remains instilled in a person forever. This reflects how the mood of the story is happiness as well. Finally, a last example which concludes how the mood is described within the memoir is how the author illustrates the admiration that Narciso feels for his parents. He describes how these are the words to show his gratefulness toward his parents, and how he admires them both for leaving their hometown to raise a family. This contributes to how the mood of happiness exists among the memoirs content, and furthermore describes the mood that was created by the author."	3	4		4

4748	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a loving mood. I think he creates a loving mood as opposed to something else because of the way he describes and explains things. For example, when he is describing his parents cooking. ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". The phrases in parenthesis portrait to me a loving mood. Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community and his parents sacrifice is shown by these next to quotes ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"", ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially,"". The detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving mood for  all the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir."	3	3		3

4756	5	"Narciso Rodriguez sent a very loving and inviting mood to his memoir. He wrote about his great home and family. He showed how happy everyone was to be together and nothing went wrong. Narciso tells how his parents sacrificed everything in Cuba for him. The whole neighbor was tight-knit and loved each other. Family was defiantly a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing. His home was a ""traditional Cuban home"". By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home"". Narciso sets a loving mood with his great family and home memories."	3	2		3																					
4757	5	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez. The mood of the reading could be described as grateful. I can sense this mood by some of the things Narciso Rodriguez mentions. The author would constantly say ""thank you"" to his parents for all the sacarfies they had to mak for a suitable living enviroment for Narciso. It also states that ""there was no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Over all, in the memoir of @PERSON1 the mood can be mainly described as Grateful towards his parents, heritage and home."	2	2		2

4763	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from the book Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author tries to create a mood that complements his opinion on the definition of family. Narciso Rodriguez was born to Cuban immigrants in a busy area of New Jersey filled with people of all nationalities. It was this melting pot of people and his parents hard work that shaped who he is today.                                                                                                     The main mood that is generated throughout the passage is a positive mood, exemplified best by how the author himself positively talks about the great impact his parents had on him. Narciso realizes the sacrifices and the the hard work his parents had to endure to provide for him, of which Narciso writes ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, with no knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents were not selfish at all and took a huge endeavor by going for the United States. However, through their hard work, determination, and couage they established themselves in @LOCATION3. It is this positive, happy outcome that makes the mood so bright and positive. In Narciso's home, as he writes, ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop of life in our warm home."" (paragraph @NUM2) The use of the word ""warm"" creates the bright vibrant mood associated with his home. The idea of warmth is repeated later in the passage where the author writes ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the the air with not just scent but life and love"" (paragraph @NUM3) The repetition in describing the warmth of the house once again establishes the positive mood.                  Narciso lived in a neighborhood filled with all kinds of people. However, despite their differences they came together as a friendly, united community, of which the author write: ""Despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (paragraph @NUM4) Despite the overt racism at the time, this community still came together and were there for each other no matter what. This unity with in the community definetely distills a happy mood within the reader. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very positive mood throughout the memoir."	4	4		4																					
4765	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very luring, like you read one sentence, then you want to read more. In the story, she says how her parent have to start their lives all over again. But, then she says that they're just happy to be together in good old @LOCATION1. Just because you have very little, doesn't mean you can't live it out the fullest. Be happy with what you got or don't have anything at all is what this story is telling me in my mind. So I will follow my life to the best like Narciso and her family did.	1	1		1																					
4771	5	They were sad through some of this memoir. The first reason why they were sad was that they left there familys. They also had to leave the country of Cuba. And left their friends to. They were also happy too. The reason why is because it is a Spanish, Cuban, and @CAPS1 comunity. So they feel like they are at home.    They were made because they would half to start there life over. They would have to find new jobs and transportation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	1	1		1																					
4772	5	The mood created by the author was a happy and exciting mood. This is because the family was so excited about moving to a new place with better oppertunities and educational purposes. It also changed a regular house into a special home for them because they had people over and over and over which finally became family. The neighbors also helped create the mood by not creating any negative action or violence in the author put the family's location in a non-american neighborhood.	2	2		2																					
4775	5	The mood of the memoir is that he is growing up in the house with his Mother and father. His parents giving a hand to people who Need help. One explaination is when his parents moved here and left all of their friends & family in hopes to make a better life for him. Another is showing him about his culture threw music, cooking, celebrations and taking care of other people. His parents let people stay at their home when they Need to get on their feet. And by always having people over for dinner (Aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, @CAPS1 etc...).	1	2		2																					
4777	5	"The ather creats mood in the memoir in soe ways. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" His is an example because it is sayin That in some environments everyone is your family. In @NUM2 the author says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifices."" This is an example because he appreciates everything that his parents did for him and he  always will too. That is how the author creates a mood"	2	3		3																					
4778	5	"The author showed his mood very clearly in the memoir. The way he worded things such as ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home"" Showed how happy he was toward his parents. He told us how greatful he was for his parents being so selfless and thinking about him first. He also makes it clear how he is proud and how he greatly respects his parents for the great things they did to improve his life. Also he shows how he admires his parents hard work and bravery for the things they have done. In conclusinon, His overal mood I think is his gratatude toward his parents."	2	2		2																					
4779	5	The author was in a respectful mood. In the memoir it tells a lot about how his parents took care of him and about his life and how his parents heped him through it. So when the author wrote this he was in a somewhat happy mood because he looked back on all the good times but that can also make you sad too.	1	1		1																					
4780	5	Narciso Rodriguez describes his life in the hardships and selflessness of his humble and caring parents. The moods created by this author is happy and lighthearted, inspired by his love, and gratefullness. Narciso views his parents as saviors, who sacrificed everything to provide a better life to their children. He is eternally grateful for their courageus acts that brought him incredible oppurtunities in @LOCATION1. He looks back happily at the warm and comfortable atmosphire of his home. He is greatful for his Cuban heritage that his family instilled in him at a young age. The unity of his close knit community taught him honesty, and the importance of hardwork.Narciso exudes love and a sense of pride in his incredible and hospitable family through his writing. Setting a mood a gratefulness a true admiration for parents who taught him important life lessons he will never forget.	2	3		3																					
4785	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir would be grateful and happy. It really makes you wanna think about life and how good it is, thanks to parents and grandparent, even anchestors. It makes you want to love your parents even more seeing how they went through alot and probably gave up alot for you. Like leaving their homeland or giving up great things like @ORGANIZATION1 and Narciso Rodriguez Sr did for their family or son. They wanted a better life and education for their kids. They had to leave their homeland, where they were born and raised and give up some things to get better things. They had to give up their job and skill's they already knew how to do for better things. The good thing that happened or that they get is more freedom and better life and education, it's not easy leaving everything you love and where you are born but has to be done for better things and opportunities. Reading this memoir gives you or leaves you with a satisfying, grateful, happy and kinda sad mood.	3	3		3																					
4786	5	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is comforting. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the Kitchen."" @CAPS1 a sense of home, spending time with the ones you love.

4787	5	The mood that was created by the @CAPS1 is that no matter if your an immigrate or not one you could make friends and have family that you love still with you and could make some friends. Another mood that he talks about is tha his parents and how they love to cook together and are selflessness too.	1	1		1																					
4788	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is happy and warm. This is because of the strong and caring relationships talked about in the memoir.

In the story he talks about being aroud ""family"" people who arent blood realative; just that can make a person happier @CAPS2 the memoir make the reader happier because the author is writing about happy memories he'll never forget. Although it was simple the author put a lot of deep emotions that were portrayed in the story, which made the story has a deeper mood."	2	2		2																					
4789	5	The mood in this memior is happiness because she was so happy that his parents have moved to a bigger apartment then they previously had. She was happy that the landlords daughter was nice and always set the table for them. Sometimes his aunt and cousins would go over and eat at the table as well.

Lastly the author was thankful because his parents gave up their lives in cuba to make his better	1	2		2																					
4794	5	"This excerpt called ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a light, happy mood. I say this because throughout the whole story, he is describing all the good things about his parents and his household during his childhood. A few examples are in paragraph @NUM1, where Rodriguez states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"". When he says this, it gives the reader a good feel of how his parents cared for anyone who needed their help. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he says this, it is another time he is telling us he is grateful for his family. Throughout the whole excerpt, Rodriguez lists many times he was happy and grateful for everything his parents have done for him, which sets a positive mood."	3	3		3																					
4796	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, shows an specific mood. The mood from this is happieness and satisfaction. The family is happy because they got a new home, they have a child, and they made pretty good friends from the nabiorhood. The satisfaction part is in there too when they are satisfiyed with what they got like, a job, a home, family, friends, and they are makeing money. After all moods depend on your surroundings, like the people not the merchendise. And thats all that matters."	2	2		2																					
4797	5	"By reading the memoir I know that a Family @CAPS1't Just a Family because they are blood relative a family is about loving eachothor and always being there for eachother The author is greatfull For everything his parents have doneFor example in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will alway be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."""	1	2		2																					
4798	5	"The mood in This memoir is @CAPS1. Narciso Rodriguez is from a Cuban born and raised childhood he values everything they ever did for him.As stated in @CAPS2 @NUM1 of this passage he ""is eternally @CAPS3 for all that his family done wheather it was The @CAPS4 Cuban food they cooked him or weather it was the Cuban music They made him listen to. Growing up in a multiracial community made him accustomed to being a non segregated individual. The mood he sets when narrating this is @CAPS1 because, not once did he ever take life for granted.""I will always be greatfull for what my parents showed within love and sacrifice, @CAPS6 ofen told them for what they have done was more couragoas Than i could have ever reached""."	3	2		3																					
4799	5	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez's mood was a loving, caring, thoughtful feeling which came from his childhood home. In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""A cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This quote shows how much love and caring the mood is and makes the mood a more loveing and thoughtful feeling In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about to love."" In This quote I felt the mood which was love and the @CAPS1 inquires it with his word choice. Also in this passage ""Narciso Rodriguez"" it states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote signify's all three moods loving, caring, and the thoughtfulness of the memoir. It describes how the mood was brought on, how it was and the meanings. The mood to the story is touching with all the warmth of love brought into the house, instead of caring about the possessions with greed."	4	3		4																					
4800	5	"the mood created by the author in the memoir is how he was living with his family in the house.     the specific revelant in the story is said ""the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friend and endless celebration,"". and what he want to show how he was living with many people and he is a immigrate"	2	1		2																					
4806	5	"I think that the mood created by the speaker is gratitude. I think this @CAPS1 his parents ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This shows that he appreciates his parents passing on their cooking skills. Another example when Narciso is thankful ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 they gave up their jobs of working in a laboratory and chemical engineering to make his life better. This shows that the speaker was creating a tone of gratefulness"	2	2		2																					
4809	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir feels like that of simplicity and home. He talks of the music and smells of his house, giving the feel that one is actually there sensing everything. He describes his home in such a relaxed way, and how the people in his neighborhood were also good to eachother. It gives the empression that his life was like a relaxed dream where everything is right. He talks of all his relatives that live nearby, and being a child I feel a somewhat comforted sensation from that very part. He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had moved for their children to @LOCATION1 where they would have to take lesser paying work. Sacrifices like those make me feel as if there is pure love left in the world, I only wish my parents cared like that. Though this story proves the love of two parents to their children, and that alone makes me feel a sense of peaceful closure.	2	3		3																					
4811	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is loving. An example of where this mood is shown is this quote from the memoir, ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" The author is talking about how everybody in his neighborhood acted as one large family, even though people were of very different nationalities. It shows that the author had a very loving community and remembers this time as a time of love and brotherhood. Another example is when the author states ""...I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote shows the love he feels for his parents, his house and all the residents in the neighborhood. A third and final example of the loving mood within the memoir is when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows that he loves his parents for giving him oppurtunities, even when it @MONTH1 have cost them something they loved. The author created a loving mood in the memoir because that was how he remembered his childhood; Filled with love."	4	4		4																					
4814	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. @PERSON1 is greatul for many reasons. Some things he is greatful for is his parents his home his culture and his family. I say this because he mentioned these topics alot in the memoir. One reason he is greatful is for his parents culinary skills, As said in the memoir ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still in me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"".  Another reason @ORGANIZATION1 is greatful is for the love his parents give him because without his parents love and sacrifice he wouldn't have the courage he has. I know this because in the memoir @PERSON1 said ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"". The next reason @PERSON1 is greatful for his family because they are always there for him that is the reason his parents always keeps the door open to family. @PERSON1 is greatful for life and love. It was there when he learned the real definition of family, and this is why he would never forget the place he called home."	4	3		4																					
4817	5	"Memoirs have a certain mood that the author usually works around with. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the author explains his family in a very @CAPS1 way. The author talks about his love of cooking, how his parents want to give their children a better life by moving to @LOCATION1 leaving loved ones behind, and the author @CAPS1 his house.The kitchen was the very heart of the home to the author. His parents was very skilled in cooking, which passed onto their children. The author says on paragraph @NUM1, ""� A love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author's love for culinary skills. Next, is how the author's parents love their children. They didn't know anything about @LOCATION1, but moved there just to give a better life for their children. The parents had to leave their loved families, friends, and country. For example, on paragraph @NUM2, it explains what the parents had to. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows the parents realy loved their children wanted them to be happy. Finnaly, the last sentence of the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" states how the narator feels love for his parents and his home. This all shows that the narrator is happy with his family in pleased of where he lives. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is @CAPS1 . The author shows this by @CAPS1 the culinary art his parents, and his home.  He is grateful for what he has, and has love for his family and home."	4	4		4																					
4818	5	The mood of the memoir I believe to be grateful or enspioring. Narciso's parents are imigrants from Cuba who live in a rasict community and are working to be able to support there kids. They are great parents to Narciso and provide him with basic nacessidies. They feed him, and buy him clothes. Narciso is very kind and thankful for the trouble his mother and father go through and he is also very considerate to try to help them when they need it. The mood is grateful because that is how Narciso feels toworrds his parents.	2	1		2																					
4819	5	"Throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic. While I was reading it I was very interested in what Narciso had to say next. It seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's @CAPS1. From his speech in this story I can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes ""But, In reality There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me."" @CAPS2 reader, there you have it. Those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the set!"	3	3		3																					
4820	5	"The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, talks a lot about home and how you can find family were your not expecting too.He sets the mood in the memoir, that portrays love, warmth, and happyness. The overall mood of the memoir is loveing. Like how Narciso says in paragraph @NUM1, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about love.""When Narciso was growing up he learned that ""... Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" All the cultures in his neighborhood came together in unity and Friendship. So Narciso Rodriguez wants to create a warm, loving, @CAPS1 mood to his memoir, just like he experienced growing up!"	2	3		3																					
4821	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is greatfulness. The memoir showed how greatful Narciso's was to his parents. Their bravery and selflessness must have truley impacted his life then and probaly how he lives today. It also give the feeling of respect. In this memoir it shows how much he truley respected his parents and community. And last I think it gives the mood of admiration. The memoir really expressed how much he admired his parents and community. It showed how much he admired his parents bravery and he admired his overcoming of odds. He also admired how a community of different races could get over that and pull toghether to really make a community.Those are some of the moods that ar expressed in this memoir.	2	2		2																					
4823	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is generosity. Narciso Rodriguez, the author, talks about how much generosity his parents had. He says, ""My parents always kept their arm and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" In the memoir Narciso says that he will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. His dad worked in a laboratory in Cuba and his mom had studied chemical engineering in Cuba. In the @CAPS1.S they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. He says that this house was where I learned the real definition of family. He also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS2 @CAPS3 parents were generous, grateful, brave and had courage. We should all be grateful for what aour parents sacrifice for us or had sacrificed."	3	4		4																					
4825	5	"The author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And Narciso's case his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love."" Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home"". By showing the selflessness of his parents the author is able to create a connection to a time in the readers life where someone showed this sort of mood towards them creating a perfect mood to enjoy the reading."	2	3		3																					
4830	5	"In the excerpt, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Narciso Rodriguez's Home: The @CAPS1 print of our Lives, the author creates a very warm, kind of theme by painting a picture in the reader's mind of a family long ago, that lived in unity and supported each other, pulling through in the very end. The author mentions several things from which one can infer the sensation of a strong supportive family that has everything it needs. As the author tells us, ""In 1961� @NUM1 � family, blond � brick building� created our traditional Cuban home� very heart� kitchen� rich culinary skills and a love of cooking� Passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen� innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends� endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (� @NUM1). This quote comes across with not just @CAPS2 meaning, but with a feeling that's hard to obtain � like when you're sitting around a campfire with friends and/or family. This feeling is created by the author's language, displaying a masterpiece to the reader. Language like ""very heart"" and ""warm house"" is what really conveys it. In conclusion, the author uses language appealing to a readers sense of safety, warmth, and unity to create a warm theme in his memoir."	2	3		3

This quote shows that he loved how his parents loved him, and made sacrifices for him, and he will always be grateful to them. He also says that he now knows the true definition of family. A quote proving this is ""... Family had nothing to do with a blood relative."" This quote shows that even if people aren't blood-related, they are still family. Narciso Rodriguez says that his parents welcomed anyone with open arms. A quote proving this is ""it was in this house where my parents welcomed other refugees..."" This quote shows how loving his family was. Family really is a strong bond that will last forever."	4	4		4																					
4839	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez from: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author creates the mood of family and love in the memoir. @PERSON1 was a boy he lived with his parents in a three-room apartment. The heart of the house was the kitchen and that was where his parents taught him to cook and showed him the passionate Cuban music In the house, ""...the innocence of childhood the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both formed the backdrop to life in our warm home (@NUM1). Then, @PERSON1 realized that "" 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" (@NUM2), which showed that a neighborhood made up of Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants could get along. Many people had lived at the Rodriguez house, even if they weren't blood related. Some people were the landlord and his daughter, who lived upstairs, while the grandparents lived in the basement. Anyone in the neighborhood was welcome to stay and they would usually stay in the house because they had an economic/money problem, @CAPS1 the Rodriguez family let people stay until they could get back on their feet @CAPS1, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, knowing that they would do the same for us"" (@NUM3). ""It was in this simple house... where I learned the real definition of ""family."" And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" (@NUM4)."	4	4		4

He is happy he has this family and he is happy that he has the simple house he was born in. There are a few choices the mood could be The one that the author has written about is happiness. He grew up where he had friends or family to have someone that they trust. He also had his land lord and first friend that helped grace their kitchen table for meals. His parents opened the door for family members, knowing that others would do the same. He thinks his parents are brave that they would have  courage to come to @LOCATION1, knowing that they would leave everything behind. He is most happy about how he learned about the real meaning of ""family""."	2	3		3																					
4843	5	The mood of the author i think is caring; but then I also think it's calm. I think it is caring because of the way he talks about the neighbor-hood. I also think it's caring because he understood what was going on. But I think it is calm because the way the way that he speaks it's in a calm tone.	2	2		2																					
4846	5	In the excerpt, the author creates a loving mood. It mentions that Narciso will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrafice. That's telling us they get along well and really care for eachother. And then there is his siblings that live in different parts of the apartment. They help set the table and eat with them so I can tell they are all really loving and caring and all enjoy being a family together. This why I believe the author is creating a loving, and peaceful mood.	2	2		2																					
4847	5	"In  ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 the author creates a mood.

Paragraph @NUM1 says ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees celebrate their arrival to this country""... This shows that no matter how diverse people were. the author's family always accepted them and their differences. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, and knowing they would do the same for us.""

To show about a family and how a family would take care for you and what not to explain what lifestyle makes someone feel great to make the feel safe and not live in a life where it will just wither away from you.

The mood is happy and loving."	1	1		1																					
4937	5	"The mood created in this memoir is friendship. One reason is because his parents let the door open for the peope they considered family. A quote that shows this is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors to the many people we consider family.

4939	5	"The mood in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" was loving, caring, warm, and inviting. The loving atmosphere was created by how much the family really did love each other. The family also loved their Cuban culture. The mood was also caring and friendly. The familes from all different countries cared for one another. I felt that all the people were warm and inviting. Everyone felt that they could trust each other and have each other over for dinner. The Rodriguez family really brought their culture to their new home and Narciso mentioned in the last paragraph that this is where he found out the definition for family while living in this neighborhood. The mood was created very clearly by the author in this memoir."	3	2		3																					
4940	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is peaceful and loving. Narciso really believes that the definition of home is relationships & love rather than furniture and expenses. His home sounds really great because the way it is described in the memoir, you can see that his family are very caring and selfless people. The fact that his parents take in strangers and allow them to stay at their home really shows that they are very caring people.	2	2		2																					
4942	5	"The author's mood is very grateful and happy. The author's parents were originally from Cuba, and arrived in the United States in 1956. The author moved into a modest, three- room apartment.

4944	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir. Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing the memoir life was hard. Quite the contrary our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt recism. in their neighborhood despite customs elsewhere all of these cultures came together in great solidary and friendship. Over all these was hard for the author memoir	2	0		1																					
4945	5	In the memoir the author made a certain mood. The mood he made was loving and very alive. He constructed the mood of love in paragraph @NUM1 where he talks about the memories of his house always filled with comforting aroma of food and the passionate cuban music playing.  It also where he talks about how the memory of his home having the congregation of family and friends as the back drop of their warm home. Another example of the mood of love is in paragraph @NUM2 where he talks about how he was always surrounded by love ones during meals. He constructed mood of life in paragraph @NUM2 as well because he talks of how his house always became a sanctuary to his extended family member who lived with them until they got back on their feet. This gives the mood a sense of life because of all the people who have lived there. In conclusion this is the mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir.	3	3		3

In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS2 says @CAPS2 is grateful for his inheritance of the cuban culinary gift. In @CAPS1 @NUM2, by saying ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" @CAPS2 shows his gratitude for his parents moved to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM3 @CAPS2 shows his gratitude for his parents love in the quote ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Rodriguez is also grateful for the love and hapiness of the home. @CAPS2 evidences this in paragraph @NUM4 in the quote, ""it was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music and love. It was here where I learned the definition of family"". @CAPS2 goes on to say, ""I will never forget this house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned about how to love"".

4951	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is that she is very grateful for everything of her parents had done for her and showed her. She is very happy for all the things she has and she admires her parents for their love and sacrifices they took. In this memoir she talks about how her parents came to the United States in 1956 and then had only a one-room apartment with her and her sister. They finally afforded to move into a three-room apartment. She finally called it a home (as she says in the article). She is very thankful for he family and important friends.

Going on to talk about how his parents cared about him for them to come to @LOCATION1 for him, to get and have a good education and a better life. This is something that takes a couragous person to do and a person that loves and cares and wants the best for others. Because family sets of mood and that is love and careness."	2	3		3																					
4954	5	In this passage the mood to me is like relaxing and a soothing gratefulness towards his parents. The tone of his voice is not angry, not happy happy but soothing. Obviously Narciso loves his family and loves @LOCATION1. By the tone of the narrators voice shows that. Coming to @CAPS1 was a great change as he said because you leave behind so many friends, family and the presence of the culture. Family to Narciso is his relatives but culture as well. As you can see the tone of the narrators voice really makes the story interesting.	2	2		2

4960	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy, calm, and kind mood. It is a happy mood because the author only talks about the good things that happened to him and his family. It is a very calm mood because nothing very exciting or nothing very sad happens, everything in the memoir is very calm. The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is also a very kind mood because his parents are very kind. In paragraph @NUM1, ""my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.

4962	5	"Mood was created by the author in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."" The mood that he creates is a happy and proud mood. The author is happy to have had a wonderful family and was proud of what his family accomplished and proud of his home. Also the environment of were he was growing up taught him that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. He sets a happy mood because of how he thinks of his whole community as a family. He was very proud of his mother and father. For example he says ""they came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" And he also says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This is the mood I think that the author created in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4964	5	"Throughout the memoir, a very thankful and happy mood is shown. Narciso was raised in @LOCATION1, and knew why his parents had moved from Cuba, despite their love for the culture and weather.

4965	5	"The author created a reflective, happy, and grateful mood in the memoir. First, the author states in his memoir, ""I was born into this simple house... which I adore to this day... childhood... first friend."" All these phrases show Narciso reflecting to his childhood, his first friend, and first house. Narciso reflects to his past, like how all memoirs should be. Secondly, the author uses words like ""great sense... adore... grateful,"" to show his appreciation and happiness of his childhood. To my knowledge, there aren't any grave, dark, sad parts of his life in the memoir. Finally, the author says that he is grateful for his rich culinary skills, passed down by his family, and his parents' love and sacrifice. This gives the mood of the memoir appreciation throughout the memoir, especially near the end, where he is grateful for his parents' selflessness.

He also appreciates his parents alot because they left cuba to come to the United States so he would have a better life. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""I will always be greatful to my parents love and sacrifice""."	2	2		2																					
4972	5	The mood created by the author is a warm and meaningfull adviroment. They made there house have a Cuban feel to it. They have passionate Cuban music playing, and aromas from the kitchen. Anyone who needs to stay at a place, stays there. His parents moved here and left everything  behind them, friends, family, and jobs. His mom and dad taught him that family and friends are the most important thing in your life. He said he learned the real meaning of family in his house and he says I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.	3	2		3																					
4974	5	The mood of the memoir was heart-warming. The way Narciso Rodriguez wrote the memoir was looking back at his life as half full, not as half empty. Instead of pointing out or remembering the bad things about his childhood, he writes about the good parts of his childhood. For example, his parents gave him oppurtunitys despite their struggle. His parents made their home a happy place to be, even though they were going through times of rasism and segregation. Also because of his parents positive attitude, it made him a positive person. Another reason the mood was heart-warming was now Narciso's parents demonstrated with their lives and teachings how important family and friends are. Narciso's parents have given up and done so much for him, resulting in who Narciso Rodriguez is today, makes this memoir truly heart-warming.	3	3		3

4988	5	In the memoir, @PERSON1, the author creates a mood that inspires us to try our hardest and that mood is perseverence. The mood perseverence is expressed in the memoir in many ways. One way it is a stress is when @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1 moved to the United States and lived in a one bedroom apartment. They finally saved up enough money to be able to move into a @NUM1 bedroom apartment. In this neighborhood the family raise as much money as possible to buy food for themselves and to help the people that were in need of anything from, water, shelter, and clothing.

When the author ends paragraph two with ""life in our warm house"", the reader knows she was pleased with her childhood conditions.

(@CAPS2 in the beginning paragraph @NUM1) That quote sets a mood where a little audience in your head goes ""@CAPS3 I never thought of that way before."" This memoir does not give out blunt moobs like happy or sad, It makes you think. There was never a really sad moment in the whole thing. At the end of paragraph @NUM2 he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This quote is another example of giving a very undefind mood, I say it is undefind because you just cant put it into words of how you feel. So in conclusion the mood this piece gives is undefind."	1	1		1																					
5022	5	"I think that the overall mood of the memoir is a thankful one. Towards the end he says ""I will always grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, he doesn't talk about the bad alot. He only briefly touches on it.

5026	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood is gratefulness. Mood means the overall atmosphere of the authors words. I think that it is happyness, because no matter what happens, Rodriguez is always gratfull. She does not care if she lives in a simple house with a bunch of people, she is happy that she has a home. In paragraph @NUM1, she says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I would have looked up to her, for being this gratfull and happy for what she has. Also, the last sentence she says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" These are a perfect example of the mood, greatfullness, and some of happyness."	2	2		2																					
5027	5	"The mood created by the author was structured around many things. First of all, it is a light, warm, happy mood as the author describes how he grew up in a simple but loving neighborhood. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" It continues to be a friendly, cheerful mood throughout the whole memoir. It grows grateful and thankful, however, as the author describes how ""They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 he sets a mood which fluctuates and changes throughout the memoir. It moves from warm and fuzzy to thankful and back again."	2	2		2																					
5030	5	"I think the mood that the author created was a happy mood and a mood that makes you appreciate what you have. And to always remember where you came from, and to always love family. At some points in the memoir the mood become more about @CAPS1, for example in ""paragraph @NUM1"" he tells how his neighborhood growing up was made up of many races including Spanish, Cuban, and Italian, and he tells how they all came together in solidarity and friendship. He also says how his family was always helping each other.In conclusion, I believe the main mood in this memoir would be @CAPS1 and coming together wether it be as a family, or as people."	2	2		2																					
5031	5	"In this memoir, the author created a proud and glad mood.The author, Narciso Rodriguez, showed how proud he was of his family and home through his memoir. His parents left their home in order to make a better life for him and for that he is extremely proud and grateful. His parents also allowed other immigrants to stay with them temporarily. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""what They did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done.""Narciso shows how glad he was that he got to grow up where he did. He had his parents, as well as all of his neighbors, which he considered his family. Though his apartment wasn't the nicest place to live, it was his home. He was happy there and always had people around him who loved and cared for him. In paragraph @NUM2 he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.Narciso shows his proud and glad feelings through his memoir."	3	3		3																					
5032	5	The mood of the author is @CAPS1 and grateful because his parents left Cuba and were very nice people. They let people live at there house. When the didnt have much money, the took any job the could get so they could care there son, Narciso, they had a three bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate their arrival to this country, they also had there house full of love and life.

Overall the mood created by the author in the story is love.	1	2		2																					
5039	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice and happy. I think the mood is nice and happy because @ORGANIZATION2 shows @CAPS1 for his parents, grandparents, and his house. Another reason I think the mood is happy and nice is because the passage talks about @ORGANIZATION2's hometown, culture, and etc. It also talks about what he is grateful for and that would be his parents, and passionate Cuban music. In conclusion that is what I think the mood is which is nice and happy in the story Narciso Rodriguez.	2	1		2

The lovingness of his parents and open arms in stride left Narciso feeling appreciative. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. Knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 the author's parents overcomed many obstancles faced moving to @LOCATION1 it never stopped them from aiming for success.

They passed on their rich culinary skills and love for Cuban food in the kitchen of a three-room apartment in a two family building. He says that the community was all a different race but they all became a big family that got through the racist times of the United States in the '@NUM1. He says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their extreme love and sacrifice. He reminds them constantly about how grateful he is and that he can't believe how they did it. So the mood in this memoir is about family.	2	2		2																					
5043	5	"In this memoir the mood varies. In paragraphs three and four it was a ""giving"" mood, for example explained in paragraph four ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" It shows right in the sentence that they gave people in need what they needed in difficult times. In paragraphs six and seven the mood was thankful and happy for the sacrifice his parents gave for him. Because of her future.

5048	5	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home; the @CAPS1 of Our Lives"" @CAPS2 Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a warm, pleasant mood. He does this in several ways, one being him writing about how the overcome segregation. He says that ""...Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants... In our neighborhood,...all of these cultures came together in great solidary and friendship."" In this manner, he creates a bright feeling @CAPS2 saying that even when segregation was dominant, everyone in his community was friends. Another way he mixed the story pleasant sounding is how he talks about his parents. Althroughout the excerpt he, talks how greatful he is to his parent: mainly @CAPS3 of how kind and loving they were As he puts it, ""They came selflessly... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS2 giving up their lives, they were able to make others' lives better.

5051	5	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is thankful and @CAPS1. I think that the moods are @CAPS1 and thankful because there are surten parts in the story where it makes him seem like he is @CAPS1 and throughout the story he is just saying thank you to his mother and father. So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir. Also these are my thoughts on the memoir.	1	1		1																					
5052	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very upbeat happy one. This is because he uses the memoir to describ how happy and upbeat his house was as a child. He does this by saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This indicates a happy mood because the son is very happy that his parents love and sacrifice helped pave the road to his future. That is why the memoir has a happy mood."	2	2		2																					
5055	5	"In the memoir, the mood seems to be happy, and grateful. To me it seems as if the author is trying to show his great love and respect for his parents and how they have taught him everything he knows and without them he would be nowhere.     ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice I've often told them that what they did was a much more courages thing thing than I could have ever done."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1)       This shows me that the author's mood is set to be happy and about love and how he is extremley grateful to have them in his life Also it shows his love for what his parents have taught him.     ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed onto me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)     This also shows that the mood is in a happy mood because he is explaining everything great his parents have done for him."	4	3		4																					
5056	5	"     In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, he included many stories about his ""family"" and parents. The stories, along with the parentheses expressing more of his opinion, created three main moods in the memoir. The moods @PERSON2 created were happiness, humor, and kindness.     The mood of happiness is expressed when Narciso is talking about his friends in the community and family. At the table, when at least one of his extended family members joined him regularly, Narciso set a mood that was very happy. During those meals that him and his family had, they would often laugh.     Laughing and humor were another specific mood of Narciso's memoir. In the parentheses, Narciso put a personal touch of his experiences. For example, when talking about 'rich culinary skills', the parentheses said, 'and for which I am eternally grateful.' The extra information had a hint of humor and kindness.     Kindness is the third mood set by Narciso. He had a kind tone when talking about his parents, and how generous and loving they were. He also had a kind tone when talking about the friendship in his community. Friendships like, extending 'hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearily in need'.     In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir there were the tones of happiness, humor, and kindness. All three moods were involved, one way or another, with his most important thing, family."	4	4		4																					
5057	5	The mood by the author by his memory was happy, thankfull, because he sais that his house in New Jersey bring happy memoris like for example his kitchen were his parends shared cooking duties and unwittinegly and the kitchen were he loved to cook. or his neighborhood were all of Spanish cuban and italian immigrants were there customs despid, all of this cultures came together in great solidary. or were his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family. or were he feels grateful with his parents for their love and sacrifice he often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then he could have ever done.. he will never forget How his parents turend that simple house int a Home.. 	3	2		3

I know that because everywere in the article the author talkes about love and happieness. To prove that it says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air not just scent in music but life and love. I know the mood is happieness because there is always positive things in this memoir. Also, with love comes happieness. Thats why I think the mood of this memoir is love and happieness."	1	2		2																					
5065	5	"Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is non-fiction. The mood created by the author is strong because he loves his family for going to america. Love is a strag mood to show. He says in the story ""My parents always Kept their arms and their door open to many people we considered family, Knowing that they would do the same for us.

5067	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the mood author created is thankfulness and gratefulness towards Narciso's parents, family, and friends for making his house a home and also gratefulness toward just his parents because they gave him a better life. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage. without any knowledge of the language or culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 saying this Narciso is expressing thanks and graditude toward his parents. In the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso is clearly stating his gratefulness toward his parents. In the last sentence of the memoir it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house while home."" @CAPS2 Narciso is thinking his parents. In paragraph @NUM3 it says ""It was here I learned them real definition of family."" @CAPS3 it weren't for Narciso's parents, friends, family, and home, Narciso wouldn't have learned the real definition of ""family."" The mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez gratitude."	3	3		3																					
5069	5	"There are a few ways to describe the mood the @CAPS2 created in this memoir. They description im going to give is the @CAPS2 created a very happy & loving mood. For example, in paragraph @NUM1. it say's ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" That means that family doesnt have to be blood related for you and that person to unite and became very good friends. Also another example is in paragraph @NUM2, where it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done."" That shows she's a very loving and caring person to actually be @CAPS1 for something your parents have done. Those are a few way's to describe how the @CAPS2 created this happy and loving mood."	3	4		4																					
5070	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and comforting. The author described his home with great words and descriptions. While describing the meals and get togethers, the author made me feel at home. Memories are sometimes greater than plans of the future. Memories of homes are the best in remembering times at home. This memoir made me think of past times and happy memories. The vocabulary and extra information in this memoir made the mood of it very happy and comforting and made me want to read more about his past life.	1	1		1																					
5071	5	"There are alot of ways to describe the mood in this memoir, The mood created in the memoir is heartwarming.One example is in paragraph @NUM1, when Narciso Rodriguez is describing his house, he says, ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM2, when he says, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". And again in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""in our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" And @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. @CAPS1 example is in paragraph @NUM5, when he says, ""they (his parents) came selflessly, as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.In the memoir the mood that is created is heartwarming. Narciso Rodriguez's parents did a lot of this for him to make him feel like its Cuba. In my prospective this memoir is probably the most touching to my heart."	4	4		4																					
5075	5	"The are many strong feelings in the memoir but @CAPS1 is the most important one. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", Narciso Rodriguez talks about all of the sacrifices and Love in his house hold and how @CAPS2 is forever great full for his parents selflessness. ""Love of cooking that is still with me today (and for what I am extreemly greatfull)"" is what Rodriguez says @CAPS2 appricietes. @CAPS2 is also appriciative for the way @CAPS2 grew up and how his parents taught him that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood realetive."" @CAPS2 is so appricietive that @CAPS2 tells his parents constantly that @CAPS2 ""will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The author excpetially ex presses the mood of @CAPS1 in the line, ""I will never ferget that house or its gracious naighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Rodriguez is forever appriciative to his parents and their strong desitions that made him the person @CAPS2 is today."	3	3		3																					
5076	5	"the mood the author had created in the memoir is happyness for his home.The author says that family doesn't have to be blood related. the author states, ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."""	1	1		1																					
5077	5	The mood of the memoir is actually happy and grateful. I think this because the kid thanked his parents for letting them move to @LOCATION1 and all of them were happy that they took this sacrifice, Narciso especially. Narciso always thanks his mom and dad for thier bravery. He @CAPS1 he thanked them repeatedly and he could never have enough bravery to do that. That is how it is grateful. Something about the story has a very happy feel to it. Because the family is together and they are talking about how happy they are living with each other and even in @LOCATION1 it adds a very happy feel to it. That is what I think the author tried to create in the memoir.	3	2		3																					
5078	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" Narciso tells all about his parents and how greatful he is. Narciso created a mood during this memoir, he talked about his mom and dad and how they created his house into a home. Narciso's parents sacrificed a lot to move to @LOCATION1 and give their children a good life, even if it meant them having to leave behind family, friends and careers. The mood created overall was that I felt thankful for my home and family here in @LOCATION1. Then I also felt sympathy for Narciso's parents for leaving everything behind for their children. they also had to leave behind family, which is very hard to do. Narciso's parents made a very tough but wise deisicon but in the end it was worth it."	3	3		3																					
5079	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir I would have to say a loving mood because through-out the whole memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about how loving and caring and selflessness his parents were. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Also near the end of paragraph @NUM1 it says ""In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."" @CAPS1 are two reasons of why I believe the mood of the memoir the author created is a loving mood. Also in paragraph @NUM3 it says ""countless extended family members came and went- and their was often someone staying with us temporarily untill they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" That is the final reason of why I think the mood of the memoir is a loving mood."	3	4		4																					
5080	5	"In the memoir, @PERSON1, by @PERSON1, he talks about how thankful he is. One thing is that he is thankful for his babysitter and friend giving them food when they needed it. Also he was thankful for the community he had. Lastly, he was thankful for his parents' love and sacrifice.He said that ""@CAPS1 graced our kitchen table more often than not."" (@NUM1, Rodriguez) this shows he everybody helped each other out.Next he says that ""our neighborhood... Came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (@NUM2, Rodriguez) this how close-knit Rodriguez's community was. Lastly, he says that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how thankful he is toward his parents for sacrificing almost everything for him.By Narciso Rodriguez wrote this in a thankful mood. He thanks his babysitter, he thanks his community, and he thanks his parents. All of them contributed to his life."	3	3		3																					
5082	5	The mood created by the author is a warm happy mood. This is because he is talking about the love and bonds of family. He also is talking about home and how a house can become a home. He also talks about how he and most people are grateful for family and friends. All of this blends together to form a happy, good, warm mood to the story.	2	1		2																					
5085	5	"In the excerpt of the memoir Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1, the mood created is one of love for family and friends. The author explains his parents reasons for immigrating with such love and devotion that it is hard to not feel the same way. The author describes how everyone would eat together and they often had many more people eating with them. The author says ""...countless extended family members came and went..."" and then continues on to describe how his family lets other family members come stay with them until they get back on their feet. The author really shows the mood of the excerpt in a loving way and does this the most when saying you will always be grateful to his parents for moving to @LOCATION1 for him. The author shows that he truely cares about his family."	3	3		3																					
5086	5	"The mood the author creates in the memoir shows a soothing and grateful memory of the authors home and relatives. The author creates a peaceful tone representing calmness, comfort, and happiness displayed in his memories.One example of the authors way of creating a comfy and peaceful mood is in paragraph @NUM1 ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" @CAPS1 two sentences give a deep and warm thought of family and friends along with comforting images of kitchens and sweet aromas of cooking. This type of writing gives the reader a calm mood based on the comforting words, used in the sentence such as passionate, aromas, innocence, and warmAnother example is in paragraph @NUM2 where the author displays happiness and shows his gratfulness for having family and what his family has done for him. This adds to the mood in the memoir by representing how great family is and how much it can mean to people.Overall the author uses calming and strong words to get his images and feelings through in the memoir. Because of this he was able to create a peaceful, and comfortable mood while expressing his love for family and friends."	4	4		4																					
5094	5	"The @CAPS1 Created in the @CAPS2 is Not that of a @CAPS3 one. The @CAPS1 Created is cheerful and happy, as the narrator talks about his family and childhood. @CAPS4 talks about how his Neighborhood consisted of many races. as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants."" @CAPS4 talks about how they all live together in peace and @ORGANIZATION1. This @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that the meaning of family does not nesecarily mean you have to be related. The @CAPS1 is happy and @CAPS6 that friends are family too. "	2	2		2																					
5095	5	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir was happiness, love, unity, and satisfaction. These words describe the mood because in the memoir the author would talk about how eternally greatful he is for his family. He talked about the struggles they had but how they saw past them and realized that as long as they have each other thats all that matters. They got along great and were very happy they had each other. They also helped other people in need which seemed to complete their lives. They saw everyone as family and as little as they had, all they wanted was to give back. That was the mood created by the author. 	2	3		2																					
5097	5	"The memoir has a very happy mood to it. Paragraph @NUM1 gives a real feeling for what the authors home was like. It talks about the food and the music that the author emphasises his love for.

When i read that last sentence of the whole memoir I understood what feeling the author was getting. He or she was in all kinds of moods. Some was happy, some was grateful, and some was exciting. The mood the author was in made me realize that I need to appreciate what I got. In my home, in my school, everywhere and everyone around me. The mood of the author in the memoir was grateful. and happy."	1	3		2																					
5105	5	The mood created in Rodriguez's memoir is one of gratefulness + happiness. There are supporting feelings such as coziness + friendlyness but Rodriguez himself most exhibits gratefulness. In paragraph @NUM1, there is a great catalogue of gratefulness to the social skills that were passed down to him. When in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about their cuban feast, a small one perhaps but with true love + life. You get a true sense of the gratefulness Rodriguez displays for his parents not because of who they are or how much money they have or what they give him (materialistically), but being genuinely grateful of the nature + kindness bestowed to him.	2	3		3

Their is also a lot of love in the mood of the book because there are lots of mentions of family. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and doors open to the many people we considered family."" @CAPS2 arms opened and a big ""family"" are surely signs of lots of love. The mood of the excerpt is also cheerful because as Rodriguez says ""Passionate salsa music filled the air."" And ""a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air."" Music and feasting are two of the most cheerful things there are.By recalling experiences from his childhood @PERSON2 manages to make the mood of his memoir loving, grateful, and cheerful all at the same time."	4	3		4

""In a simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country where I celebrated my first birthdays."" @CAPS1 describes everything, as a positive learning experience, but shows that throughout the memoir, the theme is positive and greatful."	3	3		3

5113	5	Based on the auther in the @CAPS1, the mood created by the author was happy and sad, I sead that the mood created by the auther was happy because he lived in a comfortable with made by thier neighborhood was mostly, Spanish, Cuban, and italian immigrants at a time, it was no rasism, no segregation he lived his home peaceful, and the sad thing was that NARCISO RODRIGUEZ learned how to love and the the definition of family and about how to love but he saed that he would never how parents turn house into a simple home.	1	2		2

Like when the author talked about their parents and the house they live in and how it always made them remember like if they were still there. So if I was in the author's shoe's I would fell good about how I was raised by my parents to live in a better place even if that means giving up a lot of thing that mean a lot to you. That is what I think the author's mood is.	2	1		2

Second, some feelings the author also creates are friendly and caring; ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This shows how friendship was very important and gives off a friendly and caring feeling to the reader. Lastly, the author created a very happy and upbeat feeling in the begining of the memoir; ""Here, in the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed backdrop to life in our warm home.""

Throughout the excerpt @CAPS4 recalls all the feasts, parties and guests @CAPS4 had at the ""simple house"" his parents turned ""into a home"" as stated in @CAPS3 @NUM1.

The author's diction, or choice of words, such as congregation, celebration and warm home creates imagery of happy, joyful house and gives off an positive effect.

5131	5	In this article, the authors mood seemed to be happy and good. For example he likes that his parents are selfish and hard working people and tried to make his life happy. He also liked how they would invite a lot of people to come over for a visit and how they treated them like family. He also likes how they tought him things that they know how to do such as cooking. His mood did seem to change when he talked about how in Cuba having a job was a bit eser then how it was in New Jersey. They tried to make as much as they could and his mood seemed to be a bit worried. His mood changed to be happy again when he menchened that he loves the way they treat their house like a real home.	3	2		3																					
5132	5	"The author creates a very happy, but curious mood towards the reader. The reading made me happy for Narciso, but curious on how much his parents had to struggle to give Narciso the best life he could get. For example the author states that his parents had to ""start their lives over entirely, taking whatever jobs they could find."" Back in Cuba, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria (Narciso mom) had Studied chemical engineering."" This shows how much his parents lost due to immigrating to @LOCATION1. This made me wonder why they would do this. They did it because they wanted Narciso to have a good education and to live a good life. Also the author creates a sad emotion, by saying, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and carrers in the country they loved."" This made me sad because some of the immigrants had to leave their mother's, father's, and friends and @MONTH1 never see them again. The author creates a variety of different moods throught the memoir."	3	4		4																					
5133	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, there are several ways in which the author created the mood. For instance, when the author states how his family is from Cuba and they were able to move to a modest apartment.. The authors states, ""� originally from Cuba� could afford to move into a modest� apartment I would soon call home"" (@NUM1). This quote shows, that the authors parents wanted to give him a good life. They did this by moving themselves and him to @LOCATION2. Another example occurs when, the author describes what his kitchen ""heart of the house is like and how even though they are New Jersey, their house still feels like cuba. The author says, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@NUM2). This quote demonstrates, that the authors family made sure he still knew what cuba is like. The authors parents wanted to show him both sides of the world (cuba and @LOCATION2). Last, when the author says how grateful he is about his parents and the way he grew up. The author says, ""� I learned the real definition of ""family""� I learned there how to love"" (@NUM3).

He is thankful that his parents were still able to keep his cuban life alive. They didn't forget where they came from.Now I think about it one of his moods could be sad because he was the reason for all that happend.

Thats stating the mood was very cultural. Throughout the story it was hopefull they left Cuba and only lived in a @NUM1 room apartment but his parents were hopeful they would succeed. It was also very alive they always had someone other than their family at the table had doors open to family and friends. The Cuban music and food aroma drifted through the small place. Narciso Rodriguez will never forget how his parents turned a simple house into a home."	3	3		3																					
5174	5	"The author creates a sense of unity and happiness when she explaining how she had grown in her home, her neighborhood, and with her parents. Narciso first begins to tell us about where she grew up and how she was brought. She says that she was born in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey. She also says that she had lived in a traditional Cuban home and how she is thankful for her Cuban roots. Then Narciso continues by telling us about how there was a great sense of unity and ""family"" growing where she did. She says she grew in a neighborhood where everyone was one big family. Towards the end Narciso tells us how much she is greatful for her parents and their love & sacrifice. Throughout the whole memoir, Narciso's main focus is how she grew, her Cuban roots, her gratefulness for her her parents, and last of all her own definition of a real ""family""."	3	3		3																					
5178	5	"The mood created in the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" made me feel like I was in their kitchen eating Cuban food, and listen to music. Also, he told the life of a cuban immigrant. My grandfather followed the same path. He was a young boy when his family immigrated from Cuba. But he worked his hardest and became a very succesful man. This story completely reminds me of him and since I have some background with this, I know this ""mood"" and it speaks to me. The memoir really shows, ""The @CAPS1 @CAPS2."" a person coming here with close to nothing and become a very succesful person. Finally, the mood he created shows that if you put your mind too it you could accomplish anything. Also, it shows the mood created in a typical cuban home."	0	2		2																					
5179	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is being thankful. Narciso Rodriguez is thankful for his parents giving him a loving home in @LOCATION1. The author created a mood that the reader should be thankful for their parents. The sacrifice and love of anyones parents (like Rodriguez's) is what you should be most thankful for.	2	1		2

5184	5	"In the memoirs of Narciso Rodriguez, the mood of the writing is grateful. The two main examples of what Narciso is grateful for are his heritage and his family. Narciso is very grateful for his heritage and is a proud cuban. I know this because in paragraph @NUM1 he talks about how he loves cuban food, cooking, and music and how he is grateful for all of them. Another thing that Narciso is extremely grateful for is his family. His family moved up to @LOCATION1 before he was born so that their children could have a better life. They have sacrificed so much for their children including social and financial sacrifices. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso writes, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Any sane human being would be grateful to have parents that did what Narciso's parents did for him. As now evident, the main focus and mood of this excerpt from @PERSON1 memoirs is that he is grateful."	3	3		3																					
5185	5	"narciso Rodriguez is a clothing designer who wrote a memoir Home: The blueprints of our lives. The mood created in this memoir is a warm feeling that surrounds the meaning of family and home.narciso says in the memoir in @CAPS1 @NUM1 ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the Aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the back drop to lif in our warm home."" That proves that narcisos house was a warm family home, that was alway welcaming.narcisos comunity was also close like a family. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 it proves this when saying ""Close � knit community of hones, hard working imigrants who extent a hand to people who were clearly in need"". He also states that blood does'nt mean your family. Like his surrogate grandparents. In @CAPS1 @NUM3 he proves that his parents were alway welcoming � ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."	4	3		4																					
5187	5	In the @CAPS1 by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso seems to get a certin mood, tward his parents, a mood of happyness and greatfullness.Thorought the hole @CAPS1 Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for everything they have done, and gave up just for him to have a better life. His parents gave up their Jobs, thier houses, they left ther family there, thier friends, and in return they go to @CAPS2 and give thier son a better life, witch he is constantly saying how greatfull, and how honored he is to have parents who will give up everything they had for him Over All thorought The @CAPS1 @PERSON1 sets a mood of happiness, and gratfull ness tward his loving parents.	2	3		3																					
5189	5	"The mood in the memoir is gratefulness and happiness. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful."" This shows how @CAPS1 thanks his parents for loving cooking. Skill that cooking and his eternal gratitude. Also, in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 is happy that @CAPS1 grew up in @LOCATION1 and how grateful @CAPS1 is to them for passing down their traits and loves to him and all their hard work."	3	3		3																					
5190	5	"The author created a heartfelt mood in the memoir. The mood the author created was greatful mood. In the memoir it states ""skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" This quote make me feel grateful for my culture and heritage. This story also make me feel proud. In the story it states ""My Mother and father had come to this country with such courage"". I feel so proud that they wanted to leave to come have a better life. Lastly the mood is happy. This story is happy because he learns a good lesson and he pround of his parents and culture."	2	3		3																					
5192	5	The mood Narciso Rodriguez creates is gratefullness. When I read this, I feel thankful like the author. Although his family had a good life in Cuba, they left to give their kids a better life. @CAPS1 the author's family hadn't left Cuba, I think the mood would be different. Then the author wouldn't think his parents were selfless (for that reason, anyway) @CAPS1 my parents did that for my siblings and me, I would want people to feel grateful as well. @PERSON1 understands how hard it was for his parents. Another mood could be guilt. I feel guilty when I read this because I don't always thank my parents or apreciate them. Narciso Rodriguez created a lot of moods in the memoir.	2	1		2																					
5194	5	"The mood created by @PERSON1, the author of the memoir, Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a comforting one. This is shown, for instance, by his reccolection of his childhood in his family's home being fond. For example, he states that he is ""eternally grateful"" for his parents passing on, ""their rich culinary skills and love of cooking"" that he claims to still have. Also, he remembers life as being neighborly and treating neighbors and friends as part of their family with kindness and sharing. This is shown when Narciso says, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" In addition the comforting feeling is shown when Narciso says, ""I learned here about how to love.... My parents turned this simple house into a home. This shows that Narciso had a great place to grown up in and has fond and comforting memories of it."	3	3		3																					
5198	5	"In the nonfiction memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the author created a warm, busy, and giving mood. The mood is warm because in the memoir it says ""the congregation of family and friends and endless celebration that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This shows she were a lot of friends and family together in this home showing friends and family being together. Also the mood is busy because in the memoir it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporaily until they were able to get back on their feet"". This shows how people were always coming and going in this home. The mood was also giving. It was giving because in the memoir it says ""It was close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people, who while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"". This shows how people were given when othrs needed help even if they were not the same kind. That is the mood the author gave in this memoir."	3	4		4																					
5200	5	"The mood portrayed in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir is closeness. The first way in which the extreme closeness of Narciso's childhood is displayed in the memoir is through the way that, ""all of the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" when, during the time period that this story is taking place in, the many different immigrants would never usualy even think of mingaling with each other. This shows that, in Narciso's youth nobody cared about race and every person in his neighbor hood was extremely close to the friendly people who surrounded them, regardless of ethnicity. The second form in which the tight bond between his literal family and his many neighbors is describing all of his aquaintances as ""family"" that have a close enough bond to each other to be able to show up at each others doors and immediatly be taken in and fed a meal that the Rodriguez family worked hard to procure. This insight into the early years of Narciso's life shows that he grew up with the understanding that ""...' family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" and that you should treat all of your friends as you would family. Finaly, and possibly the most extreme way that the @CAPS1 shoed their extrordinary closeness to their friends and relatives is by keeping their, ""... arms and their door open to the many people we considered a family..."" This willingness to give anyone they knew a place to stay and food to eat shows how extremly close they were to everyone the knew. Wether it be by always having their door open, to mixing between many races, or considering almost everyone family the Rodriguez family showed extreme closeness with the rest of human kind."	4	4		4																					
5202	5	In the article Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood in this story is very happy, and heart warming. When she talks about how they have their own cultures, and live in the kitchen, and how the sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and wishing you were there. The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you. It makes the mood happy.	3	2		3																					
5203	5	"The author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood in ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."" The mood of this memoir could be described as nostalgic or even love to some extent (as in loving his old home, family, friends, ect.) The author mentions ""endless celebrations ... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This helps create the mood because the author is reminicing on the events that happened in his home (in this case, they were very happy memories) The author mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that during a time of racism in the @CAPS1 his community was so close-knit that people were like family. He even states: ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" These examples from the memoir help create a nostalgic mood, it also shows the love throughout the community. Finally, in paragraph @NUM2 the author says he ""will never forget"" the things he ""learned there about how to love."" Which builds on these two themes as well (due to the fact he is remembering the feeling of love he expirienced and learned.) In conclusion, the mood(s) of this story would be of nostalgic and/or love."	3	3		3																					
5209	5	"In the story Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created. For example, one mood is love. @CAPS1 family did everything for love. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This quote shows @CAPS1 family took care of everyone even thought they did not have much themselves.Another example of mood is being together Narciso's family helped out all imagrants to get back on their feet. Paragraph @NUM2 says, ""they came selflessly, as many imagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Narciso's family helped the less fortunate very often. The mood of this story is very inviting and peaceful."	3	3		3																					
5210	5	"The mood created by the author is described in many ways.First, he described a friendly mood. In paragraph three, he says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" And in paragraph four, he states, ""... Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us. and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not.""@CAPS1, the mood is described as warm and family-like. In paragraph four, he states, ""Countless extended family members came and went..."" And in paragraph seven, it says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood...""@CAPS2, it's a loving mood. In paragraph four, it states, ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" And in paragraph six, he says, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and preseverance, and I've thank them repeatedly.""To conclude, the mood created by the author is described in many ways."	4	3		4																					
5212	5	"In the excerpt, the author created a relaxed tone in the memoir. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". This shows how equipped his parents were with Cuban culture. Culture was a big piece of Narciso Rodriguez child hood and life. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This shows that the author is trying to focus your attention on the culture of the @CAPS1 and that the house was relaxed and calm which is the tone of the author."	2	2		2																					
5214	5	The mood created by the author overall is gratefulness. As Narciso writes about some events in his life you notice he mostly talks about his family. He says that you don't have to be a blood relative to be family, what matters is love.Narciso is mostly grateful to his parents who sacraficed their old lives in Cuba for him to have a better life in the US. Their jobs in Cuba were great but when they got to @LOCATION1 they had to have whatever job they could get.Not only did Narciso's family teach him how to love he learned the real definition of family. It saw what courage it took for his parents to turn the simple house they once had into a home for him.	2	2		2																					
5217	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir was very positive and warm, showing gratitude, and promoting the real definition of family. An example of his gratitude towards his parents is when he states: ""My Parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Narciso describes his sense of true family in paragraph @NUM1 when he says: ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso describes that his parents were very courageous coming to @LOCATION1 having no previous knowledge of the culture or language. He expresses how thankful he is for his parents to come to @LOCATION1, leaving everything they knew behind, in order to give him a better life. He describes his neighborhood being a true family, adding big dinners together, and helping one another in times of need ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice... what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done... I think them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The mood of the memoir truly does demonstrate the importance of family, love, warmth, and gratefulness."	4	4		4																					
5220	5	"The mood created by the author is a grateful mood. It's grateful because the boy kept on talking about how thankfull he is for all the stuff he has. Another reason why the mood is grateful is because all of the people in the neighborhood will all come together and eat with eachother, visit with eachother, and help eachother. I know the mood is grateful because it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."""	1	2		2																					
5221	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is talking about this boy's life and about his parents and what they do for a living and what they are and how they are nice to other people.... I think the authors mood would be like happy...Nice and caring on other people and not being rude. Its all about careing, and love, happiness.	1	1		1																					
5222	5	"In the memoir from ""Home: Blueprints of our lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author stretches the importance of family. The mood that Narciso Rodriguez creates is a comfortable, loving, homey feeling. He states that he grows up learning that ""family has nothing to do with being a blood relative"". He says that his family welcomed everybody. Strangers that needed help, neighbors, and extended family. He creates a loving mood when he said he lived in a ""close-knit community"". He also says ""These cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1, when @PERSON2 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" you can sense his appreciation and feel the comforting atmosphere. Those were the moods I felt while reading this memoir by, Narciso Rodriguez."	3	2		3																					
5223	5	"In the memor from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez his mood is very meaning full. You can tell that what he's saying he really means it, he's senser. He say's ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen"" in paragraph @NUM1 line @NUM2. In paragraph @NUM2 line @NUM4 he say's ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immgrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need. Or when he tells us that his first friend was his babysitter @PERSON2 who was his land lords daughter. Narciso Rodriguez tells us how his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family. in paragraph @NUM5 line @NUM6. He tells us in paragraph @NUM7 second line how his mother and father ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life"" even if it did mean leaving behind their loved ones, and things they loved. In the last sentence of his memor he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.""With those last words you from Narciso Rodriguez you know that he is senser, about what he's saying and that he could never thank his parents for what they did for him."	3	3		3																					
5224	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very satisfactory mood. The author uses a satisfactory tone, too, especially when the author is explaining what a family is. Near the end of the memoir it has a very satisfactory mood, partly because it is near the end and they are ending the memoir, and also it is explaining what a family is. The mood of the memoir is also interesting because the author uses information of Narciso Rodriguez's life to help explain what a family is. The mood created by the author in the memoir is very satisfactory and interesting.	2	2		2																					
5225	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez by The blue prints of Our Lives, the author sets a deep and powerful mood to the setting. Throught this memoir we feel happy as he explains his culture, for example as it states in paragraph (@NUM1) ""Here the innocense of childhood, the congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home's."" @CAPS1 the author uses warm words that fill our heart's. For example in paragraph (@NUM2) it state's ""But in reality there is no way to express my grattitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age. And @CAPS2 this author uses @CAPS3 to use further information which explains Narciso's feeling towards certain childhood memories. Such as the cuban culture. These are three examples of how the author sets the mood in this memoir."	3	3		3																					
5231	5	The narrator is describing the life he grew up in. How his parents cooked in the kitchen and played Cuban music. How great things were. He was trying to create a warm happy mood by decribing how his parents try to help the people and do the best the could With anything. Showing greatness in life when you barly have much yourselve.	1	2		2																					
5236	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez From Home: The blueprints of our lives the author sets a sad mood in this memoir. An example of the sad mood set the author describes his neighborhood. The author describes his neighbor hood by saying ""our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, cuban and Italian immigrants."" (@NUM1) This show they live in a run down neighborhood because most immigrants are poor when they arrived at the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 example is when he describes his family. The author say's ""There was often someone staying with us temporarly until they were able to get back on their feet"". (@NUM2) This shows the poverty that they lived around because they had to put shelter around those who couldn't aford it. The last way the author describes the sacrifice of his parents, The author say's ""The Faith that this would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"". (@NUM3) This is a sad mood because it shows how their @CAPS2 back fired and they didn't have a very happy time. That is why I think the tone of this memoir is a sad one."	2	3		3																					
5241	5	"The author creates a mood of joy and thankfulness in the memoir of how great life was and how grateful he is for what was given to him. The author writes about how even with the little they had how happy his house was with all the music and visitors that were mentioned in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. Also the author portrays how thankful and grateful he is for everything he was taught, was sacrificed for him, and for the life lessons that were instilled in him. In paragraph @NUM3, the author writes how he learned that ""family"" wasn't only blood relatives but was all your friends that would always be there for you as you would be for them. The author also explains how grateful he is for everything his parents went through for him in paragraphs @NUM4 and @NUM5 giving mood of happiness and grateful ness. Narciso also creates a mood of love, as of that he had for his parents and ""family"" that he says transferred his house into a home in paragraph @NUM6."	3	3		3																					
5244	5	"The mood in this memoir was very happy and grateful to be living in the house where Narciso had such good neighbors as family, who were close to him. Even though Narciso's neighbors weren't actually family (as in blood related) Narciso still felt comfortable with them as if they really were his family. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" @CAPS1 on their street the immagrents were like a family. They all carried for each other and were happy."	2	3		3																					
5247	5	The mood in the memoir is peaceful and loving The reason why it is peaceful is because there is no fighting in this story at all. This story is loving because throughout the whole thing the only thing that I learned about was how to respect and love each other. There are many examples of this in paragraph @NUM1 and paragraph @NUM2. This is the tone of the story.	1	1		1																					
5248	5	"A wonderful mood was created by Narciso Rodriguez, the author, in this memoir. While reading this story, I could feel the love, peace, & appreciation created by his words. Throughout the memoir, he really expands on the love & appreciation he feels for his parents. Paragraph @NUM1 states: ""I'll always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice."" Also, in paragraph @NUM2, he again mentions his parents & how they had turned a house into a home. You can feel his awe & appreciation spilling out of his words. Also, the childhood home is described in paragraph @NUM3. Rodriguez describes the house's feeling as warm & elaborates on the things he's grateful to and will always love. The mood of this memoir is very specifically felt."	3	3		3																					
5255	5	"In the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the narrator had shown happiness throughout the memoir.One example of when the author showed happiness was when they were thinking about cooking. They admired when their parents helped and teached them how to cook. They would hear the music in the back that they adored as their heritage or backround. In the story it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking.""When the authors still live with their parents their relatives would come over to eat and have fun. To reflect back on those memories made the author happy. In the story it says, ""Countless extended family members came and went-- and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back upon their feet.""@CAPS1 example is when the author thought of the time when their parents moved to @LOCATION1. They thought of how lucky their parents were to come to such a nice place. In the story it says, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."	3	4		4																					
5257	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is to show gratefulness towards the author's parents. He wanted to portray the fact that his parents sacrifice their lives for the author's life.Narciso repeatedly conveys the message that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", but people who care for one another; people who ""come together in great solidarity and friendship"".The most important family to Narciso are his parents who sacrifice their lives, in order ""to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"". He says that he will always be grateful to his parents. He admits ""that what they did was a much more courageous thing than ""he"" could have ever done"". Narciso infact, cannot thank his parents enough for showing them how important family and friends are.In the end, @PERSON1 realizes that a home is a place you live, and celebrate birthdays, and do work, but mainly a place where everyone is welcome and a home is a family in itself."	4	3		3																					
5259	5	The mood story the author creates is a prideful memoir of his life/home and what others did for him, while living in a time of hate/racism. He feels foreverly grateful for the love and sacrifice his parents showed to him. He was happy that during these times people of of different culture/ethnicity were treating all in the community like family. The mood and emotion of this memoir is of pride/love for others and caring.	1	1		1																					
5261	5	"In the story The Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez the @CAPS1 creats a mood, here is the mood created. The first mood is the one of her house. She describes friends and family with cuban music along with the food here is one example of the food and music ""Passionate Cuban music...filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Another mood is the family and friends. An example of this is in paragraph four where it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" And those are some reasons how the @CAPS1 set a mood in The Blueprints of our lives."	2	2		2																					
5264	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a mood -- feeling, rather -- of belonging, ""home"", and comfort. He recalls growing up in an apartment where ""countless extended family members came and went"" and his life was full of people from his community -- cousins, aunts, friends. Narciso recalls that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" -- and there is a sense of belonging. Comfort: ""the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.""There's also a sense of thanks in this -- gratefulness, one could say. Narciso's parents left everything behind when they immigrated to @LOCATION1 from Cuba -- and as he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And this -- all of this -- creates the sense of ""home""."	3	3		3																					
5266	5	The mood the author created was how they were immagrants and they had to adjust the the @CAPS1 way of life but they still celebrated his first birthdays In that very house. They will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. It was deminstration of how important family and friends are. And that I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.	1	2		2																					
5268	5	"The mood is shown and explained in several ways throughout the memoir. The mood of this short story is happiness and of a sense of family. The first example of this mood is in paragraph @NUM1 when the @CAPS1 says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @PERSON1 is showing that just because someone is not related to another person they cannot be family. Another example of the mood of the excerpt is when is when Narciso says ""My parents always kept to their arms and door opened to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" The @CAPS1 is showing that people who love each other like family have each other's backs, no matter what. A final example is when the @CAPS1 states ""I learned the real definition of family. And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned about how to love."" The @CAPS1 is saying he is greatful for the people who showed him what ""family"" really is. In closing this story shows true family and how a house becomes a home."	3	4		4																					
5269	5	I would say the mood that the author was in was happy. I would say that because he always has something nice to say. He never gets into fights with his mother or father. He talks about how he is grace full. how he would never agure with his parents. How he's  always had a good life from when he was a kid to now when he is an @CAPS1. He was going to move into A new @NUM1 bedroom apartment soon. That way he can call It his home.	1	2		2																					
5270	5	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The @CAPS1 of our Lives"" it tells us about a kid from Cuba.This memoir has a positive mood. It says that they keep family or friends in their home untill they get back on their feet. It tells us about the neighborhood he live in. And how theres many different types of immigrants there and how they all get along. The kid's parents have friends and family over for dinner. The parents give up everything their jobs, friend, and families so that their kid could grow up in @LOCATION1. "	2	2		2																					
5272	5	"The mood created in Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, is a very happy and loving mood. As it says in the memoir ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"". This means he is happy and loves his parents have done. It also says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance"". He loves his parents and is happy with what they have done. The last thing the memoir says is ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This ment he was very thankful for what they have done. Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our lives, has a happy and loving mood. This happy and loving mood is exspressed throughout the memoir."	2	2		2																					
5274	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is the appreciation through the author's parents. Another mood is the happiness of ""home"" or family. In paragraph @NUM1, the author is grateful to her parents for their love and sacrifice and courage. In the last paragraph, paragraph @NUM2, Narciso mentions how welcomed refugees that just arrived to the country were at their house to stay, that the ""warmth of this Kitchen and humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with life and love"" made her learn the definition of ""family""."	2	2		2																					
5275	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" the mood created by the author is that his parents were loving and caring. His parents were loving and caring because they made their house into a home. His parents were selfless and caring when they come to the United States. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"". This shows his parents were loving and made sacrafices for their children to have a good life. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""they struggled both personally and financially"". This shows they cared about their family because they sacraficed things to struggle & make their family happy. In conclusion, the mood is being caring and loving."	3	3		3																					
5276	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso mood in the memoir seemed happy and grate. Narciso's mood sound happy because when he was telling us (readers) about his life growing up in Newark, New Jersey and explaining how his house was he was saying how his landlord and daughter nice and how the landlord's daughter was his first friend, and he was also saying how his family and friends were very close. In the neighborhood it was despite customs elsewhere, all of the cultures came together in great solidarity (happiness) and friendship. His mother and father made the house cozy and at the end of the memoir the author said ""I will never forget how his parents turned their simple house into a home meaning that he never had a home like the one he lived in now."	3	3		3																					
5277	5	"In this memoir I think the mood is a warm and nice one.One example on how its warm is how he discribes the home. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM1. ""Within the walls, my young parents created a traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This is a warm mood because when you think of a kitchen you think of a warm room with sweet eromahs of delicious food in the oven.A reason why it is a nice mood is because all of the cultures got along and treated each other like family. For example, it says in paragraph @NUM2, ""All of theus cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" It is nice because there was alot of racism at that time and all the cultures overcame it together.The last reason why there is a warm and nice mood is how he apreciates what his parents have done. For example it says in paragraph @NUM3, ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever don."" This is saying that he is greatfull that his parents left Cuba to give him a better life.Thats why I think the mood of the memoir is warm and nice."	4	3		4																					
5278	5	The mood in this memoir is very relaxed and proud. The author showed that he was so proud of his parents and his culture. He talked with a relaxed feeling and loving everything about his home and culture. Also the mood is so grateful. He is so grateful of his neighbors and how they all came together. Also he was grateful to have his family and friends in his apartment. The author was just so proud of his life and parents.	2	2		2																					
5282	5	In the memoir many moods were expressed. I think the mood that was expressed the most was happiness. Narciso described to us that no matter what happened her family and close friends would always feel a sense of belonging with each other. This gave everyone mentioned in the story great reason to be happy and feel good about themselves and each other. In conclusion, the strongest mood in the story was happiness.	2	1		2																					
5287	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The blueprints of our lives the mood is heartfilling, and about appreciction. In the memoir @CAPS1 says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 thanks his parents so much for everything they've done for him. @CAPS1 also says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 knows it wasn't easy but loves how his parents managed to give him the best life possible. @CAPS1 writes, ""what they did was much more courageous then I could hae ever done."" @CAPS1 knows his parents took chances and did whatever to keep him happy which sets this mood to be so warm and heart filling."	3	3		3																					
5291	5	"The mood I think the author created in the memoir was love.The reason why I say love is because to me he cares about the his family and he also stayed with his family tradition and he care and follows them. He also loved being with his family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 in the article it say; ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to LOVE. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home. and to me that shows Love thats why I think the author created Love as his mood in the memoir."	2	2		2																					
5294	5	"The mood created in this memoir was manily for me family and Love. for most of the memoir the author was talking about exprens he had in the house, and the love he had's for his family and frend's. The first example I have for the mood is when he say's ""as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."". This shows the parents love for the kids. a second example I have is for family when the reading say's ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great senst that ""family"". and he is talking about thy are all so close nit. This reading was a good example of a closs nit comunity and of parent scracise. for they kid's."	2	2		2																					
5297	5	"The mood of this memoir is nonfiction. The mood is that because Narciso Rodriguez is telling about his past in his and it is about the life he once lived in New Jersey, in a Cuban, Italian, and a Spanish neighborhood. The house was transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with Cuban Aromas and Cuban musics. The mood became joyful because of the Family's love of Cuban Music, and Cuban cooking, (which is really good). The mood also is represented with the Family, a loving and caring family in a nice apartment building. The mood is non-fiction, joyful, loving, and caring, I know this because the ""home"" is so pleasent to be inside."	2	1		2																					
5301	5	The author created such a specific mood for this memoir. She @CAPS1 off by telling alittle history of how she came to be in @LOCATION1 but quickly changed it to what her home was like. Narciso emphisized the importance of her culture but more importantly her family and friends. she talked about how the latin music, the big cuban cooking all made what is her home. She focuses more on the gratitude of her parents even more than her heritage and family bonds. She's focused on how her parents made a house a home.	2	2		2																					
5302	6	There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. Safety was an issue with the dirigibles because of the highly flammable gas hydrogen. So, if the dirigibles explode over New York many people could be killed in the very populated. Another problem is keeping the derigible @CAPS1 so people can get off while the wind moves the back end of itself. The only way was to tie lead weights down in the back of the dirigible, but it would be dangerous over people down below. So, these obstacles workers faced, never got past them and so they made the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for tourists in the observation area.	2	2		2																					
5305	6	"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1. The builders of the Empire State Building faced opstacles in the building of the Empire State Building, in allowing dirigibles to dock there.One reason is that Al Smith (four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office) had made the tower tall... The hight of the building was 1,250 ft. But after almost losing the title of worlds tallest tower he announced that there would be a top or hat put on the tower.Another reason is the tower was made for Dirigibles (blimps) That Could @CAPS2 people from New York to New Jersey. Smith wanted a place where dirigibles could dock off. But it never happened because the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, and on May 6, 1937 the owners of the State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it was over New York.In the 1930's the idea was dropped after another dirigible was trying to proform a stunt. The Empire State Building never got to fofil what it was made for."	1	1		1																					
5306	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it illegal for the dirigible to tie up on the building. Another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire over the densely populated area of New York, there would be a good chance that many people would be hurt. A final obstacle faced was ""nature itself."" The winds on the top of the Empire State building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though a dirigible would be attached to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around the mooring mast in a dangerous way. Many obstacles were faced by the workers of the Empire State Building in order to allow a dirigible to dock there."	3	3		3																					
5310	6	The obstacles the builders face were great. They explained how most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use a different gas called hydrogen which is highly flammable. Following that they told @LOCATION1 how Hindenburg by fire in 1937 which used hydrogen. They realized if this had happen in a urban area it could have been worse. Anthore obstacle they faced was the wind. If the dirigible was parked at mooring mast the violent wind speeds would make the Blimp shift and cause strees on the building steel frame. The greatest obstacle was the law passed. The law stated that no airships could fly to low in urban areas. This would keep blimps from landing there.	3	3		3																					
5314	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to construct this marvelous building One obstacle was making sure the stress of the building from the dirigible would go to the foundation of the building and not the top or middle where it could cause it to collapse. As said in the text ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" @CAPS1 the building had to be changed in many ways to make it stable enough for dirigible to dock.Another obstacle was the weather above the building which was very strong winds and air currents. This would mean that the dirigible would just be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street"" and that's not a safe thing to have highly flammable hydrogen floating around above millions. An obstacle as well that came with these dirigibles was all the time and effort they had to put in to learn how to safely install a mooring mast. This took people going to professionals like the Navy and finding out the proper way. The mooring mast on the Empire State Building caused many obstacles to get in the way."	4	4		4																					
5315	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Al Smith was the architect, and man behind the idea of the Empire State building. He and the maker of the Chrysler building were competing against eachother to construct the world's tallest building. To make the Empire State building bigger than the Chrysler building, Smith was going to construct somthing that John Tauranac stated, ""Would be equipped for an age of transportation that was only the dream of aviation pioneers"". That dream was to travel by blimp. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for the dock of air ships. It was not going to be as easy as the concept. The architects couldn't drop a mooring mass on the roof because it would stress the buildings frame. The greatest reason the mast would never fufill its destiny was for safety. The excerpt states, ""Most derigibles used hydrogen"". Hydrogen is flammable. There was also a law that was, ""against air ships flying too low over urban areas"". After numberous attempts and modifications, the idea was shelved."	2	3		3																					
5316	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the lack of a suitable landing area. A mooring mast added to the top of the building would dirigible's to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on, the electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and get passengers could safely get on and off The dirigible by walking down a gang @CAPS1 to an open observation platform. They of the Empire state Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations of the U.S. Naval Air station in Lakehurst, New Jersey.	2	1		2																					
5319	6	"The builders of the empire state buildings had many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Things such as the wind, the actual docking, and the people getting off safely. The actual docking was impractical it would be nearly impossible to connect the winch.     The wind was the main reason for the fate of the mast. First the wind current was so strong that the pilot would have a very difficult time getting close enough. The captain of the, ""Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of the forceful winds. Also even if it could tie up the back of the dirigible would swing around fiercefuly. So the builders were dealing with an impractical task"	2	3		3																					
5320	6	The first obstacle that it faced with having to reconstruct the body frame so that it could support the mooring mast, The second is that dirigibles from other country's used hydrogen, wich is highly flammable, instead of helium. The third reason wich should have been apparent from the start was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The last reason is the wind conditions at that hight made it impossible for the dirigibles to land there without the tail and swaying in the wind.	3	2		3																					
5324	6	"In the reading The Mooring Mast written by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced an obstacle. Which was attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there.  Not to mention Dirigibles were thought of being the transportation of the future. First, ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@NUM1). This quote shows that for one this Dirigible would need to find a proper landing area. As well as not being able to fit. Thus, there was some need of more area space. Also, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (@NUM2). It seems as though there was not enough space due to the Dirigible being so long. It also shows how would these architects come up with a plan in making this work, so that way it would fit properly. Therefore, there was an obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced. Which was the lack of a suitable area."	2	1		2																					
5326	6	"In building the Empire State Building, the builders faced some problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles that the builder faced were actually having a way for dirigibles to dock at about 1,250 feet above the ground. The strong air currents and changing in the wind direction also made it difficult for the piolots to steer the dirigibles close enough to the mast for docking. A final problem that the builders faced was a law that ""airships flying too low over urban areas"". (@NUM1). Which basically means that if it was docked at the Empire State building, then it would be too low to an urban aera and that's against the law."	2	3		3																					
5327	6	"The idea of mooring dirigibles to the top of the building that stood 1,250 feet above the streets of downtown New York was a facinating and amazing idea. An idea that would bring New York into a whole ""age of transportation"" (@NUM1). Unfortunately this wonderful idea had a few holes in the plans. Later the architects that were building the mooring mast had discovered that their idea was not going to be fulfill. The idea had too many obstacles to overcome. The fact that ""most dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM2). If anything was to go wrong, it would be catostrophic seeing as how below them were highly populated streets. Also, ""the greatest obstacle was nature itself"" (@NUM3). There was just too much wind to keep the aircraft steady and undercontrol. The reality of the fact was that the idea to moor derigibles sounded great but there are far too many risks to carry out the plan."	2	4		2																					
5329	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was the safety issue. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, most foreign dirigibles used the flammable element hydrogen rather than helium. A fire would be very deadly in a highly populated area like downtown New York. Another obstacle the builders were faced with was the wind. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the un-tied back of the dirigible to thrash around and even ""swivel around the mooring mast."" When a dirigible is moored in open fields, they can be weighted down with lead weights. Doing this in open air above the Empire State building would be un-safe due to pedestrians below. The final obstacle builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM3, it says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" This is why the mooring mast for dirigibles of the Empire State building never served its purpose."	3	3		3																					
5331	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The steel frame of the Building needed to be modified and strengthened to make a place for dirigibles to dock. Also, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made. The last obstacle builders had was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame. It was not easy for builders to build a mooring mast on top of the highest building that was one thousand two hundred fifty feet, but the architects reached their point by designing the mooring mast.	2	3		3																					
5333	6	There were many reasons why architects had problems allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. One of the problems was that most dirigibles were @NUM1 ft long and it would be to much. There Would only be a single cable tether and it would add stress to the buildings frame. The entire Steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.The greatest reason why the mooring mast would never fullfill its purpose is safety. Most dirigibles from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obsticale to the successful use of the mooring was nature itself. The winds on the top of the buildings were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back of the Ship would swivel around. They are meant to land on open playing feilds but using these at the empire state building Where they would be dangling high above pedestrians was not safe	3	3		3																					
5335	6	There were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One obstacle was the wind. At higher elevation the wind is much more powerful. This would make it very difficult to accually get the dirigible close to the mast. Also the structure of of Empire State Building. The framework was not built for the amount of weight that would be on top of the building. Builders made over @MONEY1 worth of fortifying the framework. Those are some obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
5338	6	In the excerpt, the Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the construction of the Empire State Building faces many problems. One of these problems is that the governer of New York, Al Smith wanted the building to be the tallest in the world. In order to do this you would need a mask to break the record. The mask made to made nature a danger to the whole building because of violent air current. Another reason how the Empire State Building failed is because their was a law banning airships flying too low over urban areas. This law went in effect because of a German dirigible caught on fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Those were just some of the many problems the dirigibles faced while passing the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
5339	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A one thousand-foot dirigible, attached to a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings framed if the dirigible was placed at the top of the building. The buildings frame would have to be strengthened and modified to accommodate the situation. Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications would have to be installed into the framework. some other obstacles builders faced was the safety. The dirigibles ran on hydrogen which is flammable. Another obstacle was the weather. The winds shifted at the top of the Empire State building were shifting due to violent air currents. One last obstacle was an existing law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. The idea of a dirigible quietly disappeared.	3	3		3																					
5342	6	Based on the story it all started when they had build the empire state building and the workers should have knowned that the building was too big for the wind climate, up in the sky and plus when you make a building like that you have to make sure it's strong enough to keep balance.                         They faced problem's like when the U.S. tried to make a deal with them if they would let them use the top of the building for a dock to let civilians on the deck, and after they made a law that no more blimps can land on the dock a blimp attempted to land on the dock.	1	1		1																					
5343	6	Obstacles the bulders faced was if they put a Mooring @CAPS1 At the top of the building it will Add stress to the building and they would have to modify the building to support the mooring @CAPS1. Another @CAPS2 they @CAPS3 is safty Most @CAPS4 Are Filled with Hydrogen which Are Highly Flammable. If there was A Fire it could @CAPS5 @CAPS6 of people Due to the fact its A Densely Populated Area. Nature Itself Also seems to @CAPS7 A @CAPS2 the winds Above the building were very Violent. then theirs the law where Airships can @CAPS9 Low Above urban areas.	3	3		3																					
5347	6	There were many problems with allowing dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building. When designing the mast they realized that with the weight of the dirible, the buildings frame would have stress. (paragraph @NUM1) They also noticed that the diribles from other countries used hydrogen and not helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @NUM2). A factor of building the mast that was out of the builders control was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting. (paragraph @NUM3). Law was also a problem when wanting to construct the mast. There was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. (paragraph @NUM4). With the factors of weight, gas, nature, and law the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles.	2	2		3																					
5348	6	"In the excerpt from, ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L�sted, tells about the original purpose to the mast on top of the Empire State Building was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles (blimps).Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was the tremendous stress that the mast would put on the Empire State Building. In order to get around this, they put frame work around the entire building's frame. Another obstacle that was faced was safety. First of all, the wind at the top of the Empire State Building was to great for any blimp to stay aloft in mid-air without being tossed around. Finally, the possibility of the blimp either popping on the spikes, or blowing up because of the hydrogen, over New York City.In conclusion, the mast on the Empire State Building, looked good on paper, but once you add in natural elements, the mast had too many flaw to it."	2	3		3																					
5351	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders of the Empire State Building endured many obstacles when trying to dock dirigibles. The idea of a mooring mast began when former governor of New York, Al Smith was determined to make the Empire State building the tallest in the world. When the Chrysler building became the tallest Smith was said to have announced, ""... The Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet"" (Mooring Mast). Although many were enthusiastic about the plan, there were many obstacles before dirigibles docked there. The first problem was stability. If a thousand pound dirigible was connected to the building by one tether then it, ""... would add stress to the buildings frame"" (Mast) Which would have made the builders completely alter the buildings structure. Another reason was safety At the time most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, a highly flammable substance, instead of helium. Which could be a great hazard considering all the people it could harm below. However, the greatest obstacles for the dirigibles future was nature. Above the Empire State there was wild wind currents causing the back of the dirigible to swivel. When builders couldn't find a practical solution to all these obstacles, it was realized dirigibles would not be kept there for the safety of all New York City inhabitants."	3	3		3																					
5353	6	"Based on excerpt builders of Empire State building faced alot of obsticles. Here are my three points to consider. They need to make plans that were very difficult and hard. The Blimps and @CAPS2 could crash in to the building. It was too high firstly. The builders needed to make long difficult, plans. They needed to make the right skeleton for the mast to fit the rest of the building. They had to make changes to the existing plans to fit the mooring mast. Secondly, The Blimps and @CAPS2 could cause an accident. Blimps fly about @NUM1 miles per hour and they could approach the mast at a speed that is too fast and destroy it. Lastly, The mast was very high. It would be hard for blimps to reach the height of the mast. Irving Clavan said, ""... Such a height made it desirable to post poned to a later date for the landing gears."" In @CAPS1 builders of the Empire State building faced a lot of obsticles. The plans were difficult the Blimps and @CAPS2 could crash and the mast height was too high."	2	2		2																					
5355	6	"Thraghat The process of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle that the bilders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there occurred in the actual ""building"" process. Because the mast wald add to much stress to the frame of the building if simply attached to its flat roof, the buldas had to reconstruct the steel frame of the building in order to safely place the mast on top, a very expensive and time consuming project. Another obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire state building had to to with nature itself. Because the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting the back of the ship wald swivel around the mooring mast which was very unsafe. The laws against airships flying too low over urban areas also proved to be an obstacle because the Ships would never be able to actually approach the area. In conclusion, the builders faced many obstacles during construction for the dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
5356	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. So that was an obstacle because if the workers were up there working with that it would have to of been a very dificult situation and chalenging to work on the building with it like that. Another obstacle I would have to say would be the wind pressure they had when the thouand-foot dirigible was only hung on by a single cable that must of been a difficult obstacle with the wind blowing hard. Over sixty thousand dollers' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work must have been a challenging obstacle because they had to do alot of work that would take a while to get done if it has all over sixty thousand dollers' worth of work they had to do @CAPS1 on the frame work.	1	2		2																					
5357	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the readers learn that there are obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the readers learn that the architects are worried about the load of the blimp and the wind pressure that is transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The architects would have to strengthen and modify the Empire State Building for it to be accustomed to this new situation. The architects also saw problems with foreign dirigibles which use hydrogen rather than helium as said in paragraph @NUM2, ""Most dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" One of the biggest obstacle was how the winds on top of the building were always shifting so even if the dirigible is tethered to the mast, the back would still swivel around. Later on, the architects idea for a mooring mast disapperead and it was then used for observation."	3	3		3																					
5364	6	"Despite Al Smith's goal of fulfilling the ""dream of aviation pioneers,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such problem that the builders faced was the stress a dirigible would add to the building itself; by mooring a large dirigible to the building by a single cable tether, the building would have to be able to withstand the stress of the dirigible itself and the wind pressure that would be transmitted throughout the entire building. Thus, the builders were forced to strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building with over @MONEY1 of modifications. In addition, dirigibles from outside the United States posed as a danger hazard due to most of them being filled with highly flamable hydrogen. When the German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it became obvious of the risks of such an accident above a densely populated city of New York. Not only that, but the raging winds on top of the Empire State Building also posed a problem as even when tethered to the mooring mast, the rear of the ship would continually sway around the mooring mast; this proved to be a danger hazard with the citizens of New York directly below it. Furthermore, there was an established law prohibiting airships from flying to low over urban areas; this made it illegal for a dirigible to tether itself to the Empire State Building and further cemented the impossibility for the builders in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4		4																					
5365	6	"In @PERSON1's excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although dirigibles were a modern form of transportation they were highly dangerous. As it states in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen in highly flammable."" This along with the ""violent air currents"" as stated in paragraph @NUM2, were two of the risks that the builders had to take into consideration. The builders needed to converse the idea of a safe way in which dirigibles could dock there insuring that no one gets hurt. Another obstacle the builders had to take into consideration was the law passed in which was, ""against airships flying to low over urban areas,"" as explained in paragraph @NUM3. The excerpt clearly explains the complications the builders had to endure and take into thought when constructing the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building underwent many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
5366	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest obstacle the builders had to overcome was the winds were constantly changing because of the air currents. Another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock on the empire state building was because many dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION3 used Hydrogen which is very flammable. So if one blew up like it did in Lakehurst, New Jersey more people would be effected by it. Yet another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed to dock there is because they could use lead weights to weigh down the back of the blimp because that would be dangerous for the people below Another reason why dirigibles weren't allowed is because of the sharp spires of the other buildings in the area. If a Navy captain was afraid of having his blimp poped then no one should be allowed. The last reason was that there was a law saying that air ships can't fly too low over urban Areas. Those with the obstacles the builders could never overcome."	4	4		4																					
5367	6	There are many obstacles that the builders face when creating the empire state building.  First off the height of the building more come into question as much and there were to many discussions about the Top of the building.  The empire state buildings first goal was to be the future of city they wanted to food people onto blimp.  another problem is where really is know way to get the blimp steady enough to stick to the building and the large aircrafts are not suppose to fly back close to the building because other building are around.  In conclusion, they did face many problems.	0	2		1																					
5370	6	There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building had to face while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason is the dirigibles were unsafe. This is because dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, which is extremely flammable. If the dirigible caught on fire in a densely populated place, then many people could die from it. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature itself. This is because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting so the back of the dirigible would swivel back and forth. They could only fix the problem by putting weights on the back of the ship, but to do that impractical and unsafe. This is because the weights are dangling high above pedestrians, so if one broke, it could kill someone. The third obstacle is that there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for the ships tie up to the building. The final obstacle was the wind could have pushed the ship onto sharp spires, which could puncture the ship, so the pilots wouldn't be able to get the mooring equipment. These are the obstacles the builders face, which caused the mooring equipment not to be installed.	4	3		4																					
5372	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, many obstacles of building the Empire State building as a docking station for dirigibles are describle. John Tauranac, the man who came up with the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the empire state building forgot some very important things to take into account. First the entire building would have to be modified because ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stres to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The second problem that would need to be solved would be the safety of the city. Many ""dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM2.). If an accident like German dirigible Hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse. Lastly, the ""violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM3) would pose as one of the greatest obstacles. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to tie up but could not get close enough because of ""forceful wind."" (paragraph @NUM4). The obstacles of making the empire state building into a mooring mast caused too many obstacles that could not be solved."	3	3		3																					
5373	6	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of a building had never been done before. They had to add over sixty thousand dollars worth of framework before they could even begin building the mast. Then, once the mast was designed, and the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the mast could begin to be framed.	1	1		1																					
5376	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the excerpt tells the reader of a huge issue. It states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame."" Due to this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Another set back is in paragraph @NUM2. It states, ""The greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" Due to violent air current, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Tethering the mooring mast would do little help. Lead weights could not be used. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""dangling weights high above pedestrians..., was neighter practical nor safe."" All of these obstacles showed architects, the project at that time was impossible."	3	3		2																					
5378	6	"The builders of the empire state building encountered many obstacles. These obstacles were not easily fixed. First, the steel frame of the empire state building had to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the ""new situation."" Another obstacle was safety. Having an accident would be detrimental to many peoples' lives, because it is located in such a densely populated area. Also the winds made the whole thing very dangerous. Lastly there was an existing law saying that airships could not fly too low over urban areas."	3	2		3																					
5379	6	"The obstacles that the builders @CAPS1 in attempting to allow dirigibles is making its speed go up. Another obstacle that the builders @CAPS1 is the landing area. The last obstacle that the builders @CAPS1 is making sure that the passengers get on and off safely. Like it says on paragraph six, ""passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank..."""	1	1		1																					
5380	6	"There were plenty of problems engineers at the empire state building faced when they wanted to dock dirigibles. Well for starters, the winds up that high were over-powering, as it says in paragraph @NUM1 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also there was the dirigibles themselfs that caused a problem For they were filled with hydrogen, which is very flamable, One other problem was air laws they state that dirigibles, in urban areas, were not to fly too low. It is because of these problems that destroyed Al Smith's Idea that building could dock airships."	3	3		3																					
5383	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. One of which being that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used Hydrogen to float, making them very flammable and unsafe. If a blimp were to be damaged over New York, many people could be hurt. Also, nature itself made docking extremely difficult. Winds made the blimps very unstable. If one were tied to the mast, winds could wrap the line around the mast. Another obstacle was the existing law that prohibited aircrafts from flying that low over urban areas. This made it illegal for any ship to even approach the mast.	2	3		3																					
5384	6	Al Smith and his team of builders faced several obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. The first problem with docking dirigibles is that the steel frame and foundation could not support The stress put on it by a dirigible attached to it. Also, when the builders looked back on past dirigible accidents like the Hindenburg, they realized that if an accident were to occur, many lives would be at stake. Furthermore, there were laws that limited how low a dirigible could fly over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building because it would be too low. Finally, and according to the builders, most importantly, the largest problem with docking dirigibles to the Empire State Building was mother nature. Winds at the top of the building were very high and changed unpredictably, effectively turning the dirigible docked into a disaster waiting to happen.	3	3		3																					
5388	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the thousand foot dirigible would attach to the buildings by a single cable, adding stress to the frame of the building. The builders were forced to modify and strengthen the foundation to address the issue of stability. similarly, builders had to deal with the issue of wind pressure which were constantly shifing at heights of over @NUM1 feet in the air. The load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit pressure and stress onto the buildings foundation. This was a high safety concern, and pivotal to the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the empire state building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders faced significant obstacles such as building weakness, safety, and law enforcement, that made attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State's mooring mast, virtually impossible.	3	3		3																					
5389	6	"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith wanted to add a ""top"" or a ""hat"" to the Empire State Building that would function as a docking station for dirigibles. The dream was not ment to be.The first of many problems was getting the mooring mast, docking station, on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" A dirigible would only be held by one cable.The dirigible's load and the wind presure would have to be transmitted all the way down the building. There were also safety problems. A lot of dirigibles used hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable. It is also very windy around the Empire State Building. The dirigibles would have to hang sandbags by ropes. These would hang above the people below. The mooring mast was a good idea, but the builders faced to many problems. The project was never completed."	3	3		3																					
5391	6	In this excerpt, the builders faced many obstacles with the Empire State Building in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of those problems included weather, height, and the gases used to to fuel the dirigible. The weather was a tough force to beat. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building, the wind at that height was more extreme, and could cause the dirigible to swerve. The next contributing factor was height. In the excerpt, it stated that law ordered a limit. If the dirigibles were too low to urban areas, it would be unsafe. At any moment something could cause the dirigible to fall and crash on buildings and pedestrians. The last obstacle is the type of gas used. Apparently hydrogen is highly flammable compared to helium. Which could also cause harm to the passengers. In conclusion, weather, height, and the type of gas used, were all among the many obstacles that the Empire State Building would face when allowing dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																					
5393	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon lusted theres alot of problems when trying to add a dock for dirigibles at the top. One problem or obstacle was the safety of the dirigible itself, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" (@NUM1). Another obstacle was nature itself, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2). The last problem was the existing law aganist airships flying too low over cities or urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (@NUM3). These are three reasons why in the excerpt ""The mooring @CAPS1"" by marcia Amidon lusted that there were alot of problems when trying to add a dock for drigibles."	3	3		3																					
5396	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained why there is a landing area on the Empire State Building called the Mooring Mast. The first obstacle the workers faced was there was no Landing space on the top of the Empire State Building. This means dirigibles could @CAPS4 at all. To fix the problem of not having a Landing area is, they would add the Mooring Mast. The Mooring Mast was built with wenches that would hold the dirigibles but it would put too much stress on the building. The workers used a @CAPS2 of money to make the building so it wasn't stressed when the dirigibles was held to the Mooring Mast. After all that got fixed they forgot one thing, the wind. The wind was so violent that the dirigible couldn't maneuver. to get on top of the Empire State Building. When the workers figured that out they gave up. Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 explained what the workers tried to do to get a dirigible to @CAPS4 on the Empire State Building in the excerpt The Mooring Mast.	2	3		2																					
5399	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obsticales in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem with the height and alltitude of the Zeppelin. Even if they docked, the back of it would be moving around everywhere from the wind. Another reason was that on May 6, 1937 the Hindenburg was burned to the ground after takeoff. witch means that it was very flamable from using hydrogen instead of helium. All raised safty issues that needed to be sought out.	2	2		2																					
5401	6	"The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. One was that they had find away that would not make the building to unstable ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" Another obstacles was the winds would be too strong and not safe for the dirigible to be up there ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A third example would be that it was too dangerous to have the dirigible up there because the gases with in were extremely flamible ""most dirigibles from outside of the united states used Hydrogen... and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" The final obstacles the builders would have to face was that there is a law that does not allow airships to come to close to the ground in urban areas. So in conclution we can see that even though it was a good idea to port dirigible is was not a practical one."	4	3		4																					
5408	6	"Although the idea for turning the mast at the top of the Empire State building into a docking area for dirigibles was a highly clever idea, it was not a very safe one at all. One ""reason why dirigibles could not moor the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law left the idea of the mast as a failure before construction even began, but the workers failed to notice this law. Another obstacle that added difficulty to the construction was how much pressure having the dirigibles moored to the building added to the base of the building. This caused another @MONEY1 to be spent trying to fix this problem. A third factor that made the idea of setting up a mast even more difficult came straight from nature itself. The winds that high off the ground made manuvering the dirigible in such a small space very difficult. This was proven when ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy Dirigible' Los Angeles' approach the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."	3	3		3																					
5409	6	There are many things in life that seem like they could be brilliant ideas but, in reality there are many flaws with it. One of these ideas is using the Empire State building as a mooring mast for dirigibles. This is what Al Smith, the governor of New York at the time, discovers in an excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted. In this excerpt the builders of the Empire State building had to face some serious obstacles to allow the docking of dirigibles: @CAPS1 building the Empire State building many of the blue prints had to be changed. One thing that had to be changed was the skeleton of the building. They needed a way to support the drigibles if they were to dock. The skeleton they had in place put too much stress on the top half of the building that it would result in breaking. Another thing that the builders had to deal with was the safety of the @LOCATION1. If the highly flamable helium inside the dirigibles then it would be putting thousands of peoples lives in jeopardy. Finally the builders had to deal with the violently shifting winds. This too put stress on the frame of the building since the winds were so strong there and also a fear that it would blow the blimp into the pointed mast and break the blimp. Overall there are many reasons why the Mooring Mast never became a reality.	3	2		3																					
5410	6	The idea of docking dirigables on top of The Empire State Building was a grand one It seems as though the dream of dirigable transportation was on it's way up, however, the architects were blinded by their excitement. Al @CAPS1 competitive nature not only pushed the building to a un-precedented 1,250 ft., but also combined transportation in new, fashionable, And effective ways. This not only made the public and architects excited, but also put a lot of expectations on the building. Al Smith did not see all the obstacles ahead that would halt his dirigible plans. One of the obstacles being that the swaying of the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building, though the necessary precautions were made, the obstacle was foreshadowing the others to come. When the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the hydrogen gas, people became skepticle. What if it were to blowup over a crowded New York city street? Also, an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas prohibited the dirigable plans. The obstacles proved too much for the plan to go through. Though the plans were merely postponed by the late 1930's the idea of dirigables a top the Empire State Building had disappeared.	3	3		3																					
5413	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were wheather. Nature itself would ruin the time frame of building. Winds would shift, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.Another challenge the builders ran into was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.	2	2		2																					
5416	6	"Throughout the passage, the builders were faced with many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Al Smith had the idea to have dirigibles be a new form of transportation. The idea sounded great with the dirigibles moving at a rate of seventy five miles per hour and moving thousands of feet without needing to be refuled. Anxious, Al smith was very unsure of when the would all be done, saying, ""it's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" It would just not be possible for the architect to drop the huge mooring mass on top of the buildings flat roof. Another problem would be the violent wind currents. The fate of the dirigible had faded out. Airplanes became more suitable to passengers then dirigibles."	1	2		2																					
5417	6	Based on the excerpt I just read these are some of the obstacles that the @ORGANIZATION1 one of the obstacles was the balloon becuz it had hellem and it was also flame abou. The secton obstacles is that you cantroll the balloon and the threed obstacles The Empire State Building had was a flat roof. and these are the obstacles that the @ORGANIZATION1.	1	1		1																					
5419	6	"Dirigibles also known today as Blimps used to dock at the empire state building. The Empire State building was used as a docking ground for dirigibles (which are enormous steel formed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium, which made them lighter then air). They had a top speed of @NUM1 mph for thousands of miles. ""Al Smith saw an opportunity for the empire state building: A moor added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor their for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" As stated in the excerpt. The dirigibles were docked by an electric winch which stopped the big balloon from going anywhere and tied it to the mast. Al Smith was successful when building moore cause it was good for dirigibles."	0	0		0																					
5421	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" many of the builders faced obstacles for attempting dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. Many of the reasons had to do with safety. Although the idea to dock dirigibles to the building sounded good many things could of gone wrong. The Empire State building was a enormous structure for it's time, even though it looked ideal for the mast to go on ""winds""  would be too dangerous for even the most skilled pilots to menuver the dirigibles. Also most of the dirigibles from other countrys such as @LOCATION2 used ""hydrogen"" in their blimps. Although the dirigibles were ""hailed"" as the transportation of the future, too many safety precautions had to be taken because of the densely populated area of New York City. For the dirigibles at the time they were a sound and good idea for transportation, but even though the structure of the Empire State building lookd good they still had to be care ful with the building and the people below, and for the German hydrogen filled blimps were not good terms of safety over a populated city."	3	3		3																					
5425	6	The Top of the Empire State Building would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid but there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask.	0	0		0

5431	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to let dirigibles dock there. One obstacle they faced was that the building's frame would have to be modified. This was because the dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building when docked on it. These modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced was that it would be too difficult to keep the dirigibles still. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This made it dangerous for passengers as well as pedestrians on the street and prevented the dirigible from getting close enough to tie up. A third obstacle the builders faced was that there was an existing law that said airships could not fly too low over urban areas because it was very dangerous. Although it seemed like a good idea, there were too many obstacles and dangers involved in letting dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
5433	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. So in order to strengthen the frame it would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another challenge was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure. The last obstacle was safety because of an accident took place in downtown New York it would be devastating.	2	2		2																					
5434	6	"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders faced was safety.  In paragraph @NUM1, it was said that ""most dirigibles from outside of the @CAPS2 used hydrogen rather than helium"", now hydrogen is highly flammable. In paragraph @NUM2, it states that ""if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"", now thats niether practical nor safe. If the ship is tied, the back should be stable. The last obstacle that the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low. In paragraph @NUM3, it applies that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Though some ships did attempt to reach the building, there was no success in that."	3	2		3																					
5435	6	"When the idea of making a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building was thought of, builders did not realize the obstacles that would have to be passed. One obstacle was ""nature itself. The winds, on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This means that if a dirigible were to be tied up for loading and unloading, it could be moved around freely in the sky, making it dangerous for passengers to be on or around it. An example of the dangerous winds would be in 1930, the ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. A concern for safety was that ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If something wrong were to happen, there could be great consequences for the heavily populated downtown of @LOCATION2. A third and final obstacle that occurred was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

Because of these obstacles, the idea to have dirigibles dock at the top of the Empire State Building seemed impossible, and was never accomplished."	4	3		4																					
5436	6	Now, people know what a ludacris idea it was to have dirigibles dock on top of the Empire State Building; however, in the @DATE1's and @NUM1's people were oblivious to the idea many failures and the obstacles the builders would face. One obstacle that was faced was that most of these dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, which is extremely flammable and put the city at risk. Another obstacle was nature, due to the winds on top of the Empire State Building it was hard to bring the dirigibles remotely close to the mast. Yet another obstacle facing the builders of the mast was a law that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas like New York City. Overall, the idea could not be projected into a real-life, visual interpretation because of the obstacles faced by the builders of the mast, now people have airplanes and airports to dock the planes - theres no use for the mast on top of the Empire State Building regarding aviation.	3	3		3																					
5437	6	"Builders had to face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle is that it is unsafe to have it dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians.

This would mean that if a docked dirigible filled with hydrogen were to catch on fire it would burn down the Empire State Building and much of the city, killing many people with its explosion. Another main obstacle As stated in paragraph @NUM2 was nature ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". These winds would make it almost impossible for a dirigible to reach the mast and actually dock. In addition the dirigible would be swinging around violently once it was tied to the mast The third major problem was the law against aircraft flying low over urban areas as stated in paragraph @NUM3 ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". With the law in the way no one would even want to try. Those are the three major problems found when building the mast"	4	3		4																					
5441	6	"The empire state building builders had to face hard obstacles by.... ""accommodating passengers,"" new routes, and the greatest obstacle was to nature itself. By accommodating the passengers they had to bring them to the existing transatlantic routes. This was because the new routes weren't made yet. Reasoning being is because the building needed to be more taller. So then they added more things on the top of it. They wanted the State Building to nature itself because the building @CAPS1 Shifting from ""violent air currents"". Also the dirigible was more open fields to the moor. The State building also was weight down by the lead weights."	1	1		1																					
5442	6	There are a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the violently changing wind currents at the height the docking to place. This would move the blimp and possibly send it into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. Dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself. It would disrupt the frame and possibly effect the building as a whole. Also most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable as seen in the Hindenburg disaster. Due to all these reasons the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp.	3	3		3																					
5444	6	"When building the Empire State Building, builders were faced with several obstacles in their attempts to have dirigibles dock there. The builders first had to ensure that the building was going to be able to support the dirigible. After they completed this issues relating to safety arose. It was very dangerous to because some air ballons were made out of hydrogen which were flammable. If their were any issues, New York's population could be in grave danger. The wind also was an issue ... because it was so shifty a dirigble would be heavy in the back. Dangling above new york was very dangerous. The last complications that affected the idea of docking the drigbles was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban area."" because of the law, safety and nature complications, builders were never able to successfully reach their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
5447	6	Some of the Problems they faced building the emPire State building was the hight. building a buildig that high up and also epecting it to do things such as bording dirigibles. The @CAPS1 of the dirigible against the building could couse it to collapes. thats why The contractor to to re shape the Skeleton of the building.	1	1		1																					
5451	6	The Empire state building faced several major problems in making a station for diridgibles to dock. One is, that at that time there was a law prohibiting airships of any kind landing/docking in a residential area, never mind a densely populated city. There will were also many issues with practicalities with the mast, if it was even constructed. It would have been a huge hassle to get the huge airships docked, and keeping them there, never mind the extremely flammible hydrogen gas zeppelins were often filled with.	2	2		2																					
5452	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was for many differents reasons. One of them is the wether, ""the greatest obstacle to sucessful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The second one is that they have a law aganist airships, ""was an existing law aganist airships flying too low over urban areas"". The also have have the problem is that the dirigible will be dangling high above people reads, ""...they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"". This is some of the problems that they have."	3	3		3																					
5453	6	"The builders of the empire state building had to face the obstacle of safety, to make sure everyone can get on the dirigible safely without any form of danger. Another obstacle is arranging the dirigibles so that they are able to board passengers from there. @PERSON1 said ""the height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gears."" People did'nt want to try it, so that would be another obstacle. If people did'nt want to try it then it will become just a decoration, and that's not what Al Smith wanted. Last obstacle would be that it would'nt hold for long as said in the excerpt ""The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" In other words, the architects did'nt think to far a head into the future to see if the mooring mast would even be used. These are some of the obstacles that the builders had to face."	0	2		0																					
5454	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while constructing a mast that would make it possible for dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of all was nature itself. It was unrealistic to have a dirigible tied by a single cable tether to remain intact when the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mast which was hazardous for pedestrians. There was nothing the builders could do to alter nature so their ideas soon became unrealistic. Another obstacle the builders faced while constructing the building was that the dirigible's weight would add to much stress (especially with added wind pressure) to the building's frame. They then decided the only way to fix that problem was to shift the weight to the building's foundation.	3	3		3																					
5455	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was attaching a mooring mast to the top of the building. Because of the height of the Empire State Building, they were unable to just drop the mast onto the roof for would have interfered with the buildings overall frame. In order to keep the mooring mast atop the roof, the architects spent thousands of dollars on modifying the framework of the building. Another obstacle for the docking of diribles was the preservation of the safety of the public below. Dirigibles were inflated with highly flammable hydrogen, creating the risk of a massive explosion over New York and endangering countless lives. Lastly, a very important obstacle for the builders was the danger of nature. Violent air currents filled the winds above and around the Empire State Building. Even if a dirigible were strung to the roof, the back of the ship would continue to swivel, causing even more danger to citizens below the building. Those were some obstacles that builders faced and prevented to making of a mooring mast to let dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.	4	3		4																					
5457	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems while trying to allow the dirigibles to dock there. They couldn't just allow the dirigibles to land on the buildings flat roof, because it weighed too much and would add stress to the buildings frame.The plan never followed through for a few reasons. A big issue was safety. The dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The highly flammable substance was too dangerous to use above New York. The greatest issue was the wind. It was always changing because of air currents. The dirigible could be tethered down, but it would be floating in the air above pedestrians. The plan to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to allow dirigibles to dock their was a failure.	2	3		3																					
5459	6	During the Building of the Mast, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 obstacle was the building itself. By adding the mast lots of stress would be added to the buildings frame and therefore strengthening modifications had to take place before the mast was erected. Another problem was how to tether the Blimp properly since they are generally landed in wide open fields which allowed for wieghts to be place in the front and back of the blimp, they could be secured properly. But since the blimp was going to be attached to a mast, there was no way to secure the back of the blimp and therefore no safe way to tie the blimp down. And finally the last problem builders faced was the how to even get the blimp docked. Since there was such high winds on top of the building there was no feasible way to dock the blimp in less it was perfect weather. Ultimately all those problems made it so the mast could never be used.	3	3		3																					
5461	6	Te obstacles that the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the dirigibles would add stress to the frame of the building, The steel frame of the empire State Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this situation, over Sixty thousand dollars were needed to moderate the @CAPS1 Of the building, The greatest Obstacle was nature itself because the winds on the top of the building were Constantly Shifting due to violent Air currents. This were some of the obstacles to the builders of the empire state builders to attempt to allow dirigibles dock there.	2	2		2																					
5462	6	"The obstacles that builders faced in making the Empire State Building a docking point reached the greatest problems. Obstacles come in all forms, depending on the size of the goal. The goal's size was immense so the range was in its greatest. The problems were law, nature, safety, and the point of docking.Firstly, the main problem was the location. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" This would have not only tore down the entire building but send it crashing down onto pedestrians within the range of eleven hundred feet it the direction it was hauled. Secondly, instead of helium, dirigibles used hydrogen instead, ""and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This put a safety issue, especially over a highly populated urban area, like New York. Thirdly, the building was so high, it intercepted higher forces of wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could have made a dirigibles strain against the building or fresh against the mooring point. Lastly, law prevented all ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" As high as the Empire State Building was it was too close the public.Overall, the builders were impacient and that created obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. They made the goal so large, it caused the obstacles to reach their range of difficulty. The purpose of the Empire State Building may be a failure, but it still is the tallest building constructed."	3	3		3																					
5463	6	"In the short story, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when building the mask. The entire steel frame of the Building would have had to be strengthened to hold the weight of the mast. The mast, which towered at over @NUM1 feet tall, would have stressed the steel frame of the Building, making its foundation weaker. To hold the mast, ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" This meant that the builders had to really think through the process of how they were going to get the mast to not bend the steel frame. Another obstacle the builders faced was a new law that forbid airships from flying too low over urban areas, such as New York. Therefore, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the Building or even approach the area. ""Because of this law, the mast was very rarely used. Regardless of what they tried, the builders would have to make big changes to the Empire State Building's framework in order to have the mast. However, the new law prevented airships from docking there, so the mast was not used as often as originally projected. The mast did help make the Empire State Building the largest building in the world at 1,250 feet, but it forced strengthening and fixing of the building's framework, and the mask was not used as much as the builders thought."	3	4		4																					
5465	6	When the Empire State building was built the workers were trying to find new ways to @CAPS1 the structure. They had sudently had found some problems with one being the top of the empire state building.      Workers had tryed to figure out hwo they were going to but a Dirigibles on top of the building so that they could be able to pick up people and to drop them off up there but there were different problems.	1	1		1																					
5467	6	In order for the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles (blimps), many obstacles had to be overcome by the architects. One of those obstacles was the Empire State Building's frame. If a thousand-foot dirigible was moored on top of the building with just a single cable tether, it would add tremendous stress to the foundation of the building due to the dirigibles load and wind pressure. Another obstacle that the architects faced was safety. Because dirigibles in the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium, there was a high risk of the dirigible exploding, and threatening the dense population of downtown New York City. Possibly the greatest obstacle that the architects had to face was high winds. On top of the Empire State Building, the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if lead weights could be used to weigh down and control the docked dirigible, they would still be unsafely dangling about the pedestrians of the streets below. Those are some obstacles that the architects of the Empire State Building faced in an attempt to dock dirigibles.	4	4		4																					
5469	6	"Ambitious for its time, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was doomed from the start.  The engineers and builders of the mooring mast were faced with many obstacles that could potentially inhibit safe docking at the top of the building. The first major obstacle was finding a way to tether the dirigible to the dock. As described in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held on by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame.""  Modifications would have to be made to the entire building.  Another obstacle the engineers were faced with was stabilizing the dirigible once it was tethered to the building.  As described in paragraph @NUM2, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would make it nearly impossible for passengers and crew to get on or off the dirigible.  These obstacles, baffled engineers and builders of the Empire State Building until the project was abandoned entirely."	3	3		3																					
5473	6	There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A practical reason why was a law against airships flying too close over urban areas like New York. The law would make it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the building. The greater reason was the issue of safety. If a ship came in to dock with use of hydrogen (a highly flammable gas), an explosion is possible, harming everyone bellow.The greatest obstacle were the shifting winds from air currents. Even if tethered down, the ship would swivel around the tower getting tangled. In conclusion, the idea had to be dropt, though some ships have tried to dock their.	3	3		3																					
5475	6	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. So Al Smith thought putting a mooring mast at the top of the building, would allow dirigibles to dock there several hours. It would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off. Another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored. It would be held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. Third obstacle would be using hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen it is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																					
5476	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted talks about The Mooring Mast or also known as the Empire State Building of how it was built and the original purposes of the building. During the making of the Empire State Building, builders faced issues in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there such as architectural problems, different gases, and the law. The builders faced a problem with the architect of building. The roof top was a flat as it says ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" That meant the heavy dirigible would add stress to the building's frame Another issue they faced was the gas some dirigible used @CAPS1 dirigibles were filled with different gases and ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It meant that the building could catch on fire and whole downtown New York. They also faced an issue with the law saying ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". It explains it would be illegal to tie a dirigible on the building"	3	3		3																					
5479	6	"The idea to put a mast on top of the empire building @CAPS1 like a brilliant idea. People thought it would be a great idea to dock a dirigible on the mast, expecially because ""New york city was the lack of Suitable landing areas."" But it is easy to @CAPS2 how the mooring mast would never be able to dock drigibles. One reason this could never happen is because @CAPS3 of these drigibles contained hydrogen in them wich is highly flammable. ""When the german dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lakehurst, New Jersey.... the empire State building realized how much worst that accident could have been."" @CAPS3 people would die if this happened over a highly populated area. Another reason that the mast would never be able to be used is because there was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low or over urban areas."" @CAPS4 even if everything was Set up correctly they would be breaking the law flying there dirigibles @CAPS4 close to the city. But the most obvious reason is that the weather would be to unpredictable above the empire State building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due violent air currents."" The mooring mast would just be a tottally unstable place to dock these drigibles."	3	3		3																					
5482	6	When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world's tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at forty-second  Street. and lexington Avenue in New York. The top of the Empire State Building be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid. The age of dirigibles. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Once the archietects had designed the mooring Mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton.	1	2		2																					
5483	6	The obstacles the builders fact was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The Steel Frame of the Empire state Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The greatest reason was safety: most dirigibles from outside of the united states used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. existing law against airships flying too low.	3	3		3																					
5489	6	"The task of trying to allow dirigibles to dock 1,250 ft. above round over the city of New York not shockingly posted a few obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building.Before the dirigibles could even try to dock on the mast, the builders had to modify the whole building due to the stress and pressure on the building from the dirigibles. The modifications cost over sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the building once the builders finally had all the modifications and building done; they were faced with a whole new set of obstacles. Most of the dirigibles from out of the united states were filled with flammable hydrogen. ""The german dirigible @CAPS1 was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION3, New Jersey"". This accident worried @CAPS2. Also they faced problems with the shifting winds and air currents that made it difficult to dock the dirigibles. Another obstacle was the fact that laws existed against airships flying too low to the ground. Due to these unforeseen obstacles, the idea of docking on top of the building disappeared."	3	3		3																					
5490	6	Based on the information given in the excerpt, there are multiple obstacles they couldn't have been overcome by the builders of the empire state building. Between the winds, problems with ancoring, risk of Fire and sharp spires, there were also legal issues that would first have to be bested.One thing the builders of the Empire State building hadn't considered was the wind current. Because the dirigibles were primarilly huge propelled balloons, the wind could push them around, and at 1,250 Feet, there isn't very much around to slow or block the wind. They also didn't think about the @CAPS1 that hydrogen, a key gas involved with lifting dirigibles, was very Flammable and if one was to ascend in @CAPS2, dozens or maybe even hundreds of people bellow would be doomed.More problems the architects face were the sharp spires atop many of the buildings around. If a pilot were to lose control of the bimp, then it would cause @MONEY1 of damage to the city.Lastly, a new law was undergoing a legislation process. It prohibited the flying of any air travel bellow a certain Feet in residential areas.	2	4		3																					
5493	6	When building a structer as big as the Empire state building and even having it dock a Dirigible to the top of it means there will be challenges to face. In order for It dock. The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The building would have to be @CAPS1. All these problems must be taken into consideration. This would mean spending more money	1	1		1																					
5500	6	"Various obstacles came up in this excerpt. This building of the mooring mast simply went from a dream to more of a way to win a record for the world's tallest building. The greatest obstacle they faced was the issue of safety. In paragraph @NUM1 it reads ""Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, an obstacle faced was the danger of the dirigible being destroyed by fire while trying to dock on the Empire State Building which would cause a large amount of destruction in New York. The builders, also faced the problem of nature itself. The violent air currents at these heights would cause the dirigible to swerve around the mooring mast. The builders also faced a legal issue stating in paragraph @NUM2 ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". @CAPS1, the dirigibles were never going to be allowed to fly so close to the Empire State Building anyway. These were the obstacles faced by the builders."	4	3		4																					
5505	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced law against airships flying to low over urban areas This law made it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building, fearing That The Wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in that area. That would harm the dirigible's shall Then another dirigible attempted a Publicity stunt, when it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspaper to the Empire state building. The Idea of The mooring was shelved. They yet unsolved Problems of mooring air ships to a fixed Mast at Such a height made it desirable. The highest open observatory dock, intended for disembarking Passengers, has never been open to The Public.	2	1		2																					
5508	6	The builders of the empire State building were faced with many different obstacles. One was the empire State building it @CAPS1. It is one of the tallest buildings in the world so only construction plan that goes wrong could be trajic for all the people below. When the started Construction on the mooring mast they knew there was Some risk but didn't think it threw. See all this was introduced because Al Smith wanted the Empire state to be the biggest. Now he didnt @CAPS2 look into it if a blimp was to @CAPS3 on the mooring mast they would have to worry about weather, wind, and also the strength of the buildings foundation. Also they would have to worry about the blimp it @CAPS1 back then dirigibles were filled with hydrogen and if Something was to go wrong ever downtown New York and the blimp was to catch a spark it would burn four city blocks	2	2		2																					
5509	6	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced many Problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the problems are some blimps are filled with hydrogen wich is highly flammable. If a blimp with hydrogen in it exploded over @LOCATION1 that would not turn out so good For people in New York City. Those people could die. Also one one blimp exploded in New Jersey the blimp had hydrogen in it. So when that happened they thought a lot about the docking station and only to allow blimps with helium in them to dock there.	2	1		2																					
5515	6	"The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted explains the plans for adding a mast to the top of the Empire State Building that would have been able to anchor blimps to the top of it. This idea was very complex; however, architects of time (@DATE1's) believed that it was quite possible. What they didn't seem to realize was just how many problems and obstacles there were to get in the way of the mast's success. One minor set back was that the mast (and the blimp attached to it) would add great amounts of stress to the frame of the building. This problem was taken care of with little stress by simply modifying in strengthening the building's foundation and frame. The largest obstacle standing in the way of the mast's success was the heavy winds at the top of the building, which were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". However, the absolute greatest issue that was faced was safety of the public. Most foreign blimps at the time were filled with highly flammable gas, which was ultimately why the mooring mast was never a success."	3	3		3																					
5517	6	The obstacles; the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there were highly challenging. They delt with the frames and shapes, but theres other reasons that are not so physical.One of the greatest obstacles they faced to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was nature itself. At the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Using the Empire state Building, where the blimps would be dangling high about pedestrians on the lower level of the street, was not safe.Another particular obstacle they faced was; an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This law made it illigal to ever tie up the blimp to the Empire State building itself. The blimps couldnt lad on the flat roof of the Empire state building. The builders of the Empire State Building had alot of obstacles in front of them. Not just physical objects to make it easier for the dirigibles to land, but the @CAPS1 of politics and nature aswell.	3	3		3

5521	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before construction ever took place. The main reason for this was safety. First, there was a chance that it could catch on fire. For example, most dirigibles are made of hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. They relized how much damage it could do if it caught on fire in a densely populated area, such as downtown New York. Secondly, they had another obstacle to the successful use of the mooring that was nature itself. For example, the wind on top of the building was constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Lastly dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building because they was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it. Instead of becoming the transportation of the future the idea had disappeared. They faced to many obstacles that could not be overcome."	3	4		3																					
5524	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles trying to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. Lack of a suitable landing area was a tough obstacle. It is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas. It would be dangling high above people and it wouldn't be safe. The way the dirigibles stays up in the air is it uses hydrogen instead of helium yet hydrogen is extremely flammable. To have a dock for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would not be safe and the builders would have to think of a new plan therefore, there would be many obstacles.	2	2		2																					
5525	6	During the @DATE1's technology and engineering wasn't quite as advanced. So it's safe to say builders of the Empire State Building had so obstacles. One of them were, how were they going to dock the dirigible safely and keep them stable, they had know idea. They did have the knowledge or technology to do such a thing back then.	1	0		1																					
5526	6	"There were many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One problem that was addressed was the fact that dirigibles all over the world were mostly filled with hydrogen, which was flammable. This was a problem because on May 6, 1937 a dirigible was destroyed by fire and the owners of the Empire State building relized ""how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place of a densely populated area."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Another potential problem were the strong wind currents on top of the building, as described in @CAPS1 @NUM2. The concern was that these strong currents would prevent a dirigible from docking, and could possibly blow it into another building. This could puncture the dirigible's material and cause a horrifying accident. The final obstacle that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building was the fact that it was against the law. The law stated that ""airships flying to low over urban areas"" was prohibited. There were many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking on the Empire State Building."	3	4		4																					
5529	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced obstacles in order to attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One issue was that the winds at the top of the building were very dramicaclly shifting because of the air currents. Because of this the Dirigible end would swivlle around the top of the building. An other issue was the people walking the @CAPS1 of New York below the building. To stop a Dirigible heavy lead weights had to be used. This was problamatic because one of the weights could very easily come lose and @DATE1. The law that was about a flying airship lingering too low over a city would be broken if a Dirigible had been stationd at the Empire State building.	3	3		3

At first, people thought it was going to be wonderful and lead to the ""transportation of the future"". One obstacle the builders faced was the fact that a large dirigible moored to the roof would have negative effects on the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". The builders would have to pay @MONEY1 to fix this problem. Another problem that was present was also the lack of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Also, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the violent winds would cause the back of the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Even if the back of the dirigibles were weighted down with lead, it would not be safe; as the lead would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low above urban areas.

As numerous problems became apparent after the building was finished, the idea of dirigibles being the ""future of transportation"" was dropped."	4	4		4																					
5532	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""the as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone"".

It is said that ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework,"" which could also be a cost problem. Secondly, building a mooring mast for dirigibles over densely populated New York City would be extremely unsafe. Dirigibles from foreign countries used hydrogen to keep them afloat, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 the Hindenburg disaster of 1937, any fires above heavily populated New York City would have disastrous effects. Next, the worst obstacle the builders faced was the winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS2 a one thousand foot long dirigible to the top of the Empire State Building would be very unsafe because the winds would blow the back of the dirigible, therefore swivelling the ship around the mast. The final obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even if the building of the mast was a success, the law against dirigibles coming too close would prevent the use of it. All these obstacles the builders faced led to the ultimate failure of the mast."	4	4		4																					
5538	6	When architects and engineers planned on building the mooring dock for blimps on the Empire State building they didn't realize all the problems that could happen. One of these problems was a big safety issue. Most blimps used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a blimp were to catch fire while on the Empire State, it would end in a disaster. Another obsticle was nature. The wind was unpredictable and the dirigibles would just be swinging in the wind. If the wind got to strong it could add a lot of stress to the building and it could colapse. One last reason was an actual law. The law stated it was illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. The mooring dock on the building would have never worked.	3	3		3																					
5542	6	"In the excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury."	3	3		3																					
5547	6	Many obstacles approached the builders of the Empire State Building as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders put reality before theory in order to pick the safest route in docking a dirigible. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in New Jersey, the builders realize how dangerous it could be putting that risk in such a densely populated area such as New York. The greatest obstacle in being able to dock safely was nature. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would sway the ship around the Mooring @CAPS1, becoming dangerous. The Mooring @CAPS1 project came to a hault in the late 1930s, in order to keep the people of downtown New York City safe.	3	3		3																					
5548	6	There are many reasons Why the builder's faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states that most dirigibles from outside of the United states use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The hydrogen can cause a fire and destroy the Empire State building and can destroy downtown New York. Another reason why the builder's faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is because it was against the law. In paragraph @NUM2 the exerpt states there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This could be dangerous to the citizens of downtown New York.	3	2		3																					
5551	6	"There were many obsticles the builders of  Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One obsticle was the buildings frame was not prepared for it. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" The frame of the building could not handle a docked dirigible. To fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have had to be made. Another obsticle faced by the builders was that most countries other than the United States use hydrogen instead of helium to make there dirigible fly. Hydrogen was very flammable and builders figured that if an accident like the Hindenburg occurred over a desely populated area like New York, it would be devastating. The greatest obsticle faced by the builders were the wind on top of the building that was constantly shifting. The shifting winds were caused by very violent air currats. While the digarble were tethered to the mast, the back of it would just keep spinning around in circles. They could not use lead weights to help hold the zeppelin steady because you can't just dangle heavy lead weights over New York City. From the beginning, the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was ridiculous."	3	3		3																					
5553	6	"The builders that were attempting to build a dock on the Empire State Building, had to face many obstacles. First, the girigibles were similar to huge ballons, @CAPS1 they were composed with hydrogen and helium. In the expert it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than, helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (pg @NUM1.) @CAPS1, if a dirigible caught on fire while it was stationed near the Empire State building, it may also catch the Empire State Building on fire. Resulting in a hazardous environment for the employees, and passengers.Next, attempting to tie down a dirigibles to a building, is known to be illegal. On the expert it states, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."". If anyone disobayed this law it may result in punishment; as a result, it would create a new obstacle the builders would have to deal with.Last but not least, the idea of docking airships to a building is extremely unsafe. ""The @CAPS2 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted gives an excellent third reason why airships are unsafe, ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" If a disaster ever took place, many lifes would have been lost or severely injuried. Finally, the builders and architect would have an extremely hard time convincing high government officials to allw air ships to dock on the empire state building, because the bad certainly over powers the good."	4	4		4																					
5555	6	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles. First, ""the lack of a suitable landing area"". They had to make room for the huge dirigibles to land. Second, ""add stress to the building's frame."" They had to make the structure of the building stronger so it wouldnt break. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" if they were going to be able to make this work they needed to find a way to calm the wind by the tower. Hence, In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles."	2	3		3																					
5557	6	"As the Empire State Building was being built to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there, the workers faced several problems in trying to accomplish this. The first of these obstacles to occurr to the workers was the framework of the building. The building needed to be sturdy enough for the blimp to dock there with the harsh winds constantly pushing the blimb in different directions. Without the proper frame work, it would be extremely dangerous to dock. The next obstacle for docking was the hydrogen gas powering the dirigibles. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and there had been other previous accidents with hydrogen blimps. The workers realized that an accident with exploding blimps would be very dangerous in a such ""densely populated area."" The final obstacle workers faced was the harsh wind currents at that altitude. The winds were so strong, that the blimps could not even get close enough to dock. The workers suggested weighting down the blimp would lead weights, but seeing as the weights ""would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"" it ""was neither practical nor safe."" Trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building seemed like a good idea. As time went on the obstacles preventing this became to great and finally shut down the idea. "	4	3		4																					
5560	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was lack of suitable landing area; ""so were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" Another obstacle was the wieght of a mooring mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened,"" which means they would have to modify the whole frame to bare the weight of the mooring mast which would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Safety was also an issue. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, so if it caught fire over a highly populated area such as downtown New York than the accident would be much worse. Another issue was the fact that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Because of the wind the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast."	3	4		3																					
5566	6	When constructing a building, workers will face tough obstacles, ecspecially when it comes to building the Empire State Building. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, Al Smith and other architectural builders faced many problems. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building because there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Also, as stated in paragraph @NUM2, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Both of these obstacles were reasons that explain the failure of the mooring mast. The builders were not successful at their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
5569	6	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast,"" many obstacles created problems for the builders of the Empire State building and their goal of allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle that came across the builder's minds was that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" (paragraph @NUM1) because it would damage the building with the ammount of pressure pulling on the structure. The second problem that the architects faced was safety. Events from the past such as Hindenburg was caused by the use of ""hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable...the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could've been."" The next problem that came up was nature itself, such as dangerous winds. An event when ""the U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 there were legal issues, and existing law was against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal."	4	4		4																					
5570	6	"The builders of the Empire state building faced the problem of how to keep the back end of the blimp from swaying in the wind. They were unable to solve this problem, as we see in paragraph @NUM1 where it says: ""Even if the derigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem with docking blimps on the Empire State building was a law that stopped dirigibles from flying too low over populated areas. There is proof of this in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" One more problem with mooring dirigibles on the Empire State was that it was hard for pilots to dock their ships on the mooring. An example of this is in paragraph @NUM2 where it says ""The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."""	3	3		3																					
5571	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Obstacles they faced were the strength of the framework, Safety of the dirigibles, @CAPS1 nature, and a law. The first obstacle, framework, wasn't too hard overcome, it cost @MONEY1 to strengthen it in order to support the mast and a blimp. The second obstacle was safety, on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire due to the highly flammable gas hydrogen which is used in dirigibles. This accedent could have been much worse if it occured above a highly populated area like New York. The third obstacle was @CAPS1 nature, the violent air currents on top of the Empire State Building made it close to impossible to dock a dirigible to the mast. By using led weights to weigh down the back of the blimp would be neither practical nor safe hanging high above pedestrians. The final and forth obstacle builders faced was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to even attempt docking to the mast.	4	3		4																					
5575	6	"There are many obstacles faced because of letting the dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building. First, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This means that the winds ontop of the building were strong and will cause the dirigible will swivel around the mooring mast, if tethered. Also, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the areas."" This shows that it was a waist of time thinking ships could moor at the State Building because there is a clear law against it. There still are many obstacles you have to over come for any project."	2	3		3																					
5577	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders faced while attempting to build the dirigible dock at the Empire State Building were: finding a way to make this building bigger than the Chrysler Building, Designing the mast and @CAPS1 the reality. Al Smith needed a way to make is building bigger than the Chrysler building. He came up with the idea with putting a mooring mast on the building. The idea seemed great. While designing the mast, architects realized they can't just place the mast right on top of the building. They'd have to modify the foundation. After changing the skeleton of the building, construction went on as planned. Two month later the mast was finished, but the architects forgot that most dirigibles use hydrogen which is highly flammable. All the work the architects put in was for nothing because the mooring mast was never used.	2	2		2																					
5578	6	There are always challenges when you are trying something inovative. There are obstacles like getting approval, gaining support and you also need to be structurally sound. Al Smith and the rest of these archetects faced all of these. During the 1920s dirigibles were supposed to be the future of travel. Al Smith wanted to be able to dock a dirigible on top of the Empire State building. Other than getting people to go along with the plan he had other problems. The wind is very violent at that altitude. Dirigibles were not supposed to fly that close to the city it is dangerous and some were highly flamable. In conclusion There were too many large obstacles to overcome.	2	2		2																					
5583	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main obstacle was that the builders couldn't @CAPS1 put the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, because it had a flat roof. The mooring mast would put pressure on the building's fram. To overcome this obstacle the architects had to modify and strengthen the frame. More than sixty thousand dollars' went into the modifications of the framework. The greatest obstacle though was nature, and there was nothing the builders could do about that. The violent air currents caused winds on the top of the building to constantly shift. In open fields dirigibles could be weighted down in the back using led weights, but with pedestrians around it wouldn't be practical nor safe. Without being weighted down the dirigibles would swivel around.	3	3		3																					
5586	6	The builders faced many obstacles by building the Empire State Building.One obstacle was that Al Smith had competition with the Chrysler building. Which was forty-six feet taller, than the Empire State. Which led to Smith making the State Building reach the height of 1,250 feet. This leads to another obstacle, he wanted to add a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. This didn't work due to lack of landing space. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would cause stress to the buildings frame.In conclusion I just explained the obstacles of the Empire State Building.	1	1		1																					
5588	6	The first obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lake of suitable landing area. Because some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City.The second was that there dirigibles had hydrogen in it and hydrogen was highly flammable. And the realized how much worst accident could have been if it had taken place in New York because this is where they were located. They had to re-think about they're plan. And another one was that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.	2	2		2																					
5589	6	"Builders of the empire state building faced challenging obstacles in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock their ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself"" This was a huge problem for the mooring masts because they could not get close enough to the building to land. The winds were too strong. Secondly, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" meaning that because there were so many people in a small area of downtown New York it was too dangerous for dirigibles and other aircrafts to be that low. Lastly dirigibles from outside of the state used hydrogen rather then helium ""hydrogen is highly flameable"" After the German Hindenburg had an accident with fire it was clear that taking the risk of an accident like that happen above the heads of thousands of pedestrians was a bad idea. The obstacles, which were noticed too late; before the construction, is why the dirigables are not allowed to land on the Empire State building to this day."	3	4		4																					
5590	6	"The obstacles that needed to be overcame, to create the idea of a docking platform on top of what was going to be announced as ""The tallest building,"" was going to be tough. The steps taken to make this idea come to life, began with consulting with experts. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION1 in New Jersey. When it was time to start constructing, the issue of the stress the building would intake from the mass of the Dirigibles became a problem. They modified the buildings frame to accommodate the new situation. They also designed a stainless steel tower with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to achieve the goal of ""The Mooring Mast"""	2	3		3																					
5591	6	"There was many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a lot of dirigibles outside the @LOCATION4 use hydrogen over helium. The problem was hydrogen is highly flammable, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densley populated area such as downtown New York City."" @CAPS1 can only imagine how tragic and chaotic that would have been. Another obstacle the builders faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting do to violent air currents. That would've meant that these dirigibles could just have got swept back. In conclusion there was several obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
5593	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to be cautious about safety, which played a big role with the dirigibles. Many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable they wouldn't want the city to be destroyed and at risk of a massive fire. Another problem was nature itself. There were violent air currents above the building and not be a danger to the local pedestrians of New York. The final obstacle builders faced when trying to pursue the dirigible idea was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. They would be breaking the law to even allow it within the area of the building, with so many issues occurring in the development of the dirigible plan, the idea of using them quietly disappeared.	3	3		3																					
5594	6	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was. how to build the morring mast. how to atach the mooring mast to the frame of the Empire @CAPS1 Building.	1	1		1																					
5595	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible's to dock there. The main obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles need a large area to land. Al Smith said to add a mooring mast to the top of the building and that would allowed a dirigible to land for several hours. During the time of land the dirigible may get ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" Passengers could get off and on the dirigible safely by walking down a gangplank to the open platform. Architects had trouble putting a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because they were afraid that the load of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted. Dirigibles had trouble with saftly, most of dirigibles use hydroge instead of helium, but hydrogen was highly flammable. The greatest obstacle of mooring mast was nature itself, wind were high due to violent air currents, and it would not be safe for dirigibles. The practical reason why dirigibles weren't allow to moor at @ORGANIZATION2 was law agaist airship flying too low. The idea of dirigible was given away to airplanes. The obstacles the builders of @ORGANIZATION3 faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was solved."	3	4		4																					
5600	6	"In order to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building, many changes had to made. The builders and planners both faced many obstacles. First of all, to even consider the idea, they had to ""consult with experts"" which meant taking tours and doing research. They had to find a ""safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" The next obstacle is in paragraph @NUM1. Docking a dirigible to the building would put ""stress"" on the building's frame. The builders had to ""modify and strengthen"" the frame. One of the last obstacles they had to face was designing the tower. The builders eventually decided on a rocket shaped mast with four wings at the corners to house the mooring arm. They had to house the machinery to winch the derigible, too. Overall, the builders had to make drastic changes, spend a lot of money, all for something that wasn't even safe in the end."	3	3		3																					
5602	6	"The builders faced a few problem on letting it dock there. One problem was that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" said on page @NUM1. The were all so lead weights to lower the dirigibles down but this could also set risk for people said on page @NUM1."	2	2		2																					
5604	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, their were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was the safety. Paragraph @NUM1 from the excerpts explains that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" It shows us that if an accident was to happen on the mast above a densely populated area like downtown New York, then the accident could get ugly. Another reason why was nature itself. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the, ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was another safety issue because the dirigibles would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A third obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. As you can see those were some obstacles builders faced."	3	3		3																					
5605	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. An obstacle dealt with if the dirigibles were fit to dock in the Empire State Building. Another obstacle dealt with the mast. These obstacles made this construction a failure such as the author who says, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed"" in @CAPS1 thirteen.First of, @CAPS1 five states the dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make some lighter in the air."" @CAPS1 six states that, ""Some were as long as one thousand feet."" @CAPS2 how may a blimp of that size ever managed to land on the Empire State Building. Also @CAPS1 nine says ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This @CAPS1 also states that ""The stress the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.""These were just a few of the obstacles the builders had to face. The fate of the mast such as in @CAPS1 @NUM1 says ""was neither practical nor safe."" The architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. In the end the mast was a great attempt, but indeed a failure."	1	2		2																					
5610	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mask"" by @PERSON1. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building were all very competitive for the Building to be very tall and they did not have a very great plan that they used. They wanted the building to have a great top and wanted it to also be useful, so they wanted dirigibles to dock there They figured out after that it wasn't such a good idea when they looked into the history of how many accidents happened. If any accident happened in New York like that then it would be a very big deal because there are so many people that live there. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mask. They felt it would be unsafe for many reasons. This is the reason why the builders went through many obstacles"	2	2		2																					
5611	6	Acording to the @CAPS1 both the @CAPS2 and the architects came across several obsticles when it came too building an Area Where Blimps could land that made this @CAPS3 unfesable. One of the @CAPS4 Reasons that this @CAPS3 @CAPS5 was due to the Air laws that made it illegal to fly too low in urban Areas. An additional conflict was fact was that @CAPS6 winds could push the tale of the blimp into sharp spires of neighboring buildings that would pop the dirigible as if it where a balloon.	2	2		2																					
5612	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast I have seen how the builders of the empire State building ran into obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The empire State building was already standing in the architects decided to renovate and make a dock for dirigibles. The architects working on this project had to strengthen the buildings frame. They also had to have wenches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. The architects also needed to install housed elevators and stairs bring passengers down to the base floor and back up. After the renovations were done to be empire state building it had 102 floors. After the building was done the owners found out that they could not let dirigibles on to the building. They would break the law of airships flying to low in urban areas. So the empire state building was finished but you could not use it for dirigible's.	3	2		3																					
5615	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was getting the mooring mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible mounted at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" The architects solve this problem by modifying the building's framework. Another problem was wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" @CAPS1 there was one wire connected to the front, the dirigible would go round and round due to the back being exposed to the winds. This problem was never fixed. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and while some were overcome, the rest weren't, resulting in the ultimate failure of the mooring mast."	3	2		3																					
5619	6	"Al Smith, four-term governor of New York and a leader of the Empire State Building's construction, had a vision. His vision was to create a two-hundred fifty foot mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building, not only making it the world's tallest building, but also to dock passengers and deliver goods through the use of dirigibles or blimps. Unfortunately, there were many @CAPS1 facing the builders of the Empire State Building regarding the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast. The main concerns the builders faced were the materials that dirigibles are made out of, mother nature, and airship laws. The first obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced concerning the docking of dirigibles on its mast was the materials dirigibles are made from. According to the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... highly flammable..."" The builders realized this posed as a huge safety threat, especially over a densely populated city. The second obstacle the builders faced regarding the docking of dirigibles on its mast was mother nature herself. The article states, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents... neither practical nor @NUM1). The construction workers realized that having passengers moving on and off the mast, could be very dangerous in harsh weather conditions. The final obstacle the construction workers faced was an overlooked airship law. The story says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" (@ORGANIZATION2). The workers realized that it was against the law to even tie up an airship to a building. In conclusion, the three main @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in regards to the allowance of docking dirigibles on its mast were the materials that dirigibles are made of, nature, and airship laws."	4	4		4																					
5625	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast, written by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their ideas. The builders thought they would be able to make a successful landing dock for dirigibles. Everything they did was all planned right but when it came time to test it, it didn't work. There were quit a few problems with there idea of using the Empire State Building is a landing dock for dirigibles.One reason that this one not successful was because the dirigibles wern't able to get close enough to attach the building In order for the dirigible to be ankered would be for a rope to be tied to some thing. But the balloons wern't able to get to close to the building because the point at the top of the building was making it too hard. If it got to close to the point, it could puncture the balloon which would not be could because the gas that holds it up would come out and the balloon would fall. There is one more major reason they're plan did not work.The other major reason would be because of the wind. the wind would get so wild the back of the blimp would sway back and forth, making it dangerous for passengers. They wouldn't be able to weigh it down with weights would be dangerous for the pedestrians down in the city @CAPS1 of the major reasons why the plan to dock dirigibles at the empire state building would not work.	3	3		3																					
5626	6	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. To start off, there was a lack of suitable landing area. This was a tough obstacle because the builders needed to think of a place that extremely large dirigibles could land while in a crowded place like New York City. Next, was figuring out a safe way of getting the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. This was another tough obstacle because if the mast was just placed on the top of the building, it would add stress to the building's Frame, which is dangerous. Lastly, and most importantly, was the problem of nature. At the top of the building there were constantly shifting wings due to violent air currents. This was an extremely dangerous obstacle because the winds could cause the dirigibles to be constantly moving and shaking. Also, if they were weighted down by lead weights to prevent them from being affected by the wind, the weights would be dangling above pedestrians on the street. To allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders @ORGANIZATION1 many different obstacles.	3	4		4																					
5627	6	"Based on the excerpt, builders faced many problems in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. First, safety would be a large problem. Back then, most dirigibles used hydrogen (which is highly flammable) instead of helium to power them. This means that if there was a malfunction such as a fire, not only with the dirigible burst into flames, but the Empire State Building could too. Another obstacle builders had to confront was mother nature. According to paragraph @NUM1 of the reading, the location of the Empire State building has ""violent air currents"" with shifting winds. This problem would cause the dirigible to not stay stable. Although solutions like lead weights being hung from the back of the dirigible were offered, this only lead to more problems. If the lead weight fell, where would it land? The answer would be in the streets of @ORGANIZATION2 where pedestrians could be harmed. The final obstacle builders would have had to get through if they continued their plans for the dirigibles would be a law. The law stated (according to the reading) that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So in theory, all of the plans the builders of this concoction had to be put to rest due to the governments law. In conclusion, many problems arose as building, and plans to make the ""Dirigible dock"" were made."	3	3		3																					
5631	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles, while trying to build a dock for dirigible. One problem was safety. While American dirigibles used helium, other countries filled their dirigibles with highly flamable helium. If a dirigible were to ignite in a heavily populated area like New York City, the result would be deadly. Nature also caused problems with the mooring mast. The winds above the building were too strong and ever-changing, and could potentially destroy the dirigibles. Finally, federal laws stated that an air craft could not dock that close to a building. These three factors made it impossible for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5633	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable, if it caught fire above a city, the results would be diasastrous. Another obstacle was that at such a hieght,  the winds would blow the back of the dirigible around. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law that airships could not fly below a certain hieght over cities. All of these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible	3	3		3																					
5634	6	"Back in the roaring @NUM1's and @NUM2's, New York City was a popular place which needed to adapt to the ways of modernizing travel. A new and fashionable form of travel was the blimp, or the dirigible. These @ORGANIZATION2 balloons had nowhere to dock in the @ORGANIZATION2, and solving that solution was harder than expected.Al Smith, architect of the Empire State Building decided that he could use the top of the tower as a mooring mast for these dirigibles. After adapting the entire building for the change, Smith ran into a few problems.The first @ORGANIZATION2 issue surfaced when a German dirigible exploded in New Jersey. This let Smith know that it would be a bad idea to allow any @CAPS1 blimps near as most non-American crafts were filled with ""hydrogen [which] is highly flammable,"" leaving possibility for catastrophe. Another snag was the ""winds on top of the building... shifting due to... air currents"" which would cause the dirigibles to freely and dangerously sway in the wind. With the wind, they could crash into towers and ""would be dangling above pedestrians."" @CAPS2 valves also came into play as there was a preexisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" which would make any dirigible activity with the Empire State Building downright illegal."	4	3		4																					
5635	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in building a mooring mast for airships to dock at the top building. The stress and preasure of a thousand foot dirigible docked at the top of the building was too great for the buildings original frame work to support, so they had to reinforce and strengthen the framework and base so the preasure would be transmitted to the buildings foundation. Another obstacle was most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen was much more flamible and the hydrogen dirigibles like the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in fire and they didn't want that to happen over New york's population. The final obstacle was the violent and shifting air currents over the building. Even if the front of the dirigible or ""mast"" was tied to the mooring mast the back would swivel around the mooring mast. The many unseen obstacles of the mooring mast made it in unpracticle docking point for dirigibles. In the 1930s after airplanes, and dirigibles had disappeared the ticketing & bagging rooms were turned into tourist and site seers areas."	3	3		3																					
5636	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building were in the process of building the docking station they ran into many @CAPS2. One of these @CAPS2 being the air currents at the top of the building. The dirigible would be unable to stay still and safely let off its passengers. Evidence to support this claim comes from the article itself when it says, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the law. This law prohibited airships from flying low in a populated area. Therefore an airship trying to dock at the Empire State Building would be breaking the law. This was explained in paragraph fifteen of the article when it said, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" @CAPS1, it became very dangerous to dock these dirigibles in a populated area or near a building because there was the threat of them bursting into flame. Such as the dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. The article explains that the builders realized this new threat, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been..."" @CAPS2 plagued the construction of the docks."	4	4		4																					
5640	6	"Through life many people plan to make or build an amazing object but have to acomplish amazing feats in order to do this. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, @ORGANIZATION1 plans on building the tallest building in the world, but in order to do this he has to defeat many obstacles that you and I may never even think of. On December 11, 1929 the Empire State building was announced the world's tallest building. In making this huge building there were many obstacles. One of the obstacles was allowing dirigibles to dock on the building. ""The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows that it may be unsafe to allow dirigibles to dock due to the winds. Another quote that shows an obstacle of having dirigibles docking at the empire state building is, ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". This quote shows that it might be illegal to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. In life we defeat great obstacles but sometimes we cannot defeat the obstacles we face."	2	2		2																					
5644	6	There were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One of the reasons was that the dirigible hanging by one cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. This stress would cause the buildings foundation to crack. This obstacle caused the architects to have to strengthen the foundation, this cost them over sixty thousand dollars in modifications. Another obstacle was they had to make another floor which would be used for passengers and would let elevators bring the passengers to the eighty-sixth floor, where their baggage and ticket area would be located. These observation areas were to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once this was done, they then had complete the roof before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Another obstacle was nature itself, the winds at the top of the building were always shifting and the dirigibles, that usually land in open fields, could be weighted down with lead weights, but could not be used at the Empire State Building, where they would be hanging over pedestrians on the streets. Another obstacle was that there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for dirigible to tie up or even approach the Empire State Building. All these many obstacles led to the ideas of dirigibles and mooring mast, for the dirigibles had dissapeared.	3	4		4																					
5648	6	"The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 is mainly about builders and architects attempting to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building in New York. At first, the main idea of the mooring mast was to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast to drop off and bring on passengers. The mooring mast was needed because ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (paragraph @NUM1). One reason why this plan did not work out was because it was not safe, because the hydrogen that dirigibles use is highly flamable (and this could cause a serious fire). Also, if it was a windy day, the dirigibles could get pushed around by the winds. To stop this, they have lead weights to weight them down, but they cannot use these with all of the people and other buildings around. Also, dirigibles could not fly too low over these kinds of areas. Although the plan did not work, it was better to have everyone be safe."	4	4		4																					
5652	6	Al Smith had an ambitious plan to put his Empire State Building on top of New York. He envisioned the skyscraper as a dirigible port and a future transport hub. Techical limitations eventually proved insurmountable though. First, dirigibles had to deal with docking in an urban area. Dirigibles normally dropped lead weights to secure there landings, but this would be impractical when people were on the streets below. Wind was also a major problem because it made the blimp difficult to stabilize in the air. The wind would be ever more problematic in the city as if a Dirigible hit a building it would puncture and fall into New York city. Neither of the Dirigibles that tried to moor could because of wind and other buildings. As stylish as landing in the middle of @LOCATION1 would have been, safety problem could not be fixed and there were too many people around to risk it.	3	2		3																					
5655	6	"Many obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building as stated in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. These obstacles included safety and availability. The idea of being able to dock a dirigible to a building in the middle of a densely populated city such as New York was extremely unsafe between the explosive tendencies of Hydrogen and the unmanageable winds. With the winds the dirigible would continuesly move around the mast creating an extremely unsafe environment for all. Availability would also be put into question, in paragraph fifteen @ORGANIZATION2 tells about the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles @CAPS1 to dock due to the unavailable route of save entirence. This unavailability made traveling to the mooring mast almost impossible. The obstacles in the mooring mast include availability and safety."	3	2		3																					
5658	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several challenges in building a dock for dirigibles They would not be able to simply place of mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. The thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable would make the frame very unsturdy. With the weight of the dirigible and the wind pressure it would have to get transmitted to eleven hundred feet, where the foundation is. The would need to make the frame stronger to with stand the stress which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. In the end the mooring mast never was made because of safety, unpredictable nature and of the law itself. It was unsafe due to the highly flammable dirigibles putting the high populated region in danger. The winds would shift to constantly and violently and be to very difficult to control the dirigible. Also, the law that airships flying too low over urban areas would have made it illegal. Ships would not be able to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Overall, there were too many obstacles that made it impossible for the engineers to build a mooring mast.	3	4		4																					
5661	6	"There Are @CAPS1 things that Are worry Some About dirigibles docking there. One of them was the fact that ""The dirigibles would sway in the wind As the passengers walked down A Gangplank"". This would be unsafe because As it sways, it could knock the passengers off the plank and cause them to fall."	2	0		1																					
5662	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were: The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable.	2	2		2																					
5663	6	the obstacles the builders of the empire state @CAPS1 face. was that their expanded use in @LOCATION1 was the lack of a suitable landing erea. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his empire state Building.A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passangers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast.	1	1		1																					
5666	6	Based on the excerpt the builders faced many obstacles trying to attempt dirigibes to be allowed to dock on the Empire State building. The builders faced obstacles like the lack of land area in New York as said in @CAPS1 6. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it says that a big problem they faced was they could just land right on the flat roof and some other problems they faced in this @CAPS1 was the cable at the top of the building added stress to the building eleven hundred feet below the building and some of this work cost over sixty Thousand dollars. Problems with safety is the lead wieght be dangling high above pedestrians on the street which was niether practical or safe. And another unsafe thing is in @CAPS1 @NUM2, they said that Hydrogen in these dirigibles was highly flammable which is very unsafe. In � @NUM3 it says that there was an existing law against flying airship above urban areas.	2	3		3																					
5667	6	"The Empire State Building was an incredible building without the idea of the attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. But with this idea of this mooring mast it braught up many obstacles like the safety of the public. L�sted states ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This statement proves that if the dirigible were catch fire like the accident in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then the citizens of New York's lives would be at stake. This safety hazard is one of the builder's problems.     These archatets faced many challenges with this mooring mast idea. Including the dangerous factor of nature. L�sted states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This is extremely dangerous because the dirigibles start to move around the building while docked causing hazardous menuvers and putting pedestrian's lives at risk. For this mooring idea, it is too dangerous for the public and the city of New York."	3	3		3																					
5669	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were one it was very windy so it was hard for the dirigibles to hook up to the gear. Anouther was the dirigibles very flamable so they were a danger to the city if the caught on fire. One other reason was it is illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area	2	3		3																					
5670	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was safety because outside the U.S dirigibles were using hydrogen instead of helium which is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. One more obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law said it was illegal for a ship to approach or even be tied up to a building.	3	2		3																					
5671	6	"In the excerpt from ""the mooring Mast""by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building. First, they risk having the dirigibles from places outside the U.S cause a fire. @ORGANIZATION1 states ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). This would become a big issue because they will run the risk of having other dirigibles pass our highly densed air and cause a fire inadvertently. By building a loading dock they are potentially harming the area of downtown New York. Second another obstacle that would get in the way of building the dock is nature. Builders say ""The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). Even if they attempt to tie down the dirigibles there is a chance that the back will move around. the idea that the winds would be too much to handle they brought up alternatives like lead weights, but it will become a hazard for pedestrians. Finally there was a law that prevented any airships to fly too low. The article reads ""This law would make it ilegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (@CAPS1. @NUM3). the law made it extremely hard for the builders. The overall idea was to make the airship to land on the building, and this obstacle made it a bigger problem. The idea of a dock vanished, it was too much of a risk to do it. Nevertheless the excerpt by @ORGANIZATION1, ""The Mooring Mast"", describes the challenges put upon builders to build a dock."	3	4		4																					
5672	6	The obstacles of getting the dirigibles to be able to dock at the empire state building was, they couldn't put the fuell on top of the building. Putting mooring mast on top of the roof would make it very unstable and putt a lot of Pressure on it. For this to happen they had to modify the structure of the roof, which ended up costing over @MONEY1. After succefully building that they had another obstacle. It was trying to figure out how the dirigibles wouldn't move around with so much wind currents. They never figured out how and the idea just disappeared.	1	2		2																					
5673	6	"From the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attenting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the designing as well as the cost of this project could encounter problems. Such as, ""add stress to the building's frame."" If the mass interfered with the frame of the building, then changing the material of the building could cost ""over sixty thousand dollars!"" In addition, safety was a major component when trying to construct the mooring mast. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen...and hydrogen is highly flammable."" New York is a very populated area, which means when building a mooring mast, safety must be considered into perspective. Lastly, their were restrictions on airships flying too close to cities. As it states in the excerpt, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Overall, when constructing the mooring mast, many builders were blind to the potential problems, making the project unsuccessful."	3	3		3																					
5674	6	One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Because of the violent air currents the winds were constantly shifting. The dirigible would constantly be moving around. They couldn't even weigh it down, because there would be people far below them, and they could fall. A second obstacle they faced were the laws against it. There were existing laws about airships flying too low over the city. It was illegal for the airships to even come into the city.           Those two obstacles stop them using the dock for dirigibles.	3	3		2																					
5675	6	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the strong wind currents, the fact that dirigibles were very flammable, and that they were very large and hard to keep still. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that the use of hydrogen rather than helium should have stopped the project. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it states that the biggest obstacle was nature itself. For the reasons above those are some of the obstacles builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock there."	2	2		2																					
5677	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (@NUM1) the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents causing the dirigible's back to swivel around the mooring mast. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2) @CAPS1 the Hindenburg which blew up, if a Blimp blew up over downtown New York, tons of lives would be lost, a huge risk to the mooring mast. ""Was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) This law would prevent dirigibles from docking at the mooring mast legally. All of those obstacles contributed to the mooring mast being used only for show and contributing to the world's tallest building."	3	3		3																					
5678	6	In the excerpt the @CAPS1 were faced with multiple issues on their theory. It took lots of time for people to begin realizing reality. For example, Airships had a law preventing them from getting to low to urban areas. Also they realized major would play a negative role. Wind would cause the @CAPS2 to swing around all Docked. They thought to way down the rear of the ship, but soon realized that is unsafe over many people below. They had heard of a @CAPS2 in New Jersey was Destroyed by fire, Due to its hydrogen, Also unsafe in New York with such a @ORGANIZATION1 population. Overall they began to realize saftey issues and how unpractical it was to do all of this.	3	3		3																					
5679	6	"The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building was unrealistic because there was a lack of identification of possible flaws in this plan. As a new form of transportation, dirigbles were not safe. This was proven true when the German dirigble, ""Hindenburg"", exploded in 1937. In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not adressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location. In the crowded streets of New York City, suspending flamable dirigibles above population is unsafe. This location is also an obstacle because of the equipment needed to land the dirigible: lead weights. The use of lead weights to way down the dirigibles is unimaginable with the possible dangerous situations it could create. The creators of this idea solely designed this system on top of the Empire State building to incorporate a futuristic form of transportation to make the building more unique. The Empire State building builders and encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their because the concept was far past the capabilities of their age."	2	2		2																					
5681	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.In designing the mast, the steel frame of the State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new siteation, @MONEY1' worth of modifications were made to the buildings framework, Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.The mooring mast failed. Most dirigibles from outside of the @ORGANIZATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. Weather, such as violent air currents, were the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mast.	3	3		3																					
5682	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced is that the architects made the Empire State Building more dirigibles. The architects put the thousand-foot dirigible at the top of the building that is held by the cable tether. The dirigible's have to go through the wind pressure which was about eleven hundred feet below. The frame of the Empire State Building have to be strong and it cost more than sixty thousand dollars of modification to made the building's framework. The architects changed the design and made something new. The architects have a difficult obstacles of building the Empire State Building is to make it dirigibles.	1	1		1																					
5687	6	Based on the excerpt to the dirigibles were not ever able to dock atop the Empire State building because @CAPS1 it was a question of safty. The passage reads that most dirigibles from outside the United States are fulled with hydrogen which is flamible. This caused the Hindenburg a German made vessel to burst into flames in New Jersey, and when this happened the owners of the empire state building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had happend in the densly populated New York City. Also this was a question of safty because the winds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible all around. Lastly there is a law prohibiting the flight of airships in low urban aeras so the ships could not fly in New York City	3	3		3																					
5691	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, it describes many ways the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. It was hard enough for the builders to build the Empire State Building but on top of that they must make a mooring mast at the top. Four term governor of New York Al Smith said it best, ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring out some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" Another obstacle builders faced was having a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, only held by a single cable tether, was simply not safe. With this being said, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened, costing over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications. No matter how the builders built the Empire State Building they still face nature as an obstacle. These are examples builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
5692	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there were many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. Some of these obstacles include, poor designing, nature, and lack of landing area.Due to the poor designing of Al Smith the Age of Dirigibles had a concern on where to land them. Nature itself was a big obstacle as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The wind made this hard for the dirigibles to land. The last obstacle was the lack of landing area for these enormous balloons. Once Al Smith saw the opportunity to land the dirigibles on the Empire State Building, he took it."	2	2		2																					
5693	6	"Allowing a dirigibles to dock upon the top of the Empire State Building, would leave architects faced with challenging sinerio's. Adding a thousand foot dirigible onto the top of the building would add stress to the frame. A single cable tether to the blimp would not help the stress. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (L�sted. @NUM1) The frame of the Building would have to be modified to accommodate this new situation. The greatest reason why it was never fully constructed was Because of safety. Most dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... The owners realized how much worse have it been taking place above a densely populated area."" (L�sted. @NUM2). This makes travel out side the @LOCATION1 with dirigibles more difficult. Nature itself was a great obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast. The back of the ship will swivel around and around the mast cause of winds. ""The winds on top of the building shifts due to violent air currents."" (L�sted, @NUM3). This wasn't practical nor safe. These obstacles leaves builders faced with unrealized challenges to over come."	4	3		4																					
5695	6	And the builders of the Empire State building faced numerous challenges in order to add the mast to the building. They needed to consult with experts and learn all they could about how dirigibles themselves worked. It took engineers in New York and government workers all the way in Washington to piece together a plan on how to make it work. Just adding the mast would never work. Keeping it tethered by one cable would add a ton of stress to the framework, so all of the steel frame needed to be strengthened. Making the mast appealing to look at to took resources. Ultimately though, all the plans fell through. Nature had been the biggest problem. When currents are violent up in the air around the mast, which would cause the blimp the swing around dangerously. Had a ship crashed, hundreds of people in the urban New York would be crushed. The project had to be scrapped, with the mast becoming a purely decorative addition.	3	3		3																					
5696	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the author, ""... was destined to never fulfill its purpose [Empire State building being a dock for dirigibles], for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" As the author points out, there were many problems with this idea. The reasons were: safety, strong winds, and laws prohibiting this to happen. The safety issue was that the dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. In fact the Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. If a dirigibles burst into flames while near the Empire State Building, it would be very harmful to the many people in the city around the building. Strong winds were another problem because the Empire State Building is so high, the winds at the mooring station would be violent and unpredicting. This would make it difficult to land at the mooring station and if it successfully did attach, the back end of the dirigibles would be blown around by the wind. The final problem was that there was a law forbidding aircraft to be a certain distance from a city. This law was trying to prevent aircraft from crashing into city. With all of these problems, it is clear that this plan could never have worked effectively."	3	4		4																					
5697	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that putting the mast on the empire state building then having a giant dirigible moor on to it would cause stress on the building and could pull the mast right off causing it to weigh the dirigible down to the people and buildings it could cause death and destruction. Another obstacle was timing the construction right. They dont want the mast to be done when the whole building is only on floor @NUM1 out of 102.	1	2		2																					
5698	6	Not everyone can invent new ways of transportation for the future. Al Smith learned that the hard way when he hired a team of builders to install landing docks for dirigibles on the Empire State Building. The team ran into numerous obstacles that caused problems and derailed there progress. One problem that arised was that the weight of the dirigible would add stress to the buildings frame, which was only reenforced by steel. Another issue was safety. Dirigibles from outside the United States ran on hydrogen instead of helium, which is highly flammable. The most important problem was nature. Wind made maneuvering difficult, and violent current could be potentially fatal to passengers and pedestrians. They also cannot fly too close to the ground in urban, populated areas. Although the idea of the Empire State Building being used as an airdock was innovative, it was not practical or well thought out.	4	3		4																					
5699	6	"One obstacle that the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was, ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" New York City is full of buildings and there is not a lot a flat ground to land a dirigible. The builders second obstacle was that they couldn't find a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. The builders would need to make a stronger building frame so the mast could safely be on the top of the building without adding stress to the frame. Another obstacle that the builders faced was nature. The wind at the top of the building was very unpredictable and strong at times. The back of the dirigible would move from the wind, even if it was tied to the building. The last reason was that there was a law that wouldn't allow the dirigibles to fly that low over an urban area. Therefore, the dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building."	3	4		4																					
5701	6	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the building of the Empire State Building had many obstacles the builders had to overcome. Some practical obstacles in building this landmark was the law against airships flying low, the complete dirigible mooring equipment wasn't installed, and greatest obstacle of all was nature surrounding the Empire State Building.The first obstacle builders had to overcome is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The problem with flying too low is the dirigibles couldn't even try to attempt to reach the building. In December 1930, one dirigable approached the mast, but couldn't get close enough fearing the forceful winds would cause it to run into the sharp spires. As if that wasn't a problem, the dirigible mooring equipment wasn't even installed which meant the newspapers being delivered would have to be caught by dangling ropes from the dirigable, which could get tiring. The greatest obstacle of all was nature. Winds at the top of the building were really strong due to the violent wind currents, which could cause the dirigable to keep moving, even when tied up to the mast.Overall, the nature of weather was the huge obstacle.	3	3		3																					
5702	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when they were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the safety of the people. The author states, ""Most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" This would have been a major problem. Another obstacle was the violent air currents that made it hard to land. In this essay it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This quote shows why landing would be dangerous. Finally, it was illegal to fly airships too low over urban areas. The text explains, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building, or even approach the area."" this shows how even if everything worked, they wouldn't be able to do it These are just three of the obstacles that prevented the builders of the Empire State Building from docking dirigibles."	4	3		4																					
5707	6	Based on The Mooring Mast article, by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building face numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their dream put New York on the forefront of modern travel never was fulfilled.     First, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework because of the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure, which would add stress to the frame. However, one of the greatest obstacles the builders encountered was safety. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, which is highly flammable and could be very dangerous, especially in highly populated areas such as New York. Also, the violent winds on top of the building made it impossible to keep the dirigibles stable and not swiveling around the mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down dirigibles that moored in the field, but this would be unsafe dangling from a building. Finally the idea violated a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. All of the contributing obstacles the builders faced made their dream of using the mooring mast for dirigibles unsuccessful.	4	4		4																					
5708	6	Some of the troubles builders came into play with while constructing the empire state buildings mooring mast, were structure, how it would be built, and how it could physically hold a blimp without being ripped out. One problem was figuring out how to reinforce the mast so that the lead could transfer to the foundation instead of ripping off the top half of the building.	1	1		1																					
5711	6	"The architects of the mooring mast faced many problems when building the mast itself. One of the problems was that most dirigibles outside of the country use hydrogen, which was highly flammable, rather than helium to make the blimps buoyant. If one of those blimps ever caught fire like the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, in New Jersey, then it would put many citizens in jeopardy. This densely populated area would be much more hazardous than a rural area in New Jersey.The last problem they faced was the law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 no foreign dirigible could dock and refuel there because of the type of gas keeping it afloat, while no @CAPS2 dirigible could dock and refuel because of the law prohibiting it, the idea of a mooring mast quickly diminished from the citizens imaginations and they looked to modern transportation such as airplanes."	3	3		3																					
5714	6	In the Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on it. To dock, a moor mast was necessary. One could not simply Place one on the empire state building because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would add stress, which would force more modifications to the frame costing upwards of sixty thousand dollars. The mooring mast was not completed mainly because of safety. After the combustion of the Hindenburg, owners of the Empire State Building realized a disaster it would cause if it hapened in New York. Nature was also an obstacle, with constantly changing violent air currents threatening to move the dirigible, which could not be anchored down as it could be in a field. It was a risk not worth taking. Lastly, a law passed earlier prevented dirigibles from even approaching buildings on such elevation over urban areas. These were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	4		4																					
5717	6	When the builders of the @ORGANIZATION2 took on the difficult task of building a mooring mast at the top of the structure for dirigibles to dock at, they faced various obstacles that made it difficult for them to carry out their plan. One of the first obstacles they were faced with was the fact that they couldn't just slap a long mooring mast on the building's flat roof. The huge dirigible that would be held by one cable tether would add an immense amount of stress to the building's frame and fandation. The builders responded by constructing an even stronger frame for the building. The main problem the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the structure were the safety issues. Dirigibles (aside from the @LOCATION1) mostly used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is extremely flammable and increases the risk of fire. Since the blimps would be above thousands of pedestrians of the city, the risk of a blimp catching fire was much too high. On top of that, the winds at the top of the Empire State Building were always Shifting due to the violent air currents, causing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. Although Al Smith had a great vision for docking blimps at the top of his building, the reality was that it was unrealistic, and the bulders were faced with too many obstacles for it to work.	3	3		3																					
5718	6	"While builders attempted to create a landing area for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they ran into many problems. Al @CAPS1 idea sounded unrealistic but with enough motivation they were set on trying to make it happen. After so much renovation, work, and ideas they had finally realized all the potential problems.What's being built all the problems became apparent. The main reason they never used the dock is because they realized it could possibly catch fire, like it had in New Jersey... ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". Also they warned about the intense winds on top of the tower. They feared it would continuously blow around the dirigible without a way to weigh it down. Another reason is it is against the law to fly airships to low over urban areas. The builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
5719	6	The obstacles the builders faced were very dangerous and unsafe. They were the difference between them failing or succeeding. One of the problems was violent air currents. The passage said that winds towards the top of the building were always shifting and they easily could have been able to swivel the dirigible. If this happened then they never would have been able to land.The next obstacle they faced was hovering over pedestrians. It just wasn't an option after the safety of the pedestrians was in danger. I was also a law that airships weren't allowed to fly that low over urban areas. So it made it illegal for them to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. It was just too dangerous to attempt.	3	3		3																					
5722	6	Most dirigibles from outside of U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1, New jersey, On May 6, 1937, the ownes of the Empire state Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken above a densely populated area such as downtown New york.	2	1		2																					
5726	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstecles in attemping to allow dirigibles to dock there. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing area. to solve this problem, Al Smith built a mooring mast. This would allow dirigibles to anchor their for several hours to refuel.	1	1		1																					
5729	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. By building a mooring mast, they had to make changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton. ""The steel frame of the building had been modified and strengthened"" in order for the mast to fit properly and remain stable and safe.        Another obstacle faced by the builders was creating a design that would allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. They were to tie the front of the aircraft to the building, however this didn't work out, because, as the author states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" All in all, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to let dirigibles dock there."	3	2		3																					
5731	6	Al Smith faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles dock on the mast on top of the Empire State building. The first problem him and the architects faced was they couldnt just put the mast on top of the building's flat roof. The mast would add stress to the buildings frame. Also, the dirigibles load and the wind would add stress. Another reason was safety. Most dirigibles used Hydrogen which was highly flammable. Also, the winds at the top of the building had violent currents. The winds were always shifting which would cause the back of the ship to move. Lastely, the dirigibles couldnt fly near the building because there was a law against air crafts flying to low over urban areas which made it illegal for dirigibles to tie to the mast anyways.	3	3		3																					
5734	6	"When building the Empire State Building, the builders had to overcome many obsticles. One obsticle, for example, was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were very large, some spanding @NUM1 feet, therefore in a city of buildings, there were not many suitable areas to land. Another obsticle they had overcome was the fact that the city did not allow the dirigibles to be that close to rural areas. Although these reasons are plenty enough, the article mentions that perhaps the greatest obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (pg. @NUM2-paragraph @NUM3). All in all, the idea to land dirigibles in this place was too unrealistic."	2	3		3																					
5736	6	The problems that the Building had to face the could not unsolve the problem of mooring air ships to fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the installation of the landing gear.	0	0		0																					
5737	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire state building faced attempting to make the dock for dirigibles.The architects desgned a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. They would have to make the Empire State Building strong enough to have the wind blowing around up on top. In the late run they would have to face the law. These are the obstacles that the builders had to face.	2	2		2																					
5738	6	"Obstacles that the builders of the Empire state building were, They had planned for dirigibles to tie to the mast could not because the way of the height of the building was @CAPS1 high dirigibles would not be able to keep @CAPS2 while unloading. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""the goodyear blim columbia, attempted a publicity stunt Where it would it tie up and deliever a bundle of newspapers"", ""Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had Never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of newspapers on a rope dangling from the blimp"". other obstacles were, that dirigibles outside the united states had hydrogen in them Instead of helium, and hydrogen was very flammable."	2	2		2																					
5739	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were two practical obstacles. Nature itself. Even if the dirigible was tethered up to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Another thing was that it was illegal for airships to fly over too low over urban areas. Although two dirigibles attempted but failed, by the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared.	2	2		2																					
5740	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the stress on the building's frame, the building required over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to fix this. Also the back end of the dirigible would swing freely in the strong wind, this is usualy fixed by attaching a lead weight to the back in the fields where they usualy land but dangling that over a city is a very dangerous. Anothe problem is the law stating no aircraft flying to low over urban areas. Finaly dirigibles never caught on. So the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles In their attemt to make a dirigible docking station.	3	3		3																					
5745	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main problem was that, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This could be a serious problem if the dirigible burst into flames and fire rained down on, ""a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle to the creation of the mooring mast was the wind, which, ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles would have to be, ""weighted down with lead weights... where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street."" This would be, ""neither practical nor safe."" because the weights could fall and kill people. The final obstacle for building a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The builders of the mooring mast faced many problems, ""that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."""	4	3		4																					
5749	6	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building the workers faced many obstacles. One of the obstacles was safety. While the dirigible, or zeppelin, was docked its body would sway in the breeze. This lead to a question of safety for the passengers getting on and off. Also there was no safe way to weigh the dirigible down, like when the dirigible lands in a field. Any weights used would be hanging over pedestrians.  Another obstacle was the law prohibiting airships flying low over urban areas This law made it illegal for dirigibles to dock or approach the area The main obstacle was nature itself. There are very violent winds at the top of the Empire State Building which would cause the dirigible to sway. Docking at the Empire State Building was too complicated for the idea to be completed.	3	3		3																					
5750	6	"In some cases builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as safety. As stated in the reading. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: dirigibles outside @LOCATION1 used hydrogen, which is highly flammable."" If a dirigible was to catch fire on top of that building it could do a lot of damage. The next reason is there are ""laws against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The Empire State building was built in the middle of downtown, if something was to go wrong the dirigibles could harm a lot of people. Another reason is because of nature. The author stated, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This put the dirigibles at risk of hitting that building or another. The last reason is because ""the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed."" If the law and safety hadn't been a problem there would be no way to land a dirigible because they didn't have the things needed to land it. The obstacles made happened because they failed to fully look over their plan."	4	4		4																					
5751	6	The obsticles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there where the weather, and the Building Frame. The @CAPS1 obsticle was the wind because the winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violant air currents. The wind was an obsticle because of a big gust of wind came it could not building materials or even workers off the building. A second obsticle was the building Frame because the dirigible was so big that at the top of the building being held by a single cable, that would add stress to the frame and would make the building unsteady. These are two examples of the obstacles the builders working on the empire state building @ORGANIZATION1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	2	2		2																					
5753	6	"The Mooring Mast, by @ORGANIZATION2 describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Empire State Building was competing with the Chrysler Building in being the tallest building. Al Smith, the governor at that time, didn't want to be beat. Being the governor of New York, Smith added more floors to the building developing it into a dirigible dock.As time went on, the building ran into more problems. Tying a thousand-foot dirigable to the building, would add stress to the frame. ""The steal frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to be accomadate this new situation"" The frame around the building wasn't durable enough to hold a ""blimp"" The building would collapse while taking other buildings down. sixty-thousand dollars went into re-fining the frame but in the end, the building still failedAfter the frame was stable enough, more problems ocured. ""The greatest reason was one of safety Dirigibles used hydrogen, meaning it flammable."" Not only did the reason of safety of people went aganist the Building so did the law ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" once Al Smith realized even the law forbidded this, all plans that rose into action stoped, and the Empire State Building remained the same."	3	3		3																					
5754	6	"When the Empire State Building was created it was supposed to be a ""pit stop"" for dirigibles, known today as blimps. It was meant to be the modern way of travel, but many problems surfaced changing the plans. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a major safety hazard! Another problem presented itself ""[A] law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" If anything were to go wrong with the ship many people would be put in danger. The harsh wind nature would provide the risk of puncturing the blimp against buildings; also endangering the people below it."	3	3		3																					
5755	6	"The obstacles builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire were saefty, nature, and U.S law. Saefty was a major obstacle because, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United states used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1 lin @NUM2). Nature itself was another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the empire state building. ""The Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3 line @NUM4).

5757	6	"The builders of the Empire States Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Paragraph fourteen said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 planning for the mast, builders did not account for the high winds.

The greatest reason the mooring mast of the Empire State Building never fulfilled its purpose was because of safety issues. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" On May 6, 1937, the German Zeppelin, Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Owners of the Empire State Building than recognized that if the same incident was to take place in New York, more lives would be lost. Builders of the Empire State Building failed to recognize the dangers of the mooring mast."	4	3		4																					
5762	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow the dirigibles to land there. The most prominent obstacle was that posed by nature, which was that there was always a constant change in wind direction, so the dirigibles would not be able to land safely. The architects thought that heavy weights could be put onto the ends of the blimps, but they then realized that that would not be safe for pedestrians walking below Also, the building had to be a ceetain number of feet high, in order for the airship height rule to be eliminated. If it was not an something exploded, the heavily populated city of New York would be in grave danger. In theory, the mast for dirigibles was a revolutionary idea, but in reality it just wouldn't work.	2	3		3																					
5763	6	"There were many obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles were that architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. This is because as it says on paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" Another obstacles were making the mooring mast of the Empire State Building to fulfill its purpose. It was very hard to make the mooring mast fulfill its purpose because the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These are the reasons why the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building."	2	3		3																					
5765	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building obstacles can be described in the following ways. First of all, the main obstacle was the nature of the mast. They described it as, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM1). Secondly, the dirigibles would dangle on top of the building, which wasn't safe for pedestrians. Lastly, there was a law for airships that couldn't fly too low or too high. The above explains the obstacles of the Empire State Building for dirigibles."	2	2		2																					
5768	6	"Throughout the designing and construction stages of the Empire State building's mooring mast, builders and engineers confronted many issues including, the distribution of building stress, fire hazards and the constant shifting caused by winds. During the planning stages of engineers, they confronted an issue, how to alliviate stress on the Empire State Building's frame. According to engineers making the ""thousand foot dirigible moored at at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame..."" @CAPS1, the building would require ""over sixty thousand dollars"" in redesigning and modifying the current building's foundation and framework. Secondly, engineers and builders never considered the fire hazards, which they were confronted with after the completion of the mooring mast. The American dirigibles were filled with hydrogen rather than helium, making that gaseous-filled transportation highly flammable."" An example of this safety violation occurred with the burning of a dirigible in Lakehurst, New Jersey, causing builders to reflect on the possible severity of this possible accident in the heavily populated area of New York. Thirdly, New York had ""violent air currents"" which could cause the rear of the dirigibles to swivel and shift. The only possible solution was to way down the back with lead blocks, but this would be ""neither practical nor safe."" Engineers and builders of the Empire State Building were confronted with many problems and concerns sometimes only addressed by irrational solutions."	4	4		4																					
5769	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was that if a dirigible was moored by a single tether, ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" Another obstacle was that most foreign dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable, and when the Hindenburg was destroyed, builders realized that accident would have been much worse if it had happened ove a densely populated area like New York City. A third obstacle was violent wind currents that would cause the back of the ship to swivel around, and the back of the dirigible couldn't be weighted down like in open landing fields because that would cause the weights to dangle dangerously above that pedestrians on the street. These were major obstacles, and they are the reasons that the mast on top of the Empire State Building was never used dock blimps."	4	4		4																					
5771	6	"Constructing anything is always a difficult taksk, but trying to construct the worlds tallest building and have dirigibles being able to dock there is even harder. The workers who were modifing the Empire State Building had nemerous obstacles that stood in their way when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. The obstacle they could not controll was nature herself. The winds were said to be ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" according to the excerpt wich made it difficult for dirigibles to dock there, and dangerous. Also another factor that was an obsticle for the constructors was the building itself. The structure of the building would have to be modified because the dirigible ""would add stress to the building's frame,"" so constructors wolud have to make the building support this tremendous stress. Another obsticle was safty because some dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was extremely flamable and dangerous for the massive population on the ground. These are a few of the many obstacles faced when modifing the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
5774	6	On @DATE1, The Empire State Building was announced to reach the height of 1,250 feet. Al Smith, the architect of the building mentioned that the top would be more than ornamental. It was said that this amazing dream would come true for aviation pioneers. The building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships called dirigibles, otherwise known as blimps. This was thought out to be a great idea. Things didn't quite turn out as originally planned, and Fate struck. As fate struck, things should have been more apparent before it  was ever constructed. Resons being; Most blimbs from outside the states run on hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is more flammable. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, causing the dirigible to swivel, and it would be a disaster for anything to happen to New York City and the pedestrians it holds. Another law was the law of how close airships can be to the building. Thus, still leaving the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, but never completing the original goal.	3	3		3																					
5776	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles are enormous steel-framed ballons they can travel for long periods at time of seventy miles per hour. Thoogh dirigibles seemed great for attracting people by ways of travelin modernation, the builders faced a complex obstacle. There was no area of suitable landing for dirigibles. In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there many thoughout changes in the building needed to be considered. The load being transported off the dirigible would add stress to the building frame, as would the wind pressure. To suit the buildings with accommodating the dirigible, the price for modifications to the building would cost @MONEY1. Many obstacles were scientifically proven why the dirigible could not dock at the Empire State Building. The issue of safety involving the hydrogen gasses being highly flammable were to much of a risk in the high populated are of New York. Also nature was a large obstacle that was faced due to the wind at such a tall altitude. The law implying that airships couldn't fly too low was a practical reason why the dirigibles could not dock at the building. ""One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."" A quote by Al Smith. The obstacles involving the moderate transportation idea were too impractical in using the mooring mast for dirigibles on the empire state Building"	3	3		3																					
5779	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. The architects could not just drop a mooring mast on the top. If they did, the whole building's foundation would have to be changed. Nature was also a major reason to stop the project. The wind currant were always changing and the blimp would swirl around. Safety was the greatest reason to shut down the job. Hydrogen is very flammable and if the blimp, which would be over New York was to burst into flames many people would be killed. In conclusion, these obstacles are why the builder stopped and didn't complete the project for the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5780	6	The Empire State Building faced numerous problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The most important reason was the safety of the people. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to power their dirigibles and hydrogen is extremely flammable The death toll would be astronaumical over a dense population as downtown New York. Another obstacle faced in this creation was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and the idea of a dirigible dangling high above pedestrians was not safe. The last reason that the dirigibles were not safe was the existing law in the U.S. At the time of the building of the Empire State Building, a law existed that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. Therefore, the dirigible was to close to the ground and was not allowed to dock. The idea of dirigibles docking at the Empire State Building is a phenomenal idea, however, there are to many obstacles prohibiting it.	3	3		3																					
5782	6	There are many problems with trying to dock dirigibles to the Empire State Building. First, there was a German dirigible called the Hindenburg that caught fire due to the hydrogen. Having a dirigible go up in flames over dense New York would result in many lives lost. Second, the wind 1,250 feet in the air is very strong and unpredictable. There was no way to be sure that the dirigibles could even dock or be controlled once docked. Lastly, there is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. It would almost certainly be against the law for a dirigible to be so close to a building with so many people in it. Since these problems all could result in deaths, the idea was thrown out.	3	3		3																					
5783	6	"The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In the beginning preparation., The builders thought it would be a great idea to let dirigibles (also known as blimps) to dock there. They didn't take into account the obstacles and struggles that they would soon face. The builder's didn't take into account the wind pressure and what the stress of the blimp's load would do to the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's Foundation, which was nearly eleven hundered feet below."" This was a huge problem the architects and over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework. ""Safety was also another big issue."" Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If a fire had broken out over a highly populated area such as downtown New York, the results could have been disastrous. The winds also were problem. Even if the blimp was tied down to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swing around and could result in a dangerous accident. There was also laws against low flying ships. The architects For the Empire State Building should have thought it through."	4	4		4																					
5785	6	The empire State building builders faced a couple of Problems of docking dirigibles to the mooring mast. Some, I don't even know, @CAPS5 I'll just buildup from here & @CAPS1 what @NUM1. The dirigible. Now I never learned about the @CAPS2 of a zeppelin, but I do know one thing. Do @CAPS7 get out from the front, or sides? I @NUM2. The mast itself. This thing was a failure from the @CAPS3. (don't question why I chose Something else for one of the multi-@CAPS4 questions). The reason why is that @CAPS5 many things could go wrong. This thing can @ORGANIZATION1, & @CAPS6 fall off unless @CAPS7 do something really special for forging a building this high.Overall, it's been a long while, anyways these problems, & Several others that I forgot to mention for obvious reasons are @CAPS6 the reason why we don't use  zeppelins as much anymore...	1	0		1																					
5786	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 describes how safety, laws, and nature are the three main obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the greatest reason that dirigibles could not be docked in @ORGANIZATION2. The biggest safety hazard was that many countries outside of the @LOCATION2 use hydrogen in their dirigibles instead of helium. A German dirigible had recently been destroyed in a fire in New Jersey because, ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State building realized that the accident would have been far worse if it had occurred, ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) and by docking dirigibles there, they run the risk that it could happen. Nature was another big obstacle that hindered the success of a mooring mast. Violent air currents at the top of the Empire State Building were always causing winds to change, so because only the front of the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, ""the back of the ship would swivel around"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). They could not use lead weights to weigh down the back like they used in open fields because having weights hanging above pedestrians on the street, ""was neither practical nor safe"" (@CAPS1, @NUM1). Nature was a major obstacle because it could not be changed and there was no easy way to fix the issues it caused. The last obstacle was an existing law which prevented airships from, ""flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1, @NUM5). This law made it illegal for the ship to both approach the area and tie up to the building, which was a huge obstacle that was impossible to get around. The obstacles of safety, laws, and nature that the builders of the Empire State Building faced made it impossible to dock dirigibles to the moore mast on the building."	4	4		4																					
5787	6	The building had a steel framed body up to @NUM1 floors the glass windows to the 102nd floor. They had to also had to upgrade the building because the stress that gets put on from the blimps.	1	1		1																					
5790	6	The excerpt of The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted reveals that the architects of the Empire State faced a number of obstacles. Not only was the construction of the building now competive, but its expectations were unrealistic. The idea for such a masterpiece of a building held a number of potential problems that its architects not very competitive. As the work-in-progress of the Chrysler building grew, the Empire State Building strived to be taller. In order to achieve greater heights, its architects suggested and addition of a mooring mast, to not only make the building the tallest, but to add to its purpose. The addition of a mooring mast would require a lot of planning, though. If a giant steel framed balloon were to dock at the top of the building as is, it could dangerously shake the foundation of the building, so the frame of the building had to be rebuilt much stronger. Also, the architects didn't realized the danger of docking dirigibles. Dirigibles, or blimps, were fueled by hydrogen, which is very flammable, and proved a threat to the thousands of people living below.	2	2		2																					
5791	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obsticles attempting to allow dirigibles also known as blimps to dock there. some of these obstacles faced by the builders were that the architecs could not drop a mooring mast on the flat roof of the Empire State Building. Attaching a thousand-foot dirigible to the top of the building's frame ""would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1 in paragraph @NUM1. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly @NUM2 feet below"". Also it was very unsafe allowing the highly flamable dirigible to coast over a highly populated area. Lastly the article states ""the greatest obsticle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The ship would ""swivel"" around the mooring mast. Dirigibles should be landing in open fields, where they could not dangle above pedestrians."	3	3		3																					
5792	6	There were plenty of obstacles the builder faced it trying to allow the dirigibles to dock here are some. First having something this big land on a @NUM1 foot building would add lots of stress to the buildings frame. All of this stress have to be distributed throughout the eleven hundred foot building which was unthoughtof. In order to make the building suitable for all this weight it would cost over sixty thousand dollars and that was alot concidering every thing elsethat they were doing. Those were @CAPS1 a few obstacles they had trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building.	2	2		2																					
5793	6	"The builders of the Empire State building ran into some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  Because of all the modifications they would need to make in order to have a mooring mast would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  It was such an expensive modification because they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the"" flat roof on the Empire State Building.  The stress a thousand-foot dirigible would put on the building's frame would be too much, this was their obstacle.  The builders needed to strengthen and modify the steel frame of the Empire State Building in order to hold the dirigibles as desired."	1	2		2																					
5794	6	The builders of the empire state building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. Mainly the idea was just not practicle. Having an up to @NUM1 foot blimp is full of flamable nitrogen hovering over a densely populated area was an extreme danger. One accident and tons of lives would be at stake. Especially after the German blimp the Hindenburg crashed, workers knew, had that happened in New York their death tolls would be huge.Along with the extreme perels that the builders knew would be at stake, mother nature would also not make it easy for dirigible to dock at the empire state building. The winds atop the building were constantly shifting. The air currents were too violent and posed to many threats for danger. Even when the ship was anchored, the back of the ship would swivel as if attached to a hinge. Lead tools can be used to weigh down the blimp, but hanging above tons of people this would not be a safe idea.Overall the idea of having a dirigible connected to the empire state building is just not safe and not worth what could be lost.	3	3		3																					
5795	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there @CAPS1 was the actual design of the mooring and modifications that would have to be made to the building. Due to the stress of the wind pressure and the load of the dirigible, structure of the building had to be made stronger. The mast would also have to withstand holding down the dirigible just one cable tether, which would put a lot of stress on the mast and building. Another issue faced by the builders was the fact that dirigibles from outside the United States most the used hydrogen, not helium, in the balloon, which made it more flammable and dangerous. If one ever caught on fire above New York City, it would be disastrous. Finally, there was already a law in place that airships could not fly to low over urban areas. This law made it so that it was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to, or even approach the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges, most too great to overcome. When it came to trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the spire of the building.	4	3		4																					
5799	6	"Basically this excerpt is talking about the ""The Mooring Mast"". It is all about the construction. One of the obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced to is the safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote reveals that the dirigibles they made is highly flammable and it's dangerous for people's lifes.  Pretend that the dirigible is on fire while it's flying up high to sky, it causes lifes.     The other obstacle the builders faced to is that it against the law. ""The other reason practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Even though the building is the tallest building in New York. But it is still too low for the laws. Airship can not fly that low over the urban area, it causes accidents.         The Empire State Building is over 1,250 feet, which means on the top of the build has strong and forceful winds and the like dirigibles couldn't stop and get close to the top of the building. ""In December 1930, the U.S Navy dirigible @CAPS1 Angeles approached the mooring mast could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful wind."""	4	3		4																					
5801	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Wind caused a great problem in the docking of the dirigibles ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" (para 6). The swinging of the dirigibles body would cause pulling on the building that the building's current frame wouldn't be able to support. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" (para @NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building now had to strengthen and modify the building's frame to suit the stress of the dirigibles' loads Another obstacle that the builders of the building faced was the framing of the mast. The roof had to be completed before the mast's framing could take place. The workers had to work for another two monts after the building was already complete due to Al Smith's idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The builders worked hard to suit the new building for the docking of dirigibles. Unfortunately their work was for nothing."	3	3		3																					
5803	6	"There were some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the violent wind currents that made the dirigibles rear swivel, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" A second obstacle was a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, which made the mast nearly useless. A third obstacle was that foreign dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable. After the dirigible called ""The Hindenburg"" was destroyed, ""the owners realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Those are the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3		4																					
5804	6	Based on the excerpt The mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were fire, wind, and the laws against airships flying to low over urban areas.If they let the dirigibles dock there they would risk the dirigibles @CAPS2 on fire because dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. and the Hydrogen is highly flammable. Another Obstacle would be the Wind, the winds were Shifting because of violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around, and if they put weights on the back it would not be safe for pedestrians on the street. And the last obstacle would be the law against airships flying to low over urban area, I would make it illegal for a Ship to tie to the building. Those were the @CAPS1 they faced.	4	3		4																					
5805	6	"The expectation for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was very high. The men who built the massive structure should've realized that these expectations were urealistic. Al Smith had planned for dirigibles to refuel and to drop off/pick up passengers while docked at the @ORGANIZATION1. These plans would never manifest because; for in dirigibles were powered by hydrogen and it is highly flammable which could result in disaster, the winds atop the Empire State Building were much too strong, and there was a law permitting aircraft's from flying so low over urban areas.In one incident in Lakehurst, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. The owners of the @ORGANIZATION1 saw ""How much worse that accident could have been [in New York City]. ""The greatest obstacle to use of the mooring mass was nature itself"" because the wind was so strong. Dirigibles couldn't even get close enough to dock. The law on the altitude of airships wouldn't allow dirigibles to even get close to the @ORGANIZATION1. The plans for the Empire State Building were never realistic and could never be fullfilled."	3	3		3																					
5807	6	Elders of the Empire State Building faced many complications Safety was a major concern.  Battling with the harsh winds would also be a problem.When the idea of the mast was created, not many realized the reality of the concept.  To put an extremely heavy object and attach it to just a tether, was not safe enough.  The combination of combustible gases also suggested pulling down town New York at risk.To land on such a small roof would be difficult due to strong winds.  Guiding the dirigible to such a delicate landing would prove to be hazardous with the strong winds.The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obsticles when constructing the mooring mast.	3	3		3																					
5809	6	"The main problem in the original design of the mooring mast was that ""the architects could'nt just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load & the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" Another obstacle the builders faced with the construction of the mast could be another example of the German dirigible ""Hindenburg"". With some dirigibles using the highly flammable hydrogen instead of helium another ""Hindenburg accident"" could prove to be fatal in a ""highly populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 perhaps the greatest obstacle would be ""nature itself."" The high force winds on top of the empire state building would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Although the dirigibles could be weighted down, the weights would be hanging over pedestrians, which ""was neither practical nor safe."""	4	3		4																					
5811	6	the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reason that should have been apparent before it was even constructed. the greats reason was one of the safety: most dirigible from out sit the united @CAPS1 used hydrogen rather then helium, and and hydrogen is highly flammable.	1	1		1																					
5812	6	"In the 1930's, the idea to have a mooring mast mounted on the top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles to dock was a very popular theory. However, there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced, such as existing laws concerning airships, flammable, hydrogen dirigibles, strong winds, and the stress a moored dirigible would add to the buildings frame. Existing ""air traffic laws would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the Empire State Building or even fly near it, since airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas (paragraph @NUM1). The destruction of the Hindenburg, a hydrogen dirigible, helped the owners of the Empire State building realize how dangerous dirigibles could be, especially if they combusted over downtown New York City (paragraph @NUM2). Strong winds also would be hazardous to dirigibles moored to the empire state building, seeing as the aircrafts couldn't be way down in the air (paragraph @NUM3). The steel frame of the building would also have to be modified to accommodate the stress added by a moored dirigible. All in all, it was very unrealistic to more dirigibles to the Empire State Building, as it would be unsafe."	3	3		3																					
5816	6	There were many obstacles that the Empire State buildings owner faced. One obstacle was not having enough room for the dirigible to land. To help solve this problem, the architect added mooring mast to increase the buildings height. Another obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be expanded in order for there to be more height added to the building. Altogether this would cost over @MONEY1. The main reason, and obstacle was safety. The owner had to make sure that the dirigible was not flammable, in which it was. Wind and nature also played a big part in deciding to go through with the idea. The strong winds would make the dirigible swing and constantly shift. This would make the dirigible hang over people on the streets of New York, which was not safe. The idea that landing dirigibles on top of the empire state building was neither safe or practical, and there were just too many struggles and obstacles for a plan like this to ever follow through.	3	3		3																					
5818	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibels to dock there. The main reason the diriibles couldn't dock there was because the dirigbles load. The load would cause stress. The wind pressure also is another reason dirigbles couldn't dock there. ""The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The dirigbles were docked by means of an electric winch. The electric winch was fine but, it also says ""the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" this could have been a safety concern also."	2	3		3																					
5822	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles during construction, according to the article The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted. The biggest obstacle of allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to dock their where the forces of nature, such as wind and gravity. As in the article, the ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was unsafe for both passengers of the dirigible and pedestrians below to be close to the blimp and the turbulent air. Also, the flammability of the hydrogen in the blimp caused a problem; it was very unsafe to have a possible fire hazard that was @NUM1 feet long, floating close over a very populated place such as New York City. In addition to that, laws that airships could not fly too close over urban areas prohibited dirigibles even coming close to the mooring mast over the Empire State Building. A test run with the U.S. navy dirigible Los Angeles proved that it was too dangerous and impractical; the dirigible could not even get close enough to tie up. All in all, the mooring mast over the Empire State Building was a genius idea, but too many obstacles sprung up for it to be in use."	4	4		4																					
5824	6	When attempting to add a mooring mask to the Empire State Building, the people who were adding it faced several impediments. Right away, the builders took the size of a dirigible into account. If there were something that large at the top of the building, the frame would be warped. To solve this problem, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars to change the original framework, to a more suitable one. Another obsticle faced by the builders of the mast, was that they had made sharp edges on the building that could damage a drigible attempting to dock. Also, they realized that the mast was above a large urban area, so if there would be an accident, bad situations would take place. There was also a law about aircraft traveling too low over a City. The drigible mooring dock atop the Empire State Building was not meant to be.	3	3		3																					
5825	6	There were many obstacles the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, The greatest obstacle of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were shifting because of violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, was neither practical nor safe. The one obstacle to their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. A morning mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on.	2	2		2																					
5829	6	The-builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. Safety was the biggest concern at each stage. The recent explosion of the Hindenburg showed potential problems in docking these aircraft. If a blimp was to explode in downtown New York, it could be a disaster. Another obstacle that would be faced is nature. The winds on the top of the building were constantly changing. The unpredictable wind atop the building made the idea of mooring a zeppelin very illogical. At this time, laws against flying low in urban areas were coming around. These would make for docking the airships to be illegal. The idea for making the Empire State Building a mooring post was an engineering feat but the actual usage of it was not practical.	3	3		3																					
5832	6	Builders trying to allow dirigibles to dock ontop of the empire state building faced problems. The dirigibles waight and the wind pressure would add stress to the Building. Wich @CAPS1 to be transmitted more then @NUM1 ft down to the buildings foundation. Construction wasn't the only problem. Most @CAPS2-American dirigibles are held afloat by hellium wich is extremely flammable and if it was @CAPS3 over busy + crowded New York streets many people could have been killed. Nature added to the problems. Wind currents had the pottential to push dirigibles Into @CAPS4 buildings, causing them to pop. The finall problem was @CAPS5 already implace wich didn''t allow low flying aircrafts. Builders faced Problems with Nature, @CAPS5, safety, and construction wich lead to the demise of the use of the mooring system.	3	3		3																					
5833	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, new friends would have to include more money. Anything done so top of a building so large would have to be balanced by strengthening the foundation. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the @DATE1 ft. building. Even if the front of the dirigible was anchored to the mooring, the back would be left to sway in the wind, Any accident or damage done to a dirigible over such a highly populated area such as downtown New York would have devastating results. In conclusion, the risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building outweighed the rewards. When dirigible travel became less practical, the plan was scrapped completely."	3	2		3																					
5836	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted explains the Empire State buildings past construction which led it to be the tallest building in the United States. Although the buider Al Smith had many obstacles, they faced of the hardest one when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles is allowing dirigibles to anchor their for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Another obstacle is letting dirigibles dock because of they need a place to tie up to a mast. It is stated, ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which haulled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast"" (L�sted @NUM1) This can be a problem because the body of the mast could swing in alot of breeze. Although there were many obstacles Al Smith worked his way around them and procceded to finish the Empire State building with corage to take on all obstacles."	1	2		2																					
5842	6	During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders had to face many @CAPS1 in attempting to allow driggibles to dock there.     In the reading selection The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted it discusses many of the @CAPS1 that were faced. For an example an obstacle they had to face was finding a landing area because there was a huge lack of suitable landing area in New York City. The second @CAPS1 they faced was how to make dirigible's global so they had a meeting with the president of a formed airship transport company would use the dirigable's service across the pacific ocean. The architects had meetings with the government about safeways of mooring airships to this mast.     The builders went through many @CAPS1 to use the dirigibles but eventually it wasn't enough to Put the Plan into affect.	1	1		1																					
5844	6	"The builders of the Empire States Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1, the author mentions that they had to consider the Hindenburg incident that took place on May 6, 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" says the author. They realized that the safety of the people has to come first in all scenarios. Also, another obstacle that Al Smith and the builders faced was docking the dirigible when people are down below. In paragraph @NUM2, The author says: ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 dirigibles are often docked in open fields, weights to hold down the back of the ship could be used safely. But above a highly populated area was out of the question because lead weights dangling high above pedestrians is a safety violation. The builders had many obstacles in designing the use of the mooring mast."	4	3		4																					
5846	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that a thousand-foot dirigible held by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. The obstacle they went through was to make the frame stronger. In paragraph @NUM1 it states the obstacle they went through to make the building stronger. ""the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" and ""The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners.""Other obstacles they went through was making sure the mooring mast was tall enough, and in paragraph @NUM2 Smith says, ""people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast."""	2	2		2																					
5847	6	"The builders from this excerpt faced quite a few challenges in trying to let dirigibles dock there. First off, the whole structure of the Empire State Building would need to be altered. Having a mooring mast atop the building with a dirigible attached would put great amounts of stress on the building's frame. The stainless steel in the structure's frame would need to be modified to be made stronger, however this is very costly. The excerpt says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Another challenge the builders faced was trying to deal with existing laws that had already been in place. The government did not want aircrafts flying too low over buildings. The excerpt says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against aircrafts flying too low over urban areas."" (paragraph @NUM2). The excerpt also says that this law would make it illegal for an aircraft to ever tie up to a building or even approach it."	3	3		3																					
5848	6	"There were three main obstacles in building a dock for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem was safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. were flammable because they ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" When the Hindenburg was destroyed, they realized that it would have been much worse over a highly populated city. Another problem was nature. Winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" and the back of the dirigible would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The third problem was that there was a law in place. As L�sted says, ""[there] was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""the building would have to be much taller in order for the ships to even approach it."	3	3		3																					
5851	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest problems the builders encountered were due to safety and actually mooring the dirigible itself. The hydrogen used within the dirigible was unsafe, as hydrogen is very flammable. If the hydrogen caught on fire, especially over a place as densely populated as New York City, many people would be harmed. Additionally, the builders were faced with the task of mooring the dirigible. Dirigibles were normally anchored with heavy lead weights. However, if one used those weights to anchor the dirigible above city streets, pedestrians below could potentially be injured. Actually allowing the dirigible to dock brought up another problem for the builders to address: if the dirigible was tethered to the mast on top of the Empire State Building, the dirigible would swings around and around the mast to wind. Ultimately, the builders were unable to address these issues and the Empire @CAPS3 Building is now used mainly as an observation deck and building.	3	2		3																					
5853	6	In the excerpt, The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building had a hard task on their hands. They were building the tallest building in the world and when Al Smith, the head in the construction of the building, said to make it taller things got even more difficult. Mainly because they wanted this newfound height to be used as a dock for dirigibles. What they didn't know is that it is a little more difficult than just tying up a blimp to a building. They had many obstacles at hand. The architects would have to modify the building because a thousand-foot dirigible moored on the building would add stress to the building. Dirigibles used hydrogen which is extremely flamable, if it were to catch on fire in downtown New York it would be desasterous. Nature poses a threat as well, the winds on  top of the building would cause the dirigible to swivle around. The final obstacle is there is a law that prohibits airships to fly to low in urban areas. In the end the plan failed.	3	3		3																					
5856	6	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by the author @ORGANIZATION1, the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. They were going to attach a single cable tether, but it would add stress to the buildings frame. They had to make the frame of the building stronger, which the desinged a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless stell tower that would illuminated from inside. When they tried it the wind was to strong, constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. They also couldnt due it because there was a law that airships flying to low over urban areas.	3	3		3																					
5858	6	There were many obstacles the builders had to take. One obstacle was the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified because the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have been transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. they had to pay ove sixty thousand dollars worth of modificautions in to the buildings framework.	1	2		2																					
5859	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles in order for dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to figure out a way for the dirigibles to attach to the Empire State Building, in order for ""refueling or service, and to let passengers on and off"" (� 6). The builders also had to figure out a way to securly attach the mooring mast to the top of the building. According to the text, with a dirigible attached by only a single wire to the building, more stress would be added to the building's frame so they could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the building Also because of this, the builders had to edit the foundation, so it would not collapes if a durigible was attached. Finally the builders needed to overcome the simple nature they did not the winds on top of the building were shifting constantly and they are in a densely populated city so if things went wrong, many people could be harmed"	2	2		2																					
5863	6	When the idea of creating a moring post for dirigibles on top of the empire state building there were several problems engeneers failed to reconize. The first was the problem of using highly flamable hydrogen to fill the dirigibles. The Hindenburg accident showed how horible it is one one of these explodes. The situation would have been much worse had it been over @NUM1 stories in the air. Secondly violent wind gusts would have made it  imposible to dock the dirigible atop the building, especially when the use of custimary lead weights would be both unsafe and not pratical. Lastly there was a law imposed before this project was ever a thought making it unlawful to fly any airship that low to an urban area.	3	3		3																					
5864	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", it is clear the architects were blind to the problems of the mast. Al Smith was becoming competitive to build the tallest building, and that was blinding him to potential risks. The people wanted to progress transportation of their time had not fully analized the future complications. In designing the mast, paragraph nine quotes, ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of a building... would add stress to the building's frame"". Even in early progression of the mast, it was clear this may not work. Two months later the building was reframed and the mast was added. May 6, 1937, owers of the building realized that if an accident like the destruction of 'Hindenburg' occurred atop the building, it would be devastation to happen above the densly populated Downtown New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle, as said in paragraph @NUM2, is nature itself. Winds at such high elevations were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous to have a tethered dirigible to swivel around and around the mast. Therefore the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building never fufilled it's destiny, but is now a site tourists flock to. By the end of the 1930's, the idea of dirigibles as future transportation was replaced by airplanes."	3	3		3																					
5865	6	"The builders - designers of the empire state building faced many obsticles in allowing dirigibles to dock at the top. The first, and most apparent one was the frame of the building. The article says, ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on the top of the @ORGANIZATION1 flat roof"" (@NUM1). The thousand foot tower would add extra strain on the building's frame. Next was the question of safety. Most international dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, a very dangerous gas, and if set on fire will make a huge explosion, as an example with the German dirigible the Hindenburg. If that same accident took place over New York City, many pedestrians would be hurt or killed. Also, the wind played a huge obsticle. The winds ""were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2) and therefore the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" which would be extremly unsafe. Lastly, and most simply, the law didn't allow for an airship to fly that low over urban areas. All of these obsticles put together caused the idea of using the building as a docking tower to fail."	4	3		4																					
5867	6	"The Empire State building is one of the tallest buildings ever built. It way because of this, that it was impossible for a blimp to dock on the mooring mast. The article by @ORGANIZATION1 titled ""The Mooring Mast"" describes well the problem blimps may have encountered. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wins on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" It's true, should a blimp try to moor there it would do nothing but twirl around the mooring mast. It could also crash into other buildings. It could tear up the mooring mast. There was so much the builders didn't look into."	2	2		2																					
5868	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the very huge building. The first obstacle realized was the safety issues. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, which is extremely flammable. Another tough obstacle that would be hard to avoid, was nature in general, like the author mentioned. The winds currents at the top of the building were sporadic, and that could be a huge problem the dirigibles trying to dock. However, the biggest obstacle that builders never realized, was that it was even illegal. The height of the empire State Building was too low for an aircraft of any sort dock on. It could be a danger to the urban areas underneath. Those were the main obstacles which caused the mooring mast, to fail.	3	3		3																					
5869	6	The builders didn't have a suitable landing area for the Dirigible, and if the Dirigible were to land on the Empire State Building's flat roof would add stress to the building. Money was one of the big issues the builders faced. In paragraph @NUM1 its saying that the greatest obstact was nature, The heavy winds on top of the building were shifting due to the violent air current. for the Dirigible itself would be swivel around the mooring mast, and for the safety of the people as well. Another obsticle was the law, that flying too low over urban areas were not allowed.	3	2		3																					
5872	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the first problems they faced was not being able to land. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This was a major problem because they had nowhere to land this object; this cannot modernize their traveling.Another problem that the builders faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This caused a problem because how were dirigibles from other countries visit us if they caused a threat to the safety of the people. They were not going to take that risk.A third problem was nature and the weather. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) The blimps had a very unsteady landing The winds would thrash them around. This was very unsafe @CAPS5 thats why it became an obsticale for the builders."	3	3		3																					
5873	6	The obstacles that builders faced at the empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there are. The possible dangers of having something fall on them. The hydrogen is highley flamable so the dirigible could blow up and ingor any one aroud it. The empire state building may not be strong enough to withstand the the moving of the @CAPS1 the back side moveing so much from the dangorouse winds, so the @CAPS1 could possibly pull off part of the building and could @CAPS2 nearby pedastrians.	2	1		2																					
5876	6	"Throughout the construction of the Empire State Building the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building: one obstacle the builders encountered was the fact that when a dirigible was attached to the building by a single cable, it would add to much stress to the buildings framework because of a combination of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure atop the massive @DATE1 foot structure. To solve this, the build had to do over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the frame of the building. Another obstacle encountered was the safety of docking the dirigible. One problem is that many dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. This made the owners realize how much worse an accident, but what happened to the Hindenburg, could be over such a densely populated area. Another safety problem was the high wind speeds. even when a dirigible would be docked to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would violently swing around because of the strong winds at @DATE1 feet. Also, usually dirigibles would be able to be weighted down in a field with lead weights to prevent movement, but ""using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1 with these two reasons, there was already a law against airships height in urban areas and by talking a dirigible at the building would break it. As seen by this paragraph there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	4		4																					
5877	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @PERSON1, the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. First of all, they needed a suitable landing area, which was a Mooring Mast. But before building the mast, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" Workers framed to the building all the way up to the 85th floor, But before the framing for the mast could take place, the roof had to be completed. Before advancing to the next stage of the project, the architects suddenly realized how dangerous and disasterous the result of it all could be. The ""Hindenburg"" set a good example on why they couldn't do it. The area around the building was too densely populated. The dirigible had a strong chance of resulting in a disaster over New York City, considering the violent air currents. The project was simply too risky, but was a great idea involving future transportation."	3	3		3																					
5878	6	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main problem was safety. When the front was masted to the building the back would move around. Another big problem was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Also, it was illegal for airships to fly that low over urban areas. Another obstacle was that the dirigible could not get close enough to the building because of wind.	3	2		3																					
5882	6	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there.

5883	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the author described the obstacles the builders of the empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An architect named Al Smith was a four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building after his years in office. He imagined the top of the Building to be a ""higher Calling"". He pictured it to be equipped for an age of transportation that was then the only dream of avation pioneers. It seemed possible in his eyes, till the obstacles turned up. The first obstacle that struck, was the lack of suitable area in New York City. They would have to clear about four blocks in the bussy city! The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, but it didn't plan out too well. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor. In the end, The greatest Obstacle was just nature itself."	2	1		2																					
5884	6	"A @CAPS1-@CAPS2 @CAPS3 idea of docking a dirigible to the top of the empire state building didn't seem so @CAPS1-@CAPS2 in 1929. Upon carrying out the idea to place a mooring mast atop the thousand foot building, problems quickly presented themselves The first problem architecs ran into was the construction of the building itself. The empire state building was never built to be able to hold a thousand-foot dirigible. The added weight would stress the frame of the building. As a solution to this issue, Al Smith, the four term governor of New York, put a ""quick fix"" in place. Smith invested sixty thousand dollars into strengthening the buildings support. Even with the strengthened frame, safety was still a main conflict that put the idea to rest. Along with the structural danger, hydrogen was a main source of weight reduction for dirigibles. Unlike helium, hydrogen is highly flammable was the Idea worth putting thousands of lives at stake through the dirigible blowing up? The people of New York did not wish to relive the Hindenburg fiasco right over their heads. The last major conflict in Smith's idea was nature itself. Air currents are a uncontrolable force of nature, especially when a thousand feet off the ground. Even if tethered, a dirigible would swivel @CAPS1 too much to be considered safe. The idea presented itself to be inconceivable. A mast was put atop the Empire State building, and the 102nd floor does, in fact, exist. Both of these building's features are out of use, proving to be unsafe to the public."	4	4		4																					
5885	6	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Often times something is predicted to work out a whole lot easier than it actually does, which is exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" For the builders, this was quite a project and took an extreme amount of time and effort. Also, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a huge obstacle that stood in the way of their plan. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Shifting winds due to violent air currents were also a huge issue. All of these things contributed to the mooring mast not ever becoming successful."	3	3		3																					
5891	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted there are many obstacles faced for the builders of the Empire State Building. One of the obstacles builders came across was safety because they were trying to build a mooring mast on the very top of the building for blimps to stop and refuel and such. If builders proceeded with that, it would have been a safety concern. Marcia L�sted writes ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S.A used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" That could be a huge problem if it was to explode in New York, many lives would be endangered. Another obstacle builders faced was strength, because since the mooring mast was going to be used for blimps, ""a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". That stress of the blimps load would add stress to the building's frame so steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened."	2	3		3																					
5895	6	"The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. For example, when the builder's decided to construct the mast they knew that it could not just be placed on the roof. It had to be somehow attatched to the foundation of the building because the dirigible, ""would add stress to the building's frame."" Also, after the Hindenburg disaster the builders realized that the hydrogen inside the dirigible ""is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to explode over New York City it would not only kill the people in the dirigible, but on the ground as well. Finally, the biggest obstacle of the mooring mast ""was nature itself."" The wind at the top of the building are very strong and would have swiveled around the mast. The many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building never allowed any dirigibles to land there."	3	3		3																					
5896	6	"When building a great task, many obstacles need to be faced. For the builders of the Empire State Building it was ones concerning the docking of dirigibles, or blimps. One was safety. The builders had to make sure it was safe to dock on and off the blimp, and it was safe to fly. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" People wouldn't be safe on a blimp that could expload at any moment. Another obsticle the builders had to face was building the mooring mast itself for docking. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The blimp wouldn't be able to hold correctaly to the mast and it would move around too much. It wasn't safe or practical for anyone. These are some obsticales many builders have to face, but the ones of the Empire State Building overcame them well."	3	3		3																					
5897	6	The builders of the Empire State Building planned to mount a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building, but they overlooked the potential problems in there design. A very big problem they faced was safety. After the Hindenburg, a German dirigible, blew up in flames in New Jersey, they realized it could have been a bigger problem if it blew up in New York. Nature also posed a problem. Air currents could violently sway the dirigible, on top of the building. And finally, they could not attempt this because it illegal. Ships were not allowed to fly too low over urban areas due to an existing law. These all made it much harder to put a mast on the Empire State Building.	3	2		3																					
5900	6	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 is a story that takes the reader through the obstacles and attempts builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, four-term governor of New York, planned to construct the Empire State Building after he was in office.Smith was competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the title of world's tallest building. So in 1929 he announced that the building would be 1,250 feet and he would do this by adding a top or hat to the building which would be distinctive. The idea was to add a mooring mass and observation decks to the top and have it be able to dock dirigibles, or blimps. Architects later realized that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by one cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of a dirigible's load with the pressure of wind would go all the way to the building's foundation. The plans that have builders working so hard on frame work and observation decks failed. It was not practical to dock a dirigible, it wouldn't be safe. By the late 1930s, the idea was given up on, but the Empire State Building is still open to one of the observation decks and is a very popular attraction in New York."	2	1		2																					
5902	6	One obstacle the builders had to face was the amount of wind that was blowing that high in the air. The dirigibles were so big that the wind had a lot of resistance on them and made them sway from the back.Another obstacle was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which is highly flamable Being filled up with such a flamable gas it could easily turn into a disaster. Especially with all the people who were so close to it on the ground.	2	2		2																					
5904	6	"The empire state building's construction workers attempted to build a dirigible dock on top of the world's tallest building but many problems occured during the process.

There are very strong and violent winds at the top of the building, the blimp could become a hazard if it was blown out of control A blimp hovering over hundreds of pedestrians in the city of New York is a definite hazard. There is also a law forbidding aircraft flying to low over populated areas. Having a mooring dock was a good idea but it was never really practicol or safe, many bad things could of happened if it was actually working."	4	4		4																					
5906	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the docking itself, nature and the overall construction of these dirigibles. There was all so an existing law against these air ships.Docking the dirigibles to the top off the Empire State Building would add a great amount of stress to the building. The builders would have to spend sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the building overall. The greatest safety issue was the construction of these balloons from outside the United States. They used hydrogen which was highly flammable, there was one incident on May 6, 1937 where the German dirigibles caught on fire. This was known as the Hindenburg's accident. Builders knew this can risk to the densely populated area of New York. But the greatest obstacle was nature itself. When the dirigibles would dock violent air currents would cause the back of the airship to swivel round and round the Mooring Mast. The law against airships were they were not allowed to fly low around urban areas.	3	3		3																					
5910	6	"Based on the article The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was of the the challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without some fish and landing space this was a challenge the builders of the building faced. Another challenge was making the dock practical, ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.."". This shows that a practical arrangement of the talking has yet been made, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced safety issues, "".... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast""-this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles has not been unsured yet, that it was still a challenge the builders faced area altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety."	2	4		2																					
5911	6	"Even though allowing dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building sounds like a good idea, it wasnt. There are many obstacles that prevent it from happening. With ""a @DATE1 ft dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also one of the greatest obstacles as the violent winds that constantly change due to violent air currents. Also, the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians on the street which isn't safe. The biggest obstacle was the fact that it's illegal for airships of flying low over urban areas which would also make it illegal for the dirigible to tie itself up to the building or even get close to it.

5912	6	"According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced three main obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The first obstacle was concern of public safety. Dirigibles from outside the U.S used hydrogen, which is a highly flammable element. An accident in a densely populated area like New York could be catastrophic. The second obstacle were the violent winds on top of the building. Using lead weights to tie down dirigibles was not practical, because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street. A mishap would send those heavy weights flying down and causing destruction. The third obstacle was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made the idea of allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building illegal and out of question"	3	3		3																					
5914	6	"In the excerpt of ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that prevented the docking of dirigibles at the Empire State Building was the use of Hydrogen rather than helium in dirigibles from out of the United States. This was a problem because hydrogen is very flammable. When the german dirigible was destroyed in New Jersey the architects of the Empire State Building realized how dangerous it was. Another obstacle faced by the builders was the weather. The weather affected the use of the mooring mast because ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" A practical reason why the mooring mast could not dock dirigibles At the Empire State Building was because of the law against airships. The law said that airships could not fly too low over urban areas making it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building. These are a Few of the many obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building which prevented the use of the mooring mast."	4	4		4																					
5919	6	When building the Empire State Building, the architects and engineers faced many problems. The first problem was reconstructing the buildings framework. This had to be done in order for the building to be able to undergo great amounts of wind pressure and stress from the dirigible. The next problem the workers encountered was the wind currents. The wind was so strong at the tip of the building, if a dirigible were to be docked to the mooring mast, it would be rotating around it depending on the wind currents. The final problem the architects faced was a law against a dirigible's height. There was an already existing law that stated airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These obstacles were but some of the many faced by the building team of the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5921	6	The obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock had some consequences. One of the obstacles to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Also, the Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire state buildings flat roof because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The last obstacle why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds	3	4		4																					
5923	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems with their idea of docking dirigibles on the top of the empire state building. One major impediment was the laws based around aircrafts. one law @CAPS1 air crafts from flying too low over urban areas. another problem the builders faced was the safety risks to docking dirigibles. Dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, an extremely flamable gas, and after the accident with the German dirigible Hindenburg explosion the builders realized the risk of accidents. Mother nature @CAPS2 the largest obstacle through, the height of the Empire State Building causes high speed winds which would fling the end of any dirigible around the mooring like a rag doll. The builders then realized all the risks to docking dirigibles and abandoned the idea.	3	3		3

5925	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the author describes many challenges the architects faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The architects had new challenges that would almost seem impossible to prevent at times. The height of the building, the weight of the dirigible against the building, and the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable, adds to the many obstacles the architects were faced with. The height of the building was a major problem for the architects. It was very difficult for pilots to safely maneuver around buildings, especially in a city with many buildings. The unpredictable winds meant the dirigibles could be blown into a building at any point. There was even a law against it that ""would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (para @NUM1). Another problem the architects encountered was the high flammability of the dirigibles. The dirigibles made in most other countries were made with hydrogen rather than helium. After another dirigible caught on fire people realized how much worse ""that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (para @NUM2). The biggest problem of all was the weight of the dirigibles on the massive height of the building. The architects saw that, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings' foundation"" (para @NUM3). They knew this was very unsafe for the passangers unloading and for the people in the building. Overall, the problems and challenges the architects faced were too strong for them to overcome."	4	4		3																					
5926	6	The engineers and constructors of the Empire State Building definitely faced some large and overwhelming complications when trying to build it to allow the dockings of dirigibles, or blimps. First off, from their original plan, right off the bat, they had to modify the building because they found the actual height of another building was taller. so they had to come up with something fast to fix that. Secondly, after the Hindenburg disaster, @LOCATION1 had realized how dangerous it was for zeppelins to fly over urban areas, so they put a law against it, so the whole idea was basically tossed. And to make matters worse, the violent gusts of air and updrafts wouldn't make docking on the Empire State Building very safe for passengers.	2	2		2

This law would make it illegal for a ""ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach it."	2	2		2																					
5934	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. If they were to succeed, they would have become a major aviation accommidation for transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. In order to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, the mooring mast needed to be constructed and put on to the top of the building. Simply adding the masts to the building was no easily reached task. The Empire State Building's frame needed to be modified so it could withstand the stress from the dirigible mounted onto the mooring mast. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to adjust the building's framework. Once the framework was adjusted, architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that was illuminated from the inside. This tower served as a mast for the building to come. Before the mooring mast could be constructed, the roof of the building had to be completed. Once the roof was constructed, the mooring mast was added with its own skeleton of steel. Once the entire project was finished, the owners of the Empire State Building realized that docking dirigibles would be much too dangerous. After all the rigorous work put into the mooring mast was completed, it became clear that it would never be used for its original purpose.	2	2		2																					
5939	6	"Although the builders tried hard to make their dream become a reality, there were a few obstacles that prevented that. The main obstacles builders faced were weather, the law, and safety concerns.The weather at the top of the building was very windy, and strong winds would cause major issues for the dirigibles landing. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another problem they faced was that there was a law effect preventing aircraft from flying too low over urban areas. Since New York is an urban area, no dirigibles would even be allowed to fly anywhere near the Empire State Building. The other main obstacle was a concern for safety. Hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, was used in many foreign dirigibles. It could cause a catastrophe if one ever exploded over New York, and there had already been an accident where ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937...""These obstacles were not just ones that the builders could ignore, and they ultimately prevented the intended use altogether."	3	3		3																					
5940	6	The obstacles faced by the Empire State building builders were. one was the existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Stated in @CAPS1 @NUM1. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. With the dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a cable tether would have put stress on the building therefore they would have had to make the structure of the building stronger	3	2		3																					
5942	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to overcome was that if a dirigibles, which could reach up to a thousand feet in length, was moored to the tops of the building it would add stress to the building's frame. This meant the steel frame of the building had to be strengthened and modified to deal with the added stress. The cost of the modifications was over sixty thousand dollars. The next challenge was discovered after the building was finished. This was the fact that having dirigibles moor at the Empire State Building was unsafe. This first reason why it is unsafe is that most dirigibles, not from the United States, used hydrogen into helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. This meant an accident like that of the Hindenburg could happen above the highly populated downtown area of New York. Another problem that arose after the construction was that the shifting winds on top of the building were too violent for the dirigible, which would swivel around the mooring mast. All these challenges along with an existing law they did not allow airships to fly too low over urban areas were the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building and is why only one dirigible was ever moored there.	4	4		4																					
5945	6	"The builders of the mooring mast plan the construction well, but did not consider the potential risks of the mast. One reason that the mast's fate was sealed was because of safety issues. Most dirigibles, or blimps, used hydrogen rather than helium. If one of these blimps were to fall from the sky, many people below would be killed. New York has many people that walk everywhere. The builders also needed to considered the violent winds at such a high altitude. These winds could blow the dirigibles around, making it difficult to keep them in one spot for passengers to board, and to refuel. The winds are constantly shifting. They could blow the blimps onto the spires on the Empire State Building, causing them to burst and fall to the ground below. Unfortunately, there is a law that prevents airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". I think that Al Smith was more focused on keeping his height record, more than the potential dangers of the mast."	3	3		3																					
5946	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. Do to the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they eventually shelved the idea. One of the obsticles the builders realized that if a forign dirigibles were to dock and have an accident with any heat or a spark, they would explode and fall to the ground, killing many men, women, and children, due to the chemicals that are used on forign dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, another obsticle they faced violent winds, that would knock the dirigibles around. ""Winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" All in all the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirgibles to dock eventually shelved the idea."	2	2		2																					
5952	6	"In a desperate attempt to revolutionize the way people traveled, the idea of the mooring was not thought over as well as it should have been. The number of problems and obstacles mounted higher and higher with the idea of mooring airships to a new mast atop the Empire State Building. One of these main obstacles was, while an airship was tethered to the building it would add stress, ""The stress of dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another obstacle faced with the mooring mast was one of safety. Dirigibles not from the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which is Highly flammable. Another obstacle to the construction was nature itself, with high, shifting winds due to violent air currents, a dirigible tethered to the mast would swivel around and around the Empire State Building, the only way to prevent this would be to tie the lead weights to the rear end, but massive dangling weights, hanging over one thousand feet above the public, was not the safest idea. A last obstacle that was faced with the fact that there was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. These were all obstacles that should have been thought through and realized before construction for the Empire State building's mooring mast ever begin."	3	4		4																					
5954	6	When the builders were almost ready to place the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, big problems became apparent to them that caused complications in docking dirigibles. One factor was that by law, dirigibles couldn't be that low above the city, as they could accidently  crash into a building and fall onto the crowds below. Another factor was the air currents around the tall buildings, especially the Empire State Building at a height of 1,250 feet. Even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the winds would violently rock it, and could crash against the building and fall to the streets below. A recent factor arose when the Hindenburg dirigible burst into flames from the hydrogen in it when it flew over New Jersey on May 6, 1937. Nobody wanted to risk that happening over New York City, either. So because of flammable hydrogen, violent air currents, and by law, the builders had complications when building the mooring mast to allow dirigibles to land there.	3	4		4																					
5956	6	There were many obstacles that the builders of the empire state building had to face. One obstacle being constructing a strong enough frame for the building so that a thousand foot derigible could be held by the single tether cable. Another obstacle that builders of the empire state building faced was safety how most derigibles from outside the U.S at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which made it very dangerous since hydrogen is very flammable. This made the constructors have to find a way of creating a landing field where the blimp would not touch any of the sharp spires above the empire state building. These were @NUM1 of the many obstacles that the builders of the empire state were faced with.	3	3		3																					
5957	6	"@ORGANIZATION2's article ""The Mooring Mast"", explains the many problems with using the peak of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles. First of all, dirigibles that travelled internationally were filled with Hydrogen, a very flammable gas. Having another Hindenburg-style disaster over New York City would be very dagerous. Also, the winds at the top of the spire are rapidly changing and unpredictable, making an approach dangerous. It would normally be okay for a blimp to land in a windy area, because lead weights could be fastened to ropes holding the blimp down. Without landing on the ground, such as just attaching to the spire, there was no way to weigh down the blimp to stabilize it. Finally, a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas, making a docking at the Empire state illegal. Many practical reasons crushed the dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State."	3	3		3																					
5963	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced four main problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems was solved, the other three were not. The first obstacle was that since each dirigible would be connected to the top of the building by a single cable, enormous stress would be put on the frame of the building. This was solved by simply reinforcing the frame of the Empire State Building, but it cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the modifications. The second obstacle was not so easily solved. Dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen to stay afloat. Hydrogen is highly flammable, and the example of the Hindenburg blimp that burst into flame alerted the owners and builders of the Empire State Building to how dangerous an accident like that, especially in densely populated New York City, could be. The third obstacle also proved impossible to solve - because of the high speed of the winds at the top of the building, there would be no way for a dirigible to @CAPS1 safely. During the only test, the Los Angeles navy dirigible could not get close enough to @CAPS1 because of the high winds. It would have been all too easy for the dirigible to spin out of control and hit a spire on a nearby building. Lastly, there was already a law in place that prevented dirigibles from flying too close to urban areas, which would make it illegal to @CAPS1 or fly a ship in New York City.	4	4		4																					
5964	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the wind was to fast for the builders at that altitude. This shows that they didn't want any dirigibles to fall on any stores below. Second, they didn't finish the building because the building couldn't hold all the weight that they wanted to put on top of it. Third, hydrogen is highly flammable and could catch on fire easily. In brief, there were many problems that made the Empire State Building a bad idea to dock a dirigible.	2	2		2																					
5965	6	Durining the @DATE1 and the 1930s, there was a fierce competition arising over constructing the largest building. To set the Empire State Building apart from the @ORGANIZATION1 decided to put a mooring mask for dirigibles. This would have both meaning and make the Empire State Building the worlds largest building. The mooring mask was certin to fail for a few reasons. For one, forign dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is very flamable and would cause a huge fire @CAPS1. Another reason is above the Empire State Building there are strong winds and currents that are constantely shifting. This would make it very difficult to control the dirigible. Pilots unable to control the dirigible would have great difficulty @CAPS2 their dirigible. Lastly the mooring dock failed because of the law. This law stated that it is illegal to fly air ships to low over urban areas. On 1931 @CAPS3 Clavan @CAPS4 the @CAPS5 of the mooring mask. By the late 1930's the Idea was dead.	3	3		3																					
5967	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were mainly due to structeral and safty issues. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" This problem required over sixty thousand dollares' worth of modifications to the buildings framework. Although structural issues were a problem, the safety of the pidestrians created a even bigger obstacle for the builders.Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium which created huge fire hazzards ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, such as downtown New York"" (paragraph @NUM2). Even though the exsisting law against airships flying too low over urban areas prevented dirigibles from mooring at the Empire State Building, the biggest obstacle of them all was nature itself. The dirigibles shells could be punctured by the winds constantly shifting due to violent air currents."	4	3		4																					
5968	6	"The builders have faced many obstacles, from laws to future disasters. There were several problems with the design and location of the mooring mast One problem was that ""the winds on top of the building, were constantly shifting."" Even though the architects adjusted the design of the mast, it was still too dangerous to land a blimp.Another major problem, was the dirigibles themselves They were filled with combustable hydrogen. If a blimp was to catch fire, like the Hindenburg, the debris would fall on the pedestrians' below. The last problem was a law that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas.""In conclusion, due to laws, the dirigibles and nature, the mooring mast was not used."	2	3		3																					
5974	6	The were many obstacle's the builder's of the Empire State Building had to face in attempt to allow the docking of dirigible's. There was no way architects could drop a mooring mast on top of the building's smooth roof. If a thousand foot dirigible overshadowed the top of the building with only one cable tether, stress the building's frame would be added instantly. Stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would need to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation. Another obstacle for the builder's was that the building's steel frame would have to be strengthened to accommodate with this new design. The greatest obstacle in launching this new design was nature. Architects would needed to consider the constant shifting of winds due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would be unsturdy. The fact that this design would be dangling above the pedestrians on the street, would worry the architects concern of the population. Architects also had to deal with the law against airships traveling too low above urban areas. This law would state the forbidden right of one to tether a large ship to a bulding, or even approach the area. Although there were attempts of dirigible's to reach a bulding, the entire idea was dropped, much to the architects despite.	3	3		3																					
5975	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the fact that dirigibles contain highly flammable gases. If the blimp was docked over a large city like New York City, it would be very dangerous if a blimp did catch on fire. Another obstacle was that the docking system would not work as well as planned, nor would it be safe. These airships are at the mercy of the winds and weather. In normal cases of docking dirigibles on open landing fields, they are weighted down on the front and back. If the blimps were to stay in place on the Empire State Building, they would need to have a weight on the back as well as the front, which would end up dangling over the city. Without the weight on the back, the blimp would spin around the mooring mast. Finally, the height at which the dirigibles would have to be would not be safe. If the blimp were to the blown by the wind, the blimp would crash into the pointy tops of nearby buildings. These are the obstacles the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5976	6	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  The first obstacle the builders faced was that the building itself would need to be modified.  The architects in charge of adding the mooring mast realized that if they were to add the mast as-is, and start mooring dirigibles to it, then there would be too much stress put on the empire state buildings frame.  For this reason they first had to make @MONEY1 worth of changes to the building in order to sufficiently strengthen it's frame (paragraph @NUM1).  The second obstacle which builders faced in trying to make it possible to more dirigibles to a mast on the empire state building was just general safety.  After the hindenburg disaster of 1937 took place, it became clear to the architect in charge of the project how truly catastrophic an accident like that would of been if it occurred over as highly populated a place as @CAPS1 (paragraph @NUM2).  It wasn't just possibility of catastrophic disaster which added to the worry about safety though.  Considering the constant violent wind gusts which happen at the height of the mast, architects realized that any dirigible moored up there would be constantly swinging rapidly around the mast.  The way this problem is solved when mooring dirigibles on ground is through the hanging of weights on it's back, yet this would present yet another safety issue because of the weight was to fall on the people below it could easily kill somebody (paragraph @NUM3).  The final obstacle architects faced was a law outlawing a dirigible flying so low near urban areas in the first place.  In the end, the fact that there was so many obstacles prevented the idea of mooring dirigibles there from ever becoming reality at all.	3	4		4																					
5977	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One obstacle they faced was nature itself. It says in the exerpt that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" This could have led to major accidents if the dirigibles were allowed to dock here. Another obstacle they faced was that these dirigibles could not fly to low over urban cities. It says in the excerpt that ""these was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" But before the idea was even dropped, two dirigibles attempted to reach the building. The first one could not reach the building because of forceful winds. The second airship attempted a stunt to drop off a bundle of news papers. They didn't have the right equipment so they had to have a worker catch the bundle of papers that were attached by a rope. These obstacles were very important to be construction of the mast because it's probably saved the lifes not only the aviators but the people that lived in urban cities below."	3	3		3																					
5978	6	"In the @DATE1's, dirigibles were known as the transportation of the future. After the Empire State Building was built, the builder's attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. There were three main reasons that prevented the builders from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, at the top of the Empire State Building. ""The one obstacle to there expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Al Smith thought that if a mooring mast was added to the top of the building, it would allow dirigibles to anchor there for hours. But it was not easy for the architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moorin Mast was nature itself."" The violent air currents from the wind, would caused the back of the ship to Swivel around the moorin mast. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire state Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" In the end two dirigibles attempted it, but it did'nt work."	4	3		2																					
5986	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of them was not being able to just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A dirigible attached the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would stress the building frame. Its weight and air pressure would weaken the foundation of the Empire State Building. They had to make sixty thousand dollars worth modifications to the frame work so it could be strong enough to with stand the weight of the dirigibles. Another problem the mooring mast not fulfilling its purpose, which should have been thought about before it was built; safety. Many countries outside the U.S used hydrogen instead of helium, hydrogen is really flammable. There was an inccident where a blimp was destroyed in a fire due to hydrogen in their balloon. The biggest challenge was the wind above the building. The wind was constantly shifting because of violent air currents. If the blimp was tethered to the mooring mast, the back would turn on the mooring mast. Blimps use weights to land in open fields but couldn't over the Building because weights dangling over pedstrians wasn't safe. Builders had troubles attempting to allow blimps to dock there.	3	3		3																					
5987	6	"During the attemp in building a docking station for dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles that made this idea less and less possible. One huge problem was due to the building's foundation. A swinging blimp, which can be up to a thousand feet in length, on top of the building would add a huge amount of stress. This meant extra money would need to be dumped into the strengthening of the foundation and framework, in order to support a huge zeppelin on the mooring mast. Since the building tops out at 1,250 feet in altitude, fierce air currents rip through the top of the building. This caused impossible docking conditions because the blimp could hit the building and pop. Due to the flammability of hydrogen this dangerous eruption could wreck havoc on the densely populated city below. Refering to the Hindenburg explosion in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 1937, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated area."" Due to the mainly safety reasons the Docking station for dirigibles was never built."	3	3		4																					
5989	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the very important obstacles they had to face was the thousand-foot dirigible adding stress to the buildings frame. Therefore, ""... have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@NUM1) @CAPS1, the builders face the obstacle of safety. Dirigibles used hydrogen, ""... rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2. line @NUM3) The greatest obstacle faced by the builders was nature. As the winds were shifting at the top of the building, the back of the dirigibles swiveled around the mast. Previous solutions; ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights..."" (@NUM4. line @NUM3-5) were not safe with the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Lastly, an obstacle they faced was that there was a ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM6. line @NUM7) this made it so the dirigibles could not even approach this area. There were several obstacles faced when the builders were trying to make the Empire State building a docking station."	3	4		4																					
5990	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacle while building it, some of those obstacles being saftey, the technology they had, and, the planning that they put into building the mooring mast. There problems with the safety of the mooring mast was that, dirigibles that were from countries other than the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen instead of helium. Hidrogen is very flammable so the risk of a fire in the dirigible was very great. Also another problem the builders faced with safety was that the winds on top of the building would be much too great to succesfully land a dirigible. The problems that the builders faced with technology was that they didn't have the technology to succesfully land a @DATE1 ft dirigible at the top of a tower using a single cable because it would add stress to the buildings frame, and the stress from the wind pressure would be hazardous to the buildings frame. The obstacles that the builders faced with the planning of the mooring mast was that they didn't plan well enough and that they should have seen that the mast would be a failure from the start.	3	3		3																					
5996	6	"Being an architect and construction worker is one of the hardest jobs in the world, especially at an elevation of @NUM1 feet. Building the Empire State building was no easy task. An even more challenging task was building a mooring mast, a docking area for dirigibles, on top of the Empire State Building. Since the building had a flat roof, ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building."" Architects had to build an extension in the shape of a rocket jutting out from the flat roof. The Architects also realized that having a single cable at the top of the extension to hook onto the dirigible, would add tremendous stress to the building. They had to find a way to ease the stress to the building's foundation. Although the architects faced challenges they did overcome them and planned to put their ideas into action."	1	2		2																					
5997	6	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle being to much stress on the buildings frame. The dirigible would somehow have to be connected to the frame, which was @NUM1 feet below. Another problem the builders faced was safty. The workers wanted to use hydrogen to keep the dirigibles afloat, but realized hydrogen is flamable. Other problems where nature and law. Nature's winds would complicate the dirigibles from staying still. Law stated that the dirigibles would be flying to low for urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that led to a plan failed.	3	3		3																					
5999	6	The obstacles the builders had to go through to allow dirigibles to dock there was by a electrical winch. By tying it to the mast, The wind pressure. Need to be in a open field and weighed down in the back with lead wieghts. Try to tie the building but it was illiogal so they coun't do it. Because of the force ful winds the also couldn't tie it on to the building. The dirilage mooring equiment was never stalled in either. Dirilgables and their passengers had quietly dissappeared and didn't become transportantion instead had given away to airplanes.	2	1		2																					
6003	6	"According to the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's ""The Mooring Mast"", the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When Al Smith was first planning the structure and use of the mass, he seems to be overambitious. In paragraph @NUM1, the reader gets the sense of how competitive Smith was, which is a quality that can get in the way of practicality. Smith's determination to have the Empire State Building be the tallest was an obstacle because it was what first initiated the idea of the mooring mast. Although it is made clear to the section ""Designing the Mast"" that a lot of planning went into the building of the mast, the extra effort needed for this was an obstacle as well. The mast delayed completing the whole building and as @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM2, the mast caused unsolved problems and postponements. A significant reason to the failure of the mast was the issue of safety because the dirigibles were highly flammable. As it also says in paragraph @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" These both show the impracticality of the installment of a dirigible dock, revealing the largest obstacles the builders faced. Because ambition was more important than practicality in the building of the mooring mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles and failed."	3	1		2																					
6005	6	"From what seemed to be a very possible way to make the Empire State Building famous to relizing how hard it was going to be the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obsticals in allowing dirigibles to dock.

Not only did the builders have to worry about structural but the winds.

6006	6	The builders of the Empire State building were having many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Their first problem was that they could not drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire state building. Mainly because it's only held by a single tether, and because it would add stress to the buildings frame. Another @CAPS1 is that the wind speeds were so much greater in the top of the building that it pushed the dirigibles away from the docking station. Also, most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium to stay aloft, and hydrogen is extremely flammable. For the creators of the building, The idea just seemed unpractical, a dirigible would be to hard to keep in one place dangling @NUM1 feet in the air above New York City.	3	2		3																					
6007	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

This would mean that there was not much room for the dirigibles when it was not in year.

6014	6	The builders faced many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.  First of all, tying a dirigible with one cable would add tremendous weight to the frame of the building.  In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of @MONEY1.  After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable.  After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City.  Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air.  The law also hindered Al Smith's idea.  The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas.  When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings.  The idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes.	3	3		3																					
6015	6	"In the excerpt, ' The Mooring Mast' I Marcia Amidon L�sted, the constructors of the empire state building faced many obstacles while trying to create a docking place on such a tall building. Obstacles a law against airships flying to low and nature itself made it hard to create such a place in paragraph @NUM1, it says ' The other practical Reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."" There was alReady a strong argument on building the mast but Al Smith ignored it. This law made it illigal for ship to ever tie up to the building. In paragraph @NUM2, the author tells why nature was a problem she says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" Already the @CAPS1 is showing signs of the danger ahead if they pursued the idea any farther. Drigibles moored in open landing fields and could be weighed down by lead weights. However, using these in the Empire State Building where they would be dangling in the air wasn't practical nor safe. All those Reasons contribute to the Reason why docking wasn't allowed."	2	3		3																					
6016	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The greatest one being violent winds so high up. The back of the zeppelin would swivel around the mooring mast. There was also the fear of it blowing into the sharp spires of nearby buildings, causing it to burst. They couldn't use lead weights to hold it in place, because it wouldn't be safe to have them dangling above the streets. There was, at the time, a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, for simelar reasons. This would have made it illegal for a zeppelin to dock there anyway. These are some obvious problems, overlooked in the design of the mooring mast.	3	3		3																					
6017	6	"In the nonfiction excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the architects faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle the architects faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. There was nowhere to land the blimps. ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuling or service, and to let passengers on and off."" This quote is saying that they needed to build a mooring mass to overcome the obstacle. The second obstacle they faced was the architects couldnt just drop a mooring mass on top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by single cable wether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" This quote is saying the stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted and the still frame of the building would have to modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. The third obstacle which was the greatest obstacle was the successful use of the mooring mast. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote is saying the nature of the mooring mass itself was dangerous because the back of the ship would swevel around the mooring mass. This made the mass unsafe. Those three obstacles were what the architects faced in order to build the mooring mass, in which to compete having the highest building in the world."	3	3		3																					
6018	6	"There were several obstacles to the success of the construction. Perhaps the main obstacle, the obstacle that nothing could be done about, was the wind itself. On paragraph @NUM1 it mentions how the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These giant- balloon like machines would constantly swivel around the mooring mast even if they were tied down. The Hindenburg disaster in May 6, 1937 also proved how dangerous it would be to have blimps filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas over a densely populated area, like downtown New York. The project was also held back by existing laws about flight in an urban area. ""It was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" -says the author on paragraph @NUM2. Incoming blimps would simply be flying too low against law for this to work."	3	3		3																					
6019	6	"The empire State Building builders faced  different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders first had to learn about the mooring lines. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations ""to learn more about them first hand. The builders also had to worry about the frame of the Empire State Building. The frame ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accomodate this new situation."" This meant the builders would have to go back and work on the frame again. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building caused the builders to face different obstacles."	3	1		1																					
6021	6	There were many obstacles that the architects working on the mooring mast of the Empire State building had to face. The first was the fact that derigibles were not becoming the next transportation craze. Without derigibles to use the mast, it would serve no purpose. Another obstacle was the laws in place that prevented derigibles from flying too low over urban areas. So no dirigibles could have legally docked at the mast anyway. A final obstacle was nature. Fierce winds at the top of the building could spin the dirigibles around, making docking dangerous and impractical.	2	2		2																					
6022	6	When building the Empire State Building, builders faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. From the reading excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted stated that dirigibles were as long as one thousand feet, tha't four blocks in New York City. This brought up the first obstacle, which is they have no where to land this thing. They couldn't put it above new york because of an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Architects also had to find a way to redesign the building so that it support the weight of the dirigible. The biggest obstecle, they faced was nature. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing and although it would be tied down to the building the back of it would still be swirling, they didn't have a way to fix that, because usually dirigibles were weighed down with cylinder blocks in an open field and it would be to risky to do that over a populated area.	2	3		3																					
6023	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 wanted to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building for refueling and services and to let passengers off and on. However, the builders of the Empire State Building went through many obstacles to allow this to happen. ""The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION3 in Lakehurst, New Jersey"" (�@NUM1). They had to meet with experts and analyze if that was going to be a successful idea. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed....the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (�'s @NUM2 & @NUM3). Another obstacle that the builders had to deal with was nature. the winds up there were very strong, therefore the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was not successful."	2	2		2																					
6029	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, L�sted addresses many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to make many adjustments to the building's framework, the safety of the dirigibles was dangerous, and nature itself posed as a huge obstacle for the builders.First, the architects realized that they could not drop a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State Building because of the stress it would add to the building's framework. As L�sted states, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" The architects then had to make adjustments which would strengthen the building to allow the docking of the dirigibles. These improvements cost the architects @MONEY1!The second obstacle faced by the builders was the safety of the dirigibles. At the time most of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen which was highly flammable. The architects saw how dangerous this could be when they witnessed the destruction of the German Hindenburg blimp. If the same thing was to happening in New York, which is a densely populated area, it could cause serious damage.Another obstacle the builders faced when trying to dock the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was nature. The winds at the top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting which would cause the blimp to be very unstable. The blimp is usually weighted down by lead weights but in New York this would not be safe he cause they would be dangling above pedestrians. The many obstacles faced by the architects caused the docking of the blimps to be unsuccessful."	3	4		4																					
6035	6	Obstacles builders faced in constructing the Empire State Building to allow the attempt of a dirigible to dock were blind. The tuge and pull of the unforecast wind made the dock dangers for passangers and the buildings foundation. However, making such attemps were eleagl for dirigibles to fly over urban areas, incase of failer. Spires as well made the drop impossible for them to approach also in case of puncher. Spending sixty thousand on modification to moor mast on the @ORGANIZATION2 for the safe dock of dirigibles. The idea was lost to the creation of the mordern new airplane.	2	3		3																					
6036	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were. The used of hydrogen rather than helium because hydrogen is highly flammable. The obstacles of it was nature itself. There's always strong and dangerous winds on top of the building. So it makes it possible for the dirigible to swivel around which is dangerous. Dirigibles moored in the open landing fields could be weighed down but, using these at the Empire State Building can dangling high above pedestrians which is not safe. Another reason is the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. If the dirigible blows the sharp spires of the building can puncture the dirigible's shell. These are the reasons and obstacles why its hard to attempt the dock of the dirigibles.	4	3		4																					
6037	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is one paragraph @NUM1 ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."	1	1		1																					
6039	6	They had problems with the dirigibles trying to land it thyre. The dirigible could have caught fire and it would have been worse. It was dangerous to attach piece to the part.The high wind was a problem.The dirigible could burn up fall down and people would die below.	1	2		2																					
6041	6	When the Empire State Building was being constructed, the main idea was to create a mooring mast for dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. However, being the first of its kind, this idea came with many obstacles. Before constructing the mast, they had to stabilize the building with steel framework and other modifications as stated in paragraph nine. Dirigibles are very long, and the previous structure would not be enough to support it with the high blowing winds. Safety was also an issue with adding the mooring mast. Blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is extremely flammable, instead of helium. If something were to happen, and the blimp caught fire, that could threaten the safety of cilvians. After the mast was constructed, the high speed winds were an obstacle yet again, and they wouldn't even allow dirigibles to come close to the building. Despite how unique the idea of letting dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building was, there were many obstacles getting in the way of making the idea successful.	3	3		3																					
6047	6	"The lack of the landing area. Also the body of the dirigible can Swing Is another obstacle that the Empire State Building faced. The other obstacle they faced, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles were flying to low over the urban areas and that is a law against airships. The @ORGANIZATION2 from Los Angeles could not get close enuff to tie up the dirigible do to the wind. Alot went wrong with transportation of Passengers so they stoped doing that."	2	3		3																					
6048	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 the author States ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the @ORGANIZATION2 ing's flat roof."" This was true because it would ""add stress to the buildings frame. Also paragraph @NUM2 states ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There were violent air currents, and landing techniques weren't promising. The builders had to use much caution because the idea of having a dirigible land at that height was neither practicle or safe."	2	2		2																					
6050	6	"The invention of the mass on top of the Empire State Building was an undeveloped idea that created created a new means of transportation but arrive with numerous flaws. One obstacle the engineers faced was resting a one thousand foot dirigible over a twelve hundred fifty foot building because with combined wind pressure this would put stress on the building's structure and allow it to collapse. This transportation was also extremely dangerous to the public because many foreign dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable (paragraph @NUM1)."" Not only this, if builders ever allowed dirigible's to dock on the building, the back of the airship would spin around the mooring mast due to shifting violent air currents as stated in paragraph @NUM2. In paragraph @NUM3, it says that an existing law would prohibit airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made docking dirigibles atop of the Empire State Building illegal because dirigibles would be above the people which was against the laws. All of these obstacles made the transportations a failure and as a result the use of the mast had disappeared."	3	3		3																					
6052	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was installing the mooring mast, the architects couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof because the weight of the blimp moored at the top held by a single cable tether would add stress to the frame. The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would transmit all the way to the building's foundation. The builders would have to modify and strengthen to build to accommodate the new situation. Another obstacle they faced was the cost, because it would take over sixty thousand dollar's to make the proper modifications to the building's framework. Also safety was another major obstacle, they would have to make people were going to be safe, because Most dirigible from other countrie's used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The area's were densely populated an accident over the city would be much worse. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, but winds on the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast the back would swivel around. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down by weights, but using these would be dangerous dangling that high above pedestrians. Many obstacles were practical reasons why they couldn't moor at the Empire State Building. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas and make it illegal for ships to tie up to the building. So long these obstacles were faced in attempting to allow docking.	3	4		4																					
6053	6	Based ON this excerpt the builders faced A few problems when building the Empire State Building. One problem was actually docking the Zeppelin's or dirigibles. The wind was vicious at @NUM1 ft in the Air. Another problem the buiders faced with saftey. Since most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium it was A fire saftey issue. This occurred After the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a Fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, ON may 6, 1937.	2	2		2																					
6054	6	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders needed more support for the building's framework. They had to use over sixtey thousand dollars to buy correct modification. Lack of a suitable landing area. There are alot of obstacles for the dirigibles.The builders needed more support for the building's framework. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). They had to use over sixty thousand dollars to buy modifications for the stressed frame. ""Over sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). There was a lack of suitable landing area. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para 6).In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, this is how the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
6055	6	"In the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" Architects cannot just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof. The building would have had an extreme amount of pressure on it. In addition, along with the pressure, the dirigibles would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The builders needed to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. This also cost a great deal of money. Furthermore, ""the greatest reason was safety."" The slightest mistake in building the mast, could affect every person in the building. In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders needed to be aware of all the citizens surrounding the building. All in all, these obstacles determined the fate of the mast."	3	2		3																					
6056	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Another obstacle was the buildings structure if the blimp had docked there would be stress on the building ""would add stress to the buildings Frame"". The last obstacle was the wind would push the blimp around every which way when docked on the tower ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"""	3	3		3																					
6057	6	The mooring mast on the Empire State Building was intentionally built for dirigible docking. Although the problem with allowing that to happen was not questioned at the time of the mast's construction, safety issues were a major concern. Most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen gas, which is extremely flamable. The news of the German dirigible Hindenburg being destroyed in flames greatly concerned the owners of the Empire State Building. They imagined how much more worse that would be if a dirigible combusted on the building and in a dense population of Downtown New York. This caused the builders of the Empire State Building to reconsider allowing dirigibles dock at it's mooring mast.	2	2		2																					
6059	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there was that he realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building, also Some of his opinions were proven wrong because of facts. Another obstacle was trying to accomplish everything he says he was going to do On time. He needed to react more realistic than what he was thinking Of doing. Most obstacles had to do with ""nature itself."" Such as the wind which would make it swivel around."	1	1		1																					
6060	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it explains how the developing idea of landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building was eventually rejected due to many obstacles. The first design flaw that the engineers @CAPS2 was the stress the dirigible would add to the building's frame. A mass that size attached to the building by a single cable tether would be @CAPS1 in the building's foundation. The greatest obstacle the engineers @CAPS2 in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. With the use of hydrogen, the dirigibles are highly flammable. This would have created a dangerous situation ove a ""densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The final obstacle the builders @CAPS2 was the wind. The winds at that height were extremely strong. Chapter @NUM1 it says, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would create a dangerous situation for the ship's passengers. In ""The Mooring Mast"", it described how it would be nearly impossible to land dirigibles atop the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
6064	6	Allowing dirigibles stock at the Empire State Building was never possible because of the obstacles that the architects faced. First, nature was against the builders. The strong winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting, which proved a hazard to dirigibles. Mooring dirigibles would lead weights was out of the question because they were a danger to pedestrians. Another obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. The final obstacle was that a dirigible could be accidentally ignited and fall on New York. The destruction of the Hindenburg made clear that it was not possible to have a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
6066	6	"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, workers and builders try to make a docking area for Dirigibles (blimps). In the process in doing so they @CAPS1 many obstacles. First, obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. They really should've thought to make it bigger in the first place. Workers did work but was not enuff. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. If they were good builders and knew what they were doing and then they would know that wind up higher gets ruffer. Bacicaly should have thought things through a little more; lastly, was the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Should have checked if there were ney laws which there was; Also, all that work for nothing. All these obstacles that the workers and builders @CAPS2 were things that could have been prevented, so money and time did not have went to waste."	3	2		3																					
6067	6	"In the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock here. One example of this is ""The Obstacle to their expanded use into New York City was lack of a suitable landing area"". This shows that the mooring mast is going to be a problem because its lacked of a suitable landing area, meaning it's to difficult for landing, it's not ment for docking. Another example is 'A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building frame.' This shows that the building is not stable enough for landing for a final example ""The greatest obstacles to the successful use of a mooring mast was nature itself.' This shows that the weather can change, and it will affect its landing. These examples show how in the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by @ORGANIZATION2, the obstacles that the builders faced."	2	2		2																					
6068	6	"The use of the mast on the empire state building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. Violent winds, the amount of structural support and anti low-flying aircraft laws made it impossible to use. The high winds would spin the back of the aircraft and therefore the entire dirigible around the spire, and the structural support of such was extremely risky. The main interfering point however was an, ""existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". These things inevitably lead to the mast not being put to use."	2	2		2																					
6069	6	"The obstacle the builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles or ""blimps"" to dock on the Empire State Building were nature itself. The reason nature is the obstacle for blimps to dock on the building is because the wind currents moving the end of the blimp. If the blimp is moving by the wind while passangers are leaving or getting in, it would be very easy to fall off. Another obstacle the builders had with docking the blimps is the lead weights dangling from the end of the blimps. Those weights were used to keep the blimp from shifting directions due to the wind currents but it was a concern for the safety of the Street Pedestrians. On @CAPS1 @NUM1 of ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, it quotes that ""... that using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above Pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical nor safe"". This quote proves that putting weights on the back of the blimp would be dangerous. If they some how fall off then someone could get really hurt on the streets."	3	3		3																					
6073	6	"Based on the excerpt there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was the dirigibles were too big and could be dangerous.

This shows that it will be harder to build the mast than expected. Another obstacle the builders ran into was that the building would have to be modified.

6074	6	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example they needed a suitable landing area which they could not do very easily. They needed to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, but the architects could not do that with no problem. It took a lot of work. The @CAPS1 says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 they had an idea to add to make it work, would add stress to the building and take it down. The wind pressure had a great deal on that also. The winds were making it hard to keep the Dirigibles stable. They wanted to add weights to hold it down but that wouldn't be good for the people below. The @CAPS1 says ""Could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. They faced way to many problems."	3	2		3																					
6076	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had a lot of struggles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, they had to consult with experts to see if the equipment was safe enough. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION2 at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Next, they had a hard time dropping the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. They would have to us @MONEY1 worth of modifications to strengthen the building's framework. They were never going to have this happen in the first place, because of the safety issue, the hydrogen gas in the dirigible is highly flammable. The biggest issue though, was nature. The winds on top of the building made it very hard to work, and it got very violent.	3	2		3																					
6077	6	The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their Idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude.                                                 The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas.	3	3		3																					
6078	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all due to the addition of the mooring mast. First, the architects had to modify the steel frame of the Empire state building. The architects knew that the large mooring mass could not be simply placed on the building flat roof. Marcia Amidon L�sted explains tha ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame"". (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Because, the building needed to adapt to the situation, they spent over @MONEY1 to modify the framework. Another obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building had to face were the safety issues of the new mooring mast. These concerns about the safety arrose from an incident when the Hindenburg, a German dirigible was destroyed by fir at Lakehurst, New Jersey. Because, the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium the risks were higher. Helium is more flammable. L�sted writes ""the owners of the Empire State realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (L�sted @NUM2). The Empire State Building was just an impractical location for an airship dock. Finally by the late 1930s it was certain that the mooring mass would not fulfill its purpose because dirigibles had now given way to airplanes."	4	4		4																					
6079	6	The builders that constructed The Empire State Building faced many obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly they could not just simply drop a mooring mast atop the building and hope for the best. The mast would add a large amount of stress to the framework, also factor in the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure, and the framework would need to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a key problem the builders ran into. Most dirigibles were highly flammable, and to have them fly over such a populated city as New York would be impractical. As well as their flammable characteristic there was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So therefore it was illegal to tie up, or even approach the building. The last obstacle the builders ran into was the wind. The winds at that height were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. There was also the fear that the wind would blow the ships into the sharp spires of another building. Including the obstacles and the loss of interest in dirigibles was the result in the discontinuation of the project.	3	4		4																					
6080	6	"New technology, especially in aviation,requires work to be done, thus causing many obstacles to overcome. In order to make this mooring mast on the Empire State building a success, the builders would need to know how to keep the dirigible hooked to the building and able to set passengers on and off. A quote from the text supporting this would be ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". (6). But the passengers were not the only obstacle the builders had to surpass. The stress a dirigible would put on the building would be too great, meaning they also had to remodel the actual building. The text supports this with, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@NUM1). Even with all these modifications, however, the mooring mast was doomed to failure for reasons the builders could not fix."	2	2		2																					
6081	6	"Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building were presented because dirigibles were to dock there. The first obstacle was safety because most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION3 were filled with hydrogen which is very flammable compared to helium. The builders were concerned because on May 6, 1937 the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, since it was filled by hydrogen, in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The second obstacle was nature: ""The winds... were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast"" (paragraph @NUM1). This meant that passengers could not get off safely and the dirigible could hit anything in the vicinity if swung a wrong way. The last obstacle was an existing law against airships fly too low over urban areas which means that it was illegal for a ship to tie up to a building or approach the area. Therefore, the builders of the Empire State Building who attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there were presented many obsticles as shown by the excerpt, The Mooring Mast."	3	3		3																					
6083	6	"Competitive architect Al Smith wanted the Empire State Building to be the tallest most unique building. ""Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling"" (@NUM1). The Building was supporting the age of transportation by dirigible. Al Smith commented ""It's on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now"" (@NUM2). In reality the architects were blind to the potential problems of the mast. There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One great reason was safety. If any dirigibles from outside the United States used to the mast it could be highly flammable due to using hydrogen rather helium. Another reason was nature itself. Shifting winds due to violent air currents made it dangerous as the back of the ship would twist around the mooring mast. Most importantly an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. That law would then make it illegal for a ship to ever tied to a building. By the late 1930s dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
6084	6	Based on the excerpt the builders faced many hard tasks The builders had to make sure that the mooring mast was stable enough to dock there. They also had to add on more floors on the Empire State building because the original Chrysler building added another 46 feet to still be the tallest building. Now the architects had to had the 85th floor plus the mooring mast, this brought the Empire State building to a total of 1,250 feet. The reason that a mooring mast failed was because the dirigible highly flamable and in a highly populated area like New York it would be tragic. Also nature itself with the wind were violent air current. This would cause the back of the dirigible to move around the mooring mast.	2	2		2																					
6086	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that dirigible use different gases to stay aloft. As stated in paragraph 6, The first obstacle the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building is ""To their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" From paragraph @NUM1 it states that if a mooring mast was to be droped to the roof of the building and a single cable tether would add stress to the building and pressure would cause them having to modify the building and framework, which cost over sixty thousand dollars. In other words most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Also from paragraph @NUM2 the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds would cause constantly shifting from air current. ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."	2	3		3																					
6089	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @ORGANIZATION2, the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", the first line says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. Strong winds due to violent air currents would make it impossible to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building. The wind would blow the dirigible off the mast into New York City. In paragraph @NUM2 under ""The Fate of the Mast"", a line states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law made it illegal for dirigibles and other aircraft to even fly in such and urban area like New York. One final obstacle is safety precautions. In paragraph @NUM3 a line states, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium."" If a dirigible were to crash and it had this highly flammable gas it would create a massive disaster. Violent winds, laws, and safety precautions are all against the docking of dirigibles at the mooring mast."	4	3		4																					
6090	6	When designing the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles, the builders came across a few obstacles. A dirigible is a blimp filled with hydrogen and/or helium to keep it lightly in the air. What the builders did not realize ahead of time was that hydrogen is a highly flammable gas. If it is docked on top of a building around movement it could easily catch on fire creating the whole building itself to blow up. Another obstacle that the builders noticed would occurred was the forceful winds. With a dirigible dock so high up in the air, it creates an unstable way for people to get off of it. The vicious winds would make the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast because only the front would be weighed down. The last obstacle that was found with docking a dirigible, was that it would be too low to an urban area. The dirigible would be too close to walking pedestrians, creating an un-safe enviroment if something was too go wrong. Without taking that chance, it was agreed that there were too many obstacles; therefore, the idea of docking a dirigible on top of the Empire State Building was cancelled.	3	3		3																					
6091	6	"In the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was having to make changes to the steel frame of the building in order to have the strength to ""accommodate the new situation. In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS2 that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"", @CAPS1 this was a costly project as well. The excerpt also @CAPS2 that there were problems with getting the dirigible to stay in place without moving. The dirigible would be in a very windy area, and there was only one chord attached to the building which would leave the back moving around all over the place."	3	2		3																					
6095	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the empire state building faced obstacles in attempting to allow Dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was when al Smith realized that he was close to Not winning the world's tallest building. It talks about it in paragraph @NUM1. Then he annonced that the building would reach 1,250 feet. That's an obstacle because without the building he cant make the dirigible, and he always wanted compitition so his building had to be the winning one and he had to build the dirigible."	0	0		0																					
6101	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced were nature and safety. Safety played a large role in the building of the Empire State Building. Two main safety conserns were getting passengers safely on and off dirigibles and the substances they were filled with. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" (paragraph @NUM1). The next obstacle the builders faced was nature. The wind speeds would shift due to violent air currents, causing the dirigibles to swivel around. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" (paragraph @NUM2). Due to nature and safety issues, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles allowing dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
6103	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. However, this task was not so easy. The builders of the Empire State Building could not just drop a mooring mast on its flat roof because they had to consider how the size of the dirigibles were affected. ""The architects could not simile drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also, it would be difficult to transmit the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure."" The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (paragraph @NUM1). The cost to improve the building's framework was also an obstacle. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (paragraph @NUM1)."	3	3		3																					
6104	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they had to make the Empire State Building taller. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor the for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow the passengers on or off the dirigible. The dirigibles were docked which meant that the electric winch, in which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless tower that would be illuminated from the inside. The roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Everything went as planned as the builders wanted tpo.	1	0		1																					
6105	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Such as there was a law preventing airships to fly too low over urban areas. Also they could not ancor down the back of the blimp, and due to the shifting winds that high it would not be safe for passangers to get on and off. The building also had to be rebuilt to be able to come close to staying stable with the dirigible attached. And last was the differences In gases used to keep the blimps afloat. most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen is highly flamable making in very unsafe. These are some of the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																					
6106	6	They faced challanges such as how to get the dirigibles to anchor on the building. There was really no safe way to do it. They also sayed the gas that keeps it floating is highly flamable. So it was like one big safty concern.In reality they ended up realizing its too dangerouse for them to do. If they took the chance and something went wrong innocent people could die.	2	1		2																					
6108	6	"The biggest obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. It was ""The winds on top of the building were contently shifting due to violent air currents."" Due to the wind currents dirigibles would not be able for to stay still to allow the passengers to get off of the dirigiblel. They once tryed this. ""In December 1930, the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible los Angeles approached the moorning mast but could not get close enouh to tie up bacase of forceful winds."" If the winds blue strong eneogh it could @CAPS1 the dirigible into a sharp object. After this atempd there was an; ""The building was an existing low against airships flying too low over urban areas."" ""It would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" @CAPS2 any dirigibles could never tie up the the building because of this new law. The biggest obstacle was the winds. The winds were because it's put tremondos stress on the building."	3	3		3																					
6111	6	Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a dock for dirigibles had many obstacles. There were obstacles like flamable gas in the dirigibles, dangerous to be near a densely populated area, the wind were constantly shifting due to air currents, and it would be dangling high above pedestrians. These obstacles were very difficult to solve.      In the dirigibles, there are filled with hydrogen, and hydrogen is highly flamable if the dirigibles caught on fire. It is also dangerous to be above a very densely populated area because if the dirigible ever failed, it would fall on inocent bystanders. It also is dangerous because the winds shift a lot, and it can get popped by other objects or buildings around the dirigible. Thus, why it is difficult to turn the mast into a loading dock for dirigibles.         Turning the mast on the Empire State Building into a loading dock for dirigibles is very difficult to do because it is not safe.	3	3		3																					
6115	6	"The builders and architects faced several different obstacles & dilemnas that intefered with the construction of the Empire State Building. One of them being the funds necessary in order to produce such a large structure. They found themselves constructing and reconstructing the frame of the structure time and time again, all in a feeble attempt to reach the desired perfection. Another obstacle occurred when their entire concept shattered by the fact that not every dirigible intended to land on the mast was fueled by helium. The text reads, ""Most digribles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This displays the severity of the idea, where risks like that just could not be taken, so they abandoned the idea of the mooring mast."	1	1		1																					
6118	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when having dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle for example was landing. New York lacked a suitable landing area for a dirigible. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. Also, safety was a problem. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire. The owners of the Empire State Building realized how the accident could've been worse, especially in New York. Even nature was an obstacle. Winds were constantly shifting on top of the building. So lead weights were used for the dirigible which wasn't safe, because they were dangling over pedestrians. There was a law that airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas.	3	2		3																					
6120	6	"Based on the article, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, including the overall structure of the building being affeted by stress from the dirigible, safety issues, and the impact of nature. To start off, the dirigible's weight plus the wind pressure around the building, caused too much stress to the building's frame. The steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the dirigible to be docked onto it. This modification and strengthening of the building process would call for an investment of over sixty thousand dollars. Next, the safety issue arose after being neglected before the building process began. Most dirigibles there were used outside of the United States contained hydrogen, which is a highly flammable gas, as opposed to using helium. This was a serious problem for a German dirigible named Hindenburg, when it was destroyed by fire in New Jersey in 1937. @ORGANIZATION2 writes ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). This was a major obstacle along with the wind factor. The winds at the top of the building were constantly shifting and no lead weights could be placed on the dirigible to stop it from shifting because it was a serious threat to pedestrians below. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles that prevented them from becoming a big landing spot for dirigibles."	4	4		4																					
6123	6	"The builders of the Empire State building face many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was overcoming the extra stress that a dock dirigible would add. In the excerpt The Mooring Mast author Marcia Amidon L�sted states ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation..."" Another obstacle the builders faced was the violent weather at the top of the building. L�sted says ""Even if the dirigibles was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and break the mooring mast."" This was a problem because it would make it unsafe for passengers to exit the dirigibles and walk down a gangplank connected to the Empire State building. The wind also made it difficult for a dirigible to navigate to the mooring mast without being blown into other buildings in the area. One of the greatest obstacles was making the mooring mast safe. L�nden states ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S use hydrogn rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigibles were to catch fire over a heavily populated area like New York the casualties would be numerous. These were some of the many obstacles builders faced when attempting to construct a mooring mast on the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
6125	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many promblems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most of there problem they encountered when designing the mast. They found that they could not just drop a mooring mast on top of the building at a thousand feet. The building was not strong enough, so they had to strengthen the building with a new steel frame. Then the builders also faced safety issues. At a thousand feet the air currents were extremely violant. By the end of the construction it was quickly noticed that dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building.	3	2		3																					
6126	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that prevented dirigibles from landing there. It was too dangerous to tether dirigibles to the mast of the building for four main reasons. The first was that a dirigible moored to the mast of the building ""would add stress to the building's frame"". This problem was soon solved, however, as the steel frame was changed and it became strong enough to endure the added stress. Another reason that dirigibles could not be attached to the Empire State building is that dirigibles are highly flammable when they use hydrogen gas. It became apparent that if a dirigible were to catch fire in downtown New York it would be too terrible to risk. Dirigibles also couldn't be attached to the mast because the winds on top of the building would cause the back of the ship to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" and this would not be safe. Finally, dirigibles could not be moored to the Empire State building because ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area [could] puncture the dirigible's shell"". The dirigibles could not fly so low without posing a risk to the people. Dirigibles could not land at the Empire State Building because there were too many dangers."	3	4		4																					
6127	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced constructing a correct mooring mast for the zepplins, and concerning the safety of the people in the city. They also had to account for the weather and how it may have affected the blimps.      The builders had to add on more floors to the building and strengthen it's base so that the mast could work properly and stay stable. then they ruled out using weights to anchor the blimps in place because the people on the street below. Also the chemicals in the blimp were highly flamable and put people around at risk. Sometimes the winds were too strong for the blimps to get close enough without being punctured. The builders were faced with impossible obstacles to overcome	3	3		3																					
6129	6	"The obstacles the builders of the empire State Building faced, was the lack of a suitable landing area. They will ""allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refuel, or service, and to let passengers off and on"". Also ""Dirigibles were docked by which means of an winch, @CAPS1 thats what they did and faced to dock there."	1	0		1																					
6130	6	"In the @ORGANIZATION1 there where many problems that where faced durring the build. The Way that this all @CAPS1 was when the archetect Al Smith wanted to make a building like no other, A building that was taller than the new chrysler building and one that was futureistic. The first problem that they ran into was, what was a building of this size going to be used for? There where many differen't ideas but the one that came to Al @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was transportation. This building could be used for a new kind of transportation where people could board a Dirigible ""also known as a blimp"" at the very top of the building. the next problem was if this would be safe to do because they couldn't have a big problem in the middle of New York. The idea went to Washington to be reviewed and ended up not being safe enough. Al Smith didn't care, His building was the tallest."	0	1		1																					
6132	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles were fueled by hydrogen, which was highly flammable. This danger was shown by the Hindenburg disaster in New Jersey, and the owners of the building did not want to face a similar accident in a place as densely populated as New York. Another obstacle that arose was the fact that the violent wind at such an altitude would toss the back of the ship back and forth. This would not only be a technical hassle as it would also make it nearly impossible to get passengers in and out of the dirigible, and make it a frightening experience for anyone inside the ship as well. In addition, the ships could not be weighed down with lead weights as it would be too risky to have them dangling high above pedestrians. A final implication was that if dirigibles moored at the Empire State building, it would violate an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Because of this, docking a ship there would be illegal which obviously way not helpful to the project. In the end, these obstacles were the key reasons that the endeavor failed. 	4	4		4																					
6135	6	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, she talked about the obstacles facest when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. The three main obstacles was the safety, mother nature and existing laws. One of the greatest obstacle was because of safety. L�sted states, ""... Never fulfilled its purpose... The greatest reason was one safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Because hydrogen is highly flammable there would be no way that would be safe. The building could catch of fire and be a danger for all. Secondly, nature itself would have an affect on the dirigibles. L�sted states, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The violent air currents couldnt allow dirigibles to be on the Empire State Building because you can't have dirigibles with violent air currents. It isnt safe. Lastly, laws was an obstacle the builders had to face: L�sted's knowledge is, ""The other practical lesson why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The law was a huge obstacle for the builders building the dirigibles. Because you can't build something with it being against the law. Because of safety, mother nature and laws, thats what stop the builders from building the dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
6139	6	"The builders faced many obstacles while trying to add a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. As stated in paragraph fourteen, nature was the biggest obstacle the builders faced. The ""violent air currents"" would cause dirigibles to move around the mooring mast, even if it was tethered. Another obstacle faced, was that the architects couldn't just add a mooring mast to the top of the building; over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building's framework. Lastly, as stated in paragraph thirteen, most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, even though it was flammable. When the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went up in flames, the owners of the building realized the dangers of this."	4	3		4																					
6140	6	The buiders faced many obstacles. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat surface it took alot of stress and hard work. The dirigible was held by a single cable tether and the dirigible was about a thousand feet. That made the builders very stressed and made them think clearly and carefully about the wind pressure and also the dirigibles load.	1	2		2																					
6144	6	In @DATE1, the Empire State Building was constructed and would be used to house a new form of travel. The mooring mast, constructed at the top of the building would be used to dock one-thousand foot dirigibles; the future of travel. In theory, the blimp would be docked at the mast, using an electric winch, but in reality, there was no safe way of doing so at such a high altitude. Another challenge faced was the highly flammable gas, hydrogen, which was used. One lit match could send the steel frame plummeting to the earth below. The soft fabric which covered the steel frame could easily be punctured, which was unsuitable for an urban area.The men constructing the blimp either looked over, or forgot the elements of nature which restricted this project. At the peak of the building, winds reached high velocities, and shifted directions rapidly which would have rapped the dirigible around the mast. The greatest obstacle was the law, restricting airships from flying too low over New York's growing urban civilization. In the Empire State Building's history, one blimp has attempted to simulated dock, and another has performed a newspaper stunt. Any man his right mind would see that this project was doomed before it had begun.	3	3		3																					
6145	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They consulted with experts, taking tours equipment and mooring operations in New Jersey.The architects couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building, if it did it would add stress to the building's frame. The Stress of the load and would have been transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened.The greatest obstacle  was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly Shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would around and around the mooring mast. You could weigh it down but that would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, which was neither practical or safe.There was also a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. And When they tried delivering newspapers they noticed it wasn't going to work	3	3		3																					
6146	6	The builders had to face alot. They had to rebuild the whole top again so the dirigibles could dock there. Architects couldent just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State. A Dirigible on top of a building held by a single cable tether would add alot of stress to the buildings frame. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be upgraded and strengthened. Also all of these modifications would cost over sixty thousand dollars to make the buildings framework better.	2	1		2																					
6147	6	To have a building built Over @NUM1 ft. tall and expect dirigibles/blimbs be able to dock there is dangerous and has many obstacles around it. First, the weather is not always nice. If you have a windy day the blimb is going to sway back and forth over thousands of pedestrians in New York. Putting lead blocks in the back would be very dangerous. you have lead in the back swaying with thousands of people underneath you. Secondly, most blimbs outside of the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammabe, and could destroy a whole building if the fire spread... Finally, blimbs could not moor at the Empire State building if it is against the law for an airship to hover to low to urban areas. Those are many reasons why blimps could not moor at the Empire State building.	3	3		3																					
6150	6	"There are many obstacles that the builders faced in order to allow dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building. One obstacle was safety. Foreign countries used highly flammable gases to fill their dirigibles with. According to the passage ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Another obstacle was whether. The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. For example, U.S. Navy dirigible, Los Angeles couldn't tie up to the mast because of the wind, which might have resulted in a puncture in the shell of the dirigible. One more obstacle was the law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. According to the passage ""This law would make it illegal to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area""... Because of the many obstacles that the builders faced, the Empire State building was unable to fulfill its original purpose, but is still considered a worldwide landmark today."	3	4		4

One obstacle was that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" This is a very important obstacle because of the frame becomes to stressed by excess wait of the dirigible the building might collapse. another obstacle is wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This is also a major obtacle because the dirigibles were very light lighter than air so the violent winds would swing it arond that high in the air is not a safe thing especially considering that downtown @CAPS1 is below were there are thousands of people. And a third obstacle was the Law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal to fly that low, to be able to tie the blimp up to the building."	3	3		3																					
6158	6	What the builders are faced with while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, one of them was nature. The winds at the top of the building were always shifting cause of violent air currents. Even if they were able to tie the front of the dirigibles to the building the cable that is holding it will cause pressure to the building. They only way you could have the building not have pressure on it was to modify the building so it can get stronger that would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Even if they were able to get around all these obstacles there is a law against airships flying to low over the city. So either way it would not have been able to happen.	3	3		3																					
6159	6	A dirigible is not like a plane or a hot air balloon, it is filled with flamable gases, and to try to dock something that big on top of the worlds tallest building would be extremely dangerous too the urban town below and extremely dangerous for the workers.	1	1		1																					
6162	6	The problems That The empire state building faced was alot of things for one example it was Never @CAPS1 out clearly because They didn't know about The law That aircrafts could Not come @CAPS2 any suburb areas and They really saw what could of happened when The hindenburg burned to the ground. Anthor great obstacles They faced was Nature becuse The winds on top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents and This would cause The dirigble To swivel around the mooring mast. one last obstacle That was faced was The structure of the dirigble becuse if it kept on landing on Top of The building it would keep on destroying The building's sturcture.

With all of these obstacles it would not only be improbable, but close to impossible to dock dirigibles on the mast of the Empire State Building."	3	4		4																					
6166	6	When Al Smith wanted to make a dock on the Empire State Building he wasnt really thinking straight. That was a horrible idea. Passengers would risk their lifes going on and off the dirigibles. He probably wasnt thinking about safety things and just was going for looks. The obstacles he would encounter words death from idiots that would go up there, weather, and @CAPS1. The weather was a huge factor because if it were to be windy it could through the dirigibles to go off course and crash. The @CAPS1 to make this landing pad would be crazy too because they would have to buy all the floats and make a landing station. @ORGANIZATION2 wasnt in a smart guy for letting dirigibles for landing.	2	1		2																					
6167	6	"The biggest and most obvious obstacles of attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were the factors of safety, nature and the city's law concerning low-flying airships. According to the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 the greatest safety risk was that most blimps made/operated outside the U.S ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) @CAPS1 a hydrogen filled dirigible to float above densely populated @ORGANIZATION2 would have been to dangerous of a risk. In 1937 a hydrogen blimp did catch fire, and the outcome was disastrous; owners of the Empire State knew another accident like that above New York would have been much worse. In higher altitudes winds increase, and the winds atop the Empire State would cause the blimp's tail end to spend about. Normally the tail end would be weighted down, but weights hanging above the city isn't safe either. During one of the two failed attempt: at docking of the building the winds were too fierce for the dirigible to even get close to the building. The capitan of the blimp feared ""... that the wind would blow with the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area..."" (paragraph @NUM2) and that could put a hole in the blimp. Lastly, a law in New York City states that airships can't fly below a specific altitude, thus making the docking of a dirigible on top of the Empire State illegal. Many apparent obstacles were over looked in the planning of the Empire State Building's blimp dock."	4	4		4																					
6169	6	The obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is the winds on top on the building were always shifting because of the violent air currents. Also the dirigibles use Hydrogen, which is highly flammable. So if it blows up, there gonna be a lot of bad things going on in New york. Also there was a law against airships flying too low over Urban areas. The building would have to be modified and strengthened before the dirigibles could go there.	3	2		3																					
6171	6	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the architects faced many obstacles. Usually, when given an obstacle, you either succeed it or fail it. In this case, these men didn't overcome the obstacle.In the reading, it mentioned that dirigibles from outside the U. S. contained hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and it could cause a lot of damage. Not only to the building itself, but the area of downtown New York as well. Winds at the top of the building were shifting due to air currents. This could cause the dirigibles to circle the mast when even tied down. The architects also had to think about the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The builders didn't realize how complicated the process of even tying down a dirigible would be because of the high winds. Even the process of dropping off newspapers was difficult, and took up too much time. Who would want in enormous steel framed balloons dangling over them anyways?	4	3		4																					
6176	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem was the structure of the building, after the mast was designed they needed a building that could withstand the stress of the mast. ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornametation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower. They were able to overcome that obstacle. Another obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"" @CAPS1 obstacles did that bring? Well, hydrogen is highly flammable. When a German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey, the owners of the ""Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area. The obstable brought upon another obstacle of practicality. Dirigibles customarily landed in open fields. ""The greatest obstacle to successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building made it unsafe the only solution would be tethering the dirigible and weighing down the back with lead weights but using these at the building ""dangling high over pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"". Architects faced many obstacles."	4	3		4																					
6180	6	There were three main reasons as to why the Empire State Building would not serve well as a mooring mast for the dirigibles. For one, it was unsafe. Most of dirigibles were filled with highly flammable hydrogen and the fear of a Hindenburg repeat was to great. Especially over a highly populated city. Two, violent air currents were present in and around New York City. Docking a dirigible would be too difficult and if it were docked, the wind would make it unsafe. Lastly, a law was passed that made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This made it impossible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. These three obstacles were all contributing factors as to why the Empire State Building could not serve as a dirigible mooring mast.	3	4		4																					
6182	6	"When builders attempted building a structure to allow dirigibles, or blimps, to dock on the Empire State Building in New York, they did not realize how many problems they would encounter. Upon designing the mast on top of the building, designers realized that if a dirigible was docked on to the building, it would add stress to the frame, and therefore, would have to modify the Empire State building's structure. To do this, sixty thousand dollars was needed, as well as more hours of labor. Another obstacle encountered was the fact that nature got in the way, and ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (line @NUM1). It would be difficult to dock it to the building, because the dirigible would be constantly swaying due to wind, and passengers could not get on the blimp. Furthermore, blimps usually were moored in open fields, with the aid of lead weights to help weigh them down. If lead weights were introduced in New York City, where it was very populated, they could potentially fall while dangling in the air, endangering pedestrians. In conclusion, builders faced many obstacles while trying to achieve docking capability for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
6183	6	"There were many obstacles that the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced one of them were redesigning some parts of the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 job was to create the mast for docking new airships called dirigible or blimps. This plan came with great difficulty, they couldn't drop on mooring mass on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. They came to figure out that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). This stress would have to be transmitted to the buildings foundation.     The @CAPS1 had to modified and strengthened the steelframe in order to accommodate the situation of the stress on the building frame Also creating the rocket shaped mass the @CAPS1 had to work on many different parts. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. This had to be done presisely in order for everything towork     This were the obstacles the @CAPS1 face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock in the Empire State building."	2	2		2																					
6184	6	The main problem they had with the docking of the dirigibles was it would have to be really safe. To hold the aircraft down they would have to use lead weights. I weights fell from the top of the building in such a dense, populated area it would be very dangerous. Also when the owners of the Empire State got notice of the hindenburg blowing up they felt uneasy. Even if the aircraft was floating moored to the top of the building the wind would whip it around making it even more unsafe. The idea was good but not probable to be safe.	2	2		2																					
6185	6	When building the Empire State Building, there was obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame. So the architects have to motify it and stregthen the building. Spending over sixty thousand dollars on the new motification. The building will turn from @NUM1 floors to 102. From there dirigible passenger will board from there. In conclusion when building the Empire State Building there was obstacles faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	2	2		2																					
6186	6	"There were many issues that made it impossible to use the Mast of the Empire State Building as a dock for dirigibles. One was that many foreign dirigibles were filled with hydrogen a very flammable gas. If one caught fire like the Hindenburg, it would cause many trageties because it would be above people's homes. For the same reason, there was  a law against dirigibles flying too low over cities.""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.""@CAPS1 the safety risks for people below, there was the wind causing a problem that the blimp could not even dock correctly. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around."" One of the attempts proved that it would be tricky to land. The Los Angeles attempted to reach the building, but retired the thought because of the wind. The captain feared he could fly into one of the spires of a tall building and the dirigible could be punctured. ""[He] could not even take his hands off the control lever."""	3	3		3																					
6187	6	In the article The Mooring Mast by @PERSON1 @CAPS1, she describes the difficulties of designing the Mast for Dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building. Al Smith the mayor of New York City at the time of construction of the Empire State building came up with the idea to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. He wanted to make New York city a technologically advanced city. After the mast was proposed desingners discovered problems with mast being installed. They discovered that they would have to modify the steel frame because if a thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would transimite stress all the way down the frame to the foundation. due to the load and wind pressure. The wind speeds on the top of the building would blow the dirigible around in the wind, this is very unsafe being close to a building.	2	2		2																					
6189	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faceD many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When designing the mast, they didn't realize that the mast ""would add stress to the building's frame"" and in order to fix this problem, they would have to pay ""over sixty thousand Dollars' worth"" for modifications for the building's framework.      Another problem they encountereD, besides the fact that there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" ""the winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting."" This did not allow dirigibles to be able to get close enough to dock, in fear that the ""wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" which would damage the dirigible's shell.      An alternate problems faceD by builders was realized when the Hindenburg was destroyeD in New Jersey, due to the fact that ""hydrogen is extremely flammable."" They realized how unsafe it be to have an accident like that ""above a densely populateD area."" AnD so, builders were forceD to stop their work."	4	3		4																					
6190	6	The builders of the empire State Building faced many problems atempting to dock dirigibles. Most of these problems were safety concerns. One issue was the use of hydrogen, which is highly flamable and explosive gas. A fire acident would be catastrophic, since down town newyork is densely populated. Another problem was that the tail of the dirigible could not be weighted down as it usualy is, because then thered be massive weighs dangling over the streets. With the winds blowing and the blimp not securely tethered, and not weighted, Dirigibles would have swayed and moved around. That creates the risk of the blimp getting punctured by sharp edges on other buildings. Also if the blimp ever successfully moored it would create tremendous stress on the building. Besides the technical issues there were some obvious obstacles that oddly never got considered or addressed. The first being a law prohibiting low-altitude flights of airships over urban centers. That makes it illegal to even attempt to land, meaning there was never any remote chance of the mooring mast functioning. The second promblem was, the proper mooring equipment were never installed. That meant no attempt could ever succeed. The builders faced many obstacles building the mast but they're biggest obstacle was lack of preparation, failure to address obvious problems.	4	3		3																					
6191	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced two obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was the forceful winds. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even tethering the dirigible to the mooring mast would cause the back of the ship to swivel dangerously around the mooring mast. The second obstacle was due to an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area.	2	3		3																					
6194	6	Upon taking up the task of building a mast for dirigibles to dock at, the architects encountered many obstacles which made the idea of a mooring mast unplausable. One obstacle they ran into was the violent nature of the wind currents above the city. If the dirigibles were to dock at the building with a tether, then the back would be free to swing and sway. Another factor they had to consider is that dirigibles are full of the flamable gas hydrogen which imposed the risk of a serious fire hazzard about New York City. Even if the engineers and architects managed to work out all of the kinks of building the mast, they still would face another obstacle. It was illegal to fly dirigibles to low over urban areas. These are the reasons why the idea of a dock for dirigibles could never work out.	3	3		3																					
6195	6	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. By allowing the dirigibles to dock there, They had to build @CAPS2 planfronts on the side of the building, which means that they would be putting there life's in danger. They also had to deal with the electrical  problems within and without the building. The @CAPS1 on the outsides of the building would have to deal with the strong wind currents. They also have to make sure that the electrical system was working properly. If there were to be a stark of any sort of Fire, the hydrogen and helium were extremely flameable, and if a wire were too short, it could like the whole dirigible aflame and it would blow up.	1	2		2																					
6197	6	"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the obstacles were safty factors and nature its self.Safty was a big obstacle in this plan for a morning mast because the dirigibles use hydrogen to float these big ships. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the owners of the Empire State Building relized how bad it would be if the dirigibles were to cech of fire over a highly populated city like New York. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, May 6, 1937, the owners relized how much worse that accident could have been in New York.""The greatest obstacle was nature. Humans couldn't control wind and ontop of the building they were constantly changeing makeing it hard to dock. ""The winds ontop of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The mooring mast couldn't be done."	3	3		3																					
6201	6	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" The excerpt went through @CAPS1 obstacles Such as @CAPS2. If the men were not trying to compete the buildings would probably have been okay. If you take your time and real try to reach your goal you can."	0	0		0																					
6206	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in allowing dirigibles to dock there are many, mainly it is a safety concern. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", stated the article. ""They would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical nor safe."" This shows the dirigibles are inpractable and a danger to both the people in it and the people on the street below."	1	2		1																					
6207	6	The greatest obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey on May 6, 1937 the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over your ring areas. The wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers.	2	3		3																					
6210	6	"In this excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there were many obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced, in attempting dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced, was that they lacked a suitable landing area. Because of this, they came up with the idea of having the passengers get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. Another obstacle they faced, was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another main obstacle that the builders faced was that ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" In the end, the idea of the mooring mast, was a failure. The builders didnt think about potential problems that could occur. For example, nature itself, the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, and even fires, due to the gas (hydrogen) used in some dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
6211	6	If the Empire State Building were to dock dirigibles, there would be many problems in the way. They had a lack of landing area for an almost one-thousand foot blimp. This dirigible being held by a single tether to the Empire State Building would put a large amount of stress on the building's structure risking a possible collapse if continued. If they were to use the Empire State Building, They would have to modifiy it and use thousands of dollars in the process. Even then if the dirigible held onto the Building, the back of the blimp would sway with the high winds and that might risk the safety of the passengers. All in all the idea of landing a dirigible on a gigantic building is just a bad idea	3	3		3																					
6212	6	Dirigible docking would have been a great addition to the Empire State Building. There were many obsticles the architects had to go through to complete this goal. The building wasn't strong enough. If they had tied a dirigible to the top of the original Empire state bilding, it would have pulled the building untill it feel over. The architects had to upgrade the frame so it was safe. Now that the frame was safe they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast the other end would blow in the wind. This would make unloding cargo and people very hard. Also dirigibles could catch fire, which wasn't safe. for the people on the ground. In the and it just wasn't safe to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building.	2	3		3																					
6215	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first big obstacle was designing the mast. Architects couldn't just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building; it had a flat roof. If a dirigible was moored it would add additional stress to the frame, and wind pressure would be a factor as well. The mooring mast was never destined to fulfill the purpose of landing dirigibles, because it isn't safe, nature (dirigible with swivel in back) it could possibly be weighed down by lead in back but that cant be hung above pedestrians on the street. A practical reason why they could not moor was a particular law already in place against air ships flying to low. Although, this had happened two dirigibles had attempted to moor there the first turned back due to bad weather conditions and the second one was as a publicity stunt had dropped off newspapers before the landing gear could be installed so they had to use a wire to recieve them. In result the idea was shelved.	3	3		3																					
6218	6	Well the dirigibles were airships flying to low over the city and over urban areas. Also the U.S @ORGANIZATION2 approached the mooring mast to tie up but the winds were to forceful. also a Goodyear Blimp Columbia. Attempted a publicity stunt where it tied up and deliver a bundle of newspapers.	1	1		1																					
6222	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was trying to moor a dirigible at the top without stressing the building too much. It says, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means they planned to deal with this problem by spreading this stress all the way to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle that was faced was trying to keep the dirigibles from moving and swaying too much, once they were moored. It says, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It was impossible to keep the dirigibles from moving because the wind was so violent. The last problem was that even if they could get a dirigible to moor to the building, it was illegal to fly the airships that low in an urban area. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" In conclusion, all of these obstacles that the builders faced led to the final result of being unsuccessful."	4	3		4																					
6223	6	The Empire State Building faced alot promblems before it came out as an @ORGANIZATION1.  They scared that other people will destroy this Building.  So the reduced the dirigibles to dock there. They wanted their city to become a famous city and get more money. And other problem the some people didn't care and postpone to later.	0	0		0																					
6226	6	"In building the empire state building, the builders faced many obstacles in the process of letting dirigibles moor at the mooring mast. In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the author gives us examples as to what was difficult. One obstacle in the docking of dirigibles to the mast was safety for the people inside. The article says, ""The greatest reason was one of safety."" It then goes on to say ""Most dirigibles from out of the U.S used Hydrogen, Hydrogen is highly flammable."" another reason was nature. The author states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would lead to unscure departure of passengers. The article also says ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel"" which shows unsafe air conditions.

If there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York, more than just the passengers would be harmed. Another obstacle was that there was a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to even go near the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
6228	6	Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems such as to much wind movement, to much weight, and to many safty risks. when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there.The wind movement would move the dirigibles around when trying to dock so they would have troubles with that. They would also have weight problems because they didn't have a stable enough frame around the building. They would have to pay alot of money to fix this problem.The last problem was a safety problem. After the German dirigible Hindenburg blew up they realized that it was way to dangerous to have blimps landing over crowded cities It was also a flying law of airships not being able to go that low over a city.This is why the builders had faced so many problems.	3	3		3																					
6229	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State building faced the obstacles of the use of hydrogen in dirigibles in which is highly flammable, nature itself, and an existing law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.It stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt, most dirigibles outside the united state used hydrogen, which is very flammable. Realizing that this kind of happening above an outrageously populated area such as New York City would be extremely dangerous. To explicate.

The author also states that in order for the invention to work out, the Empire State building's steel frame would have to have more strength to it and it would have to be modified to accommodate the new idea.

""A thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame... The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This quote from the excerpt cleary shows that the builders would have to move around this to complete their job, which would entirely make this situation an obstacle. Another obstacle faced by the workers was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This quote shows another obstacle because builders could not find a practical way to get the passengers off, and putting lead in the back would only endanger the pedestrians below. The final obstacle the builders faced was the safety of everyone. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This quote shows a very big obstacle, which actually happened to the German dirigible Hindenburg. Those were the obstacles that were faced by the workers during the time of attempting to dock dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
6245	6	Many obstacles occured for the builers of the Empire State building and allowing dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles was the mooring mast itself. The winds on top of the Empire State Building were constantly shifting and if the dirigible was tied to the mooring mass it would swivel around the mooring mast. Another obstacle the builders experienced during this process was the already existing law not allowing airships to fly too low over urban areas. Due to the fact that the Empire State building was in New York, an urban area, the dirigable idea would have most likely never worked. The dirigable was unable to fulfill its destiny and the obstacles the builders faced were the main reasons.	3	3		3																					
6252	6	Builders had many obstacles to overcome when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing area. This obstacle did not stop Al Smith, he saw this as an oppertunity to add a mooring mast at the top of the building so dirigibles could anchor there. This idea caused another obstacle, a mooring mast could not possibley be dropped on top of the roof of the building. The stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. With this the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened costing @MONEY1 just to change the framework. In the end this mooring mast to dock dirigibles never came through and archetects should have seen the potential problems in the beginning.	2	3		3																					
6254	6	"The builders of the Empire State building, who wished to place a mooring mast at the top of the building, faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. One such obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles at the time used highly flammable hydrogen, and should a single spark enter the balloon, the entire dirigible would catch fire. Eventually, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how [harmful an] accident could [be] if it [took] place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" and halted construction of the mooring mast. Another obstacle was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" A third reason was that, even should there be some way of holding the dirigible still against all that air pressure, all the stress of holding that dirigible still ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" All these problems contributed to the mooring mast's fate disuse."	3	3		3																					
6255	6	"The first main obsticale that the builders faced was the fact that blimps even though they have propellers and rudders are still at the mercy of the wind. And since the wind on top of the building was described as ""Constantly shifting due to violen air currents"" (� @NUM1) it would be impossible to keep the blimps stable while it was moored on the Empire state building. Just docking the blimp onto the building was an impossible feet, the only blimp that even tried to dock onto the Empire state building, the naval dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the building to get the mooring lines on because they where ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of the othe building in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" (� @NUM2) causing the dirigible to fall onto the city.The second main obsticale was the public safety aspect of trying to moore a dirigible on the Empire State building There were too many things that could go wrong. The blimp could explode like the Hindenburg, or could run into one of the spires on the surrounding buildings and plumet to the ground potentially killing or severely injuring hundreds of people. That is why trying to dock a dirigible on the Empire State building was an impractical idea."	4	4		4																					
6257	6	"The worker faced many obsticals while building the Empire State Building. Sence Al Smith was trying to compete with the Chrysler Building for the tallest building he kept adding on to the Empire State Building. To make his building the tallest in the world he added the mooring mast. This mast would make the Empire State building 1,250 feet tall. The builders had to redesine the entier buildings sceleton. They had to make sure the Empire State Building could hold up the mast. The mast was made so that Dirigibles could land thire and people could get on and off it. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened."" The builders fixed the steel fram of the building with in two months. The building went on as planned. After awhile the people begin to see that the mas couldn't be used for dirigibles because of the violent wind currents at the top of the building."	2	2		2																					
6258	6	"When builders were building the Empire State Building they came across many obstacles. One problem was lack of suitable landing area in @CAPS1 (paragraph 6). Al Smith came up with the idea to put a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to land there, but there was many problems with this mooring mast. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" (paragraph @NUM1) architects had to strengthen the building's foundation. Over sixty thousand dollars was spent to try and modify the buildings framework. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" (paragraph @NUM2) The winds were shifting and the back of the ship would swivel around, which was not safe. Another reason is that airships flew too low over urban areas. Having a mooring mast for dirigibles to land was dangerous, going against some laws, and a lot of work."	4	4		4																					
6260	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem they faced was that the dirigibles moored to the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame, so the stress of the dirigibles load would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation. Another problem they faced was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen so it would be very bad if one was destroyed by fire above densely populated downtown New York. Also there was already a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to even approach the area.	3	2		2																					
6262	6	"In the beginning, all the plans made for the Empire State Building seemed perfectly plausible. Dirigibles would tie up to the mast on top of the building and dock there while the passengers got off; easier said then done. Soon enough they began to realize all the flaws in this plan, there were @NUM1 main @NUM2.) After seeing how easily the ""Hindenburg was destroyed by fire"" they realize it was too dangerous having dirigibles fly over such a ""densely populated area such as downtown New @NUM3.) When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock, it ""could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" It was far to windy for the light dirigibles to stay in @NUM4.) @CAPS1 with the wind problem, if somehow a dirigible was able to be tied down ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. ""@CAPS2, unlike dirigible landing fields it was far too risky to dangle weights above the city of @CAPS3 just to hold the back of the dirigibles down.@NUM1.) Unlike previously thought, dirigibles were not the way of the future, airplanes became the newer more efficient way in the late 1930's.A good idea, but as they said: ""destined to never fulfill its purpose."""	3	3		3																					
6263	6	The @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the law. There was a law in place preventing airships flying too low over urban cities. This made it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. Another isue they had was that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, not helium Hydrogen is extremely flammable and it would be catastrophic if a dirigible blew up over New York City. The last problem they @ORGANIZATION1 was the wind. At the top of the building the winds shifted due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tied up the back end would move around. They got the idea to use lead weights on the back but it would not be safe over all those people.	3	3		3																					
6264	6	The builders of the Empire State building had a grand idea of including a mooring mast where dirigibles, also known as zeppelins or blimps, could dock themselves. Though the idea was good, it provided the builders with many obstacles. For example, when the framework was being built, the mast was going to have to be added to the top. The mast couldn't just be dropped on, however because if a dirigibles were to the moored there, it would put too much stress on the building's framework. This revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger which was very expensive.Another difficulty the builder's faced, after construction was completed, in allowing dirigibles to dock there was nature. The building was 1,250 feet tall, so the winds up at the top were constantly changing and dangerous, making it difficult for the dirigible remain stationary when moored. Also, something the builders didn't foresee was the laws against blimps flying to low over urban areas. These two challenges ended up making the use of the mooring mast impossible	3	3		3																					
6265	6	One obstacle that the builders faced was that havin dirigibles hanging over a heavy populated area was extremely dangerous, because May 6, 1937 the german's dirigible was destroyed by fire, another obstacle was that it was illegal to have blimps flying to low over heavy populaded areas. So Al Smith had to let go of that plan.	2	2		2																					
6269	6	"The main problem the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to let dirigibles to dock were the wind conditions and how close dirigibles were to the building. The wind conditions made it hard for the builders to figure out how dirigibles would dock there. The winds near the top of the building were, ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The other problem the builders faced was how close dirigibles came to the building. In one case, as a test run, the Los Angeles tried to approach the mast but it, ""could not get close enough to tie up..."". Even though the building was not what it was suppose to be it is still one of the greatest of all time."	3	3		3																					
6271	6	Throughout the excerpt, on trying to build the empire state building; the builders faced a lot of hard attempts trying to build the dock for the dirigibles. One major problem is that the dirigible was not able to land on the buildings flat roof. This was stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt. Another problem is that they had to design elevators and stairs for the passengers to travel to the top of the building to be able to get on the dirigible. Along with designing stairs they had to be able to build 102 floors just for the area where the blimp would land. This can be supported in paragraph 11 and @NUM2 of the reading. After trying to build the big building, the builders ran into major safety concers towards the end of the making. The builders did not think they would run into any problems or think of the safety.	1	1		1																					
6278	6	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building faced the @CAPS2 of purfictle placing a thousand foot dirigible on top of the Building which would of not worket out Because of the wind and there was no wait in the back that would of kept the dirigible in place in which now ment that the dirigible would have been swinging back and fort and gave the riesct of the dirigible poking a sharp point on the corner of the Empire State Building and exploding, the dirigible above New York City and putting thousand of life at dinger. The @CAPS1 also faced the @CAPS2 of getting to micheenery that was needed to @CAPS4 the mooring mast. Another obstacle @CAPS1 had to face was getting aprover do to safety hasits because what had happing to the hindenburg in lakehurst, New Jersey.	3	3		3																					
6279	6	The builders faced many obstacles in building a moor to dock dirigibles. It was unsafe for a dirigible to be so close to the ground, especially in New York. The air currents from high above made the machine harder to operate near buildings. Another factor that contributed to the danger was that dirigibles are highly flammable due to the hydrogen which made most of them stay afloat then. Many blimps attempted to dock at the Empire State building, none of which were successful.	2	2		2																					
6281	6	"Architects designing the Empire State Building with the intent of docking zeppelins to it at heights of over @NUM1 feet no doubt had a lot to go through. According to ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, obstacles included adding stress to the buildings frame with a blimp attached, and the design of the mooring mast itself. The article says that ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" in order to make docking safe. The mooring mast was composed mostly of steel. Other problems facing architects was the wind factor, and keeping zeppelins immobile in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at @NUM2 feet. Safety hazards also came into account, because architects realized that should another accident like the Hindenburg's occur again in New York City, results could be disastrous. As such, the Empire State Building's mooring mast for zeppelins never went into operation."	3	3		3																					
6282	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" various obstacles were faced in the challenge of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State Building's mooring mast. The first challenge the builders faced was that of nature. ""The greatest obstacle ...was nature itself."" (@NUM1) The violent winds that high up would cause the dirigible to swing unpredictably, making it unsafe. Another problem arose when the ""Hindenburg"" caught fire in New Jersey. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@NUM2) If a hydrogen-filled dirigible would catch fire while at the Empire State Building, it could be very dangerous for both the building and the pedestrians below. The last obstacle was a law. ""...existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@NUM3) This law made it illegal for any aircraft to fly even remotely close to the Empire State Building. In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building."	3	4		4																					
6285	6	"Although the plans for the mooring mast were optimistic, there were many obstacles that kept that plan from becoming a reality. The first  reason why builders difficulty allowing dirigibles to dock was because of safety. The helium that filled the balloons was highly flammable. If one were to catch fire, it would be a danger to all of New York City. Secondly, the high winds made it unsafe for the dirigibles. Paragraph @NUM1 states, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around..."". Lastly, the builders faced the obstacle of pre- existing laws when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the mooring mast. An existing law stated that aircraft couldn't fly too low over urban areas. These three main obstacles were face by the builders of the Empire State Building. The mooring mast never became a reality because of these obstacles."	3	3		3																					
6287	6	"The obstacles builders faced were weather, hight of the structure, stability of the structure, and worriying about the highly flamable gases from the dirigible. The weather affected having the dirigible dock there because the winds could whip it around, knocking it into nearby buildings. The structure needs to be stable at it's hight so the dirigible doesn't knock over the empire state building. The author Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 states, ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation,"" this was nessisary so the dirigible wouldn't knock over the Empire State Building, wiping out a lot of New York. The highly flammable gases would need to be under intense supervision, because if they caught of fire the Empire State Building and pedestrians, and downtown New York would catch of fire. These reasons are the obstacles they faced and why a mooring mast was never completed and used."	3	3		3																					
6288	6	"One of the big problems facing docking dirigibles is the government and the law. It is illegal to have such a low-flying aircraft. It says, ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle would be safety. Dirigibles are FLAMMABLE and could easily injure and kill people if an accident happened. Is to dangerous, ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS2. @NUM2) Another problem is nature and weather. The winds up there are extremely high and powerful. A big danger to dirigibles, ""... violent air currents... back of the ship would swivel around... high above pedestrians,"" (@CAPS2. @NUM3)."	4	3		4																					
6289	6	"@ORGANIZATION3 writes in her excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to create a dock for dirigibles. In late 1929 Al Smith was confident of the height and use the building would achieve. Those working on the project of the mooring mast consulted with experts from the U.S. Naval Air Station but eventually found the project too much to handle.The mast never fulfilled its intended use due to the numerous issues they faced, the main one of which being nature itself. Docking a dirigible at the high altitude of the building's peak through proved practically impossible. The danger of the project to civilians of New York was a flaw as well due to the inability to keep a dirigible controlled in wind and the high flammability of the vehicles. Legally speaking there was another issue concerning a law that would not allow a dirigible to fly at the altitude required to dock.The idea of the mooring mast was an interesting and had it been realized dirigibles may have become significantly more popular. However the mooring mast was impractical and obstacles it posed overcame the ambition used to design it."	3	3		3																					
6297	6	The builders faced many challenging obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the empire state building. The builders first talked about such as Al Smith to try to make the Empire State building the tallest building in the state, so it would be a great forefront for travelers, and they got it up high to @NUM1 feet. But now there obstacle was to have a dirigible reach the top point of the empire state building. Al Smith wanted for the top of the empire state building to be a landing area, where they could go refueling for hours, or service, and to let passengers on or off the dirigible. So that was one of the obstacles that the builders had to face, to make it work.	0	1		1																					
6298	6	In building the mast and docking to the empire state building the constructers faced major problems. The Idea of a dock for dirigibles was a good idea at the time but faced both structrial and social problems. Architects and stated that over time the dock for the dirigible and climatic change would cause strain on the framework of the building. This led to more reconstruction and economic spendings. Another problem the builders faced was the location of the building itself. Newly built dirigibles had hydrogen rather than helium which led to flamibility. The Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire which led the builders to consider what would happened if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Docking of dirigibles led to many obstacles which ultimately led to the project shutting down. What was thought as the future is now the past.	3	2		3																					
6300	6	"Based on the expert, the builders had many obstacles that the builders had to face, from attemting to allow the dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle the builders had to face was the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened to accommidate the situation. The builders also had a problem with the wind because ""... the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, wich would puncture the dirigibles shell."	2	2		2																					
6302	6	Architects of the Empire State Building faced a tremendous amount of obstacles when they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith, the man who wanted to construct the tallest building, stated on December 11, 1929, that the Empire State would be 1,250 feet tall. It was decided that the building would have a mooring mast at the top for docking airships like the dirigibles. The blimps, however, was very spacey. Some were as long as one thousand feet in length. So a mooring mast sounds fitting. It would allow dirigibles/blimps to anchor there to refuel as well as letting the passengers off and on.Presently, the purpose of the mooring mast was never carried out. Problems that faced it was that most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and the German dirigible Hindenburg incident caused the Empire S Building's owners to realize how bad it would be if it happened above such a densely populated area like New York. The winds on top of the building is always changing. A dirigible tethered to the mooring mast would have the back of the ship swivel around and around. Weights couldn't be added to weigh down the back because the blimp would be right above people walking on the streets. Another practical reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for the blimp to even approach the building.On December 1930, U.S. Navy dirigible reached the mooring mast. However, it could not get close enough to tie the blimp in place due to forceful winds. The captain couldn't even take his hands off the controls in fear. In the late 1930's, the idea disappeared to be replaced by airplanes.	4	3		4																					
6304	6	Architects struggled with obstacles as they were constructing the Empire State Building. A @NUM1 ft. dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the building's frame. The Architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof. The observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the building had been framed, the roof had to be completed before the framing of the mooring mast could take place. The mast had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed.	1	1		1																					
6306	6	"The architects of the Empire State building ran into many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One of the main causes was nature. Winds/air current was a big risk. ""Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigibles shall..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This was a problem that no one could fix, no one can controll wind. Another big impact in the bunch of the mooring mast was law. ""The other practical reason why the dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This law would make it impossible to ever make it a full use of transportation. These obstacles architects couldn't overcome, and the original idea for the project was soon forgotten."	2	2		2																					
6307	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced some problems allowing the dirigibles to dock there. One of the problems was that they didn't really have landing gear. It was very hard to land a dirigibles on the ground, but in mid air it was almost impossible. Another reason was it was very unsafe. The pilot of the dirigibles would have to land it about @NUM1 feet in the sky and if they messed up they could potentially die. Another reason was that there was a law against airships from from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for people to land it up there. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when trying to make a dock for dirigibles.	2	2		2																					
6310	6	Some obstacles the builders faced during the construction of the Empire State Building's mooring mast was that the building was not stable enough to be able to moor an airship. They solved this easily by creating a stronger exoskeleton. Another obstacle that they faced was the high speed winds and being able to get passengers off and on. They never did solve this problem, and so the mooring project was shut down. The obstacles the builders faced were too many and this project soon became impossible to finish and it never was.	1	2		2																					
6313	6	"In the excerpt called ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was nature. That is because the wind at the top of the Empire State were changing a lot due to bad weather. The blimp would be moving around even if it was tied down the other challenge was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". That is not safe because if a blimp caught on fire at the building there are 102 floors that could burn down. Also because downtown New York is a very densely populated place. That is the obstacles the Empire State building faced in creating a docking area for blimps."	3	2		3																					
6317	6	Builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was finding a way to terner the end of the blimp without it blowing in the wind or putting the people below in danger. Another obstacle was laws against airships flying too low over urban areas. One final obstacle was the danger of hydrogen dirigibles in general. These obstacles proved far to many to outweigh the practicality of the mooring mast.	2	1		2																					
6319	6	There was one major problem with the dirigibles docking on the Empire State Building. This major problem was that the mooring mast is so high up in the air and downtown New York where The Empire State Building is located is such a crowded area. If something goes wrong it will affect a huge area because New York is such an urban area. It is a good idea but Al Smith did not take all the precautions that he needed to. Because if something does go wrong a lot will go wrong because downtown New York is such a crowded area. Thats the main obstacle that the builders had to overcome with letting dirigibles dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.	2	1		2																					
6321	6	The obsticals that the builders face in attempting to allow dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building are the law to fly that low to buildings. They also face structural problems in the building to be able to hold a dirigible. They also could not keep the dirigibles from moving because of the wind. They faced safty ishuse because of some dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and it is highly flamable. They did not want to have a fire over a densely populated area. They did not want what happen to the German dirigible Hindenburg in New Jersey to happen in down town New York. Dirigible have never dock there and never will because it is unsafe.	3	2		3																					
6323	6	"Based on the excerpt from The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced quite a few obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, Al Smith, the four-term governor of New York, was determined to create the tallest building in the world; even taller than the Chrysler building being @NUM1 feet tall. He also wanted the building to be aesthetically pleasing, and nothing ordinary. His determination led him to the idea of the mooring mast, which in itself came with additional obstacles. ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This meant that the frame would have to be modified and strengthened. Other obstacles included the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable, and could have caused a giant chaotic mess if over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" meaning that even if the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel everywhere, which was ""neither practical nor safe."""	3	4		4																					
6325	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. The builders couldn't just let the dirigible land that the step of the Empire State building. It would put to much pressure on the building. According to paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" It would have cost sixty thousand dollars worth of modification had to be made to the framework. Another obstacle they feared was they noticed how much worse it would be if the dirigible caught on fire on top of the Empire State Building. It would destroy part of the population because it would be in downtown New York. In paragraph @NUM2 the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. It says even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using the State building, where they would dangle above pedestrians was not safe."	3	3		3																					
6326	6	One of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the change in structure and extra cost and time in the completion of the building the building originally was going to have a flat roof but in order to dock blimps they had to construct a rocket-shaped mooring mast.Another problem the builders faced was the building and their idea of docking dirigibles being approved by experts. The @ORGANIZATION1 had to take tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The safety of the passengers of the derigible was very important and a huge obstacle for the construction of the Empire State Building. Two floors would be designated to passengers. Experts had to build a door strong enough to carry people and fight the blimps from swaying in the harsh winds.	2	3		3																					
6328	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.Although this sounded like a great idea and seemed possible at first, it was not. The idea of the mooring mast of the @CAPS1 State Building was neither practical nor safe. In paragraph fourteen, Marcia states why this dirigible idea wasn't so safe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. In the last sentence of paragraph fourteen, the author states another reason the idea wasnt safe nor practical. ""they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street,"""	1	1		1																					
6331	6	"Intended uses for buildings often are met with challenges. In the article ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by @PERSON1, the obstacles faced in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building are discussed. The first obstacle faced is stated in paragraph @NUM1, when to build a dock on top of the building the entire building would have to be inforced. This was an obstacle because it would be at a cost of @MONEY1. Another obstacle faced was the weather. Above the building violent air currents rage. These currents would cause the ship to swivel around and around the mooring. The final obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock was the law. According to the article, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas... Would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" The cost of reinforcing the building, the weather, and the laws were three obstacles faced in docking blimps to the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
6332	6	"The workers' constructing the Empire State Building faced many problems while building a dockable mooring mast for dirigibles, two of which were that the winds at that height were unpredictable and foriegn dirigibles using hydrogen instead of helium. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to Violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This quote shows how unsafe it could be for dirigibles to dock up that high. The high winds could cause loosening of the dirigible which could cause it to go flying off, which is unsafe to the pedestrians. Also, ""Most dirigibles from out side of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This shows yet another safety hazard the workers ran into. If something were to go wrong the dirigible could catch ablaze and come plummeting down to a large amount of pedestrians. These two are reasons or problem workers ran in to when deciding whether to not it would be safe or easy for dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast uptop the Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
6333	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when realizing the idea of letting dirigibles dock there. First off @CAPS1 is a major concern many Blimps were filled with Hydrogen which is extremely explosive. Second off the winds at the top of the tower were very strong, making docking terribly difficult if not impossible. Lastly, it was illegal; in New York there was a law forbidding @CAPS2 from flying to low, and to dock on the building it would fly in illegal airspace. The main obstecals the builders faced were @CAPS1 concerns, high winds and the illegality of thier project.	3	1		2																					
6335	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles they faced. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields, could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using those at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe. Another reason dirigibles could not dock there was because of the law against airships flying too low to urban areas. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
6337	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there are lack of a suitable landing area. In the excerpt they said ""The one obstacle was their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was the climate like wind pressure. For example they said ""The stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"". The next obstacle is dirigibles from outside of the United States. The dirigibles German's use hydrogen which is flammable. They said ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Thats obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock."	3	3		3																					
6339	6	Just like in life there are many obstacles. When you're trying to build a new invention that can't be easy. So there were many obstacles when building a docking area for drigibles on the Empire State building.One obstacle was the wind. People cannot control the wind or anything in the wind. So when it was really windy the back of the dirigibles would swing back and forth. When the Navy tried to tie up the dirigibles they couldn't get it close to the mooring mast because the winds were strong. That's one obstacle of building docking areas.Another obstacle is safety. The dirigibles used gas instead of helium, so it was very flammable. Also they don't have a lot of control over them. If the dirigible ever came crashing down it would kill a lot of pedestrians.If the Navy could fix these obstacles then the dirigible would be a good idea. They are hard to fix but probably possible. The better idea though is to just get rid of them.	2	3		3																					
6342	6	The architects of the Empire State Building faced too many challenges when trying to create a dock for dirigibles. First, there was the matter of safety. If a hydrogen zeppelin were to catch fire over New York City, it would be disastrous. It could start a huge city fire. Also, the wind was capricious up there, and would make it extremely difficult to dock and stay docked. The Navy tried to, but was unsuccessful, because the wind did not allow for them to even get close to the mast. Third, there were laws preventing airships from flying too low over cities, which really put an end to the whole idea. The plan was dangerous from the start, albeit a really awesome one.	2	3		3																					
6344	6	"From the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION1 the builders faced obstacles to allow dirigible to dock on the empire State building. One obstacle that the builders faced is the lack of suitable landing area on the roof. For that reasoning they needed more room to dock the dirigible. Later they had to put a steel needle on top of the empire State building so the balloons could dock up and let people out. Next obstacle that they faced was that ""outside the U.S. used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Therefore it was a risk to take to place a dirigible on top of the building if it blown up the building. Another reasing of an obstacle is that it was against the law for airships flying too low over urban areas for it can tie up and forceful winds will blow it in different directions. For that reasoning the winds could force the balloon to go in different directions and hit other building if the winds are strong. Those are obstacles the builders faced in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1."	3	3		3																					
6345	6	"The success of the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was prevented by many obstacles. Safety was one of the greatest reasons because ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen was flammable."" @CAPS1 starting in a densely populated city like New York could damage a lot of people. Nature also proved to be an obstacle because ""winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" that was neither practical nor safe. It would also be difficult to control the dirigible once it is tied to the mast because of the violent motion that the dirigible is in. There was also an existing law ""against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law made it illegal for any dirigible to even get near the mooring mast or tie to it. All of these obstacles were faced by the builders of the mooring mast, which eventually led to the disregarding of the idea of using the mooring mast for ships."	3	3		3																					
6346	6	Based on the exerpt, the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all for nothing. They spent extra money to restruture things but there was no need. Even if they found some way to get the dirigibles to dock, it was already illegal for aircraft to fly that close to cities.	1	1		1																					
6347	6	Though the idea to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building was seriously considered, safety and reality made in an unrealistic feat. In order for the mooring mast to successfully hold a dirigible, over @MONEY1 worth of modifications had to be made to the framework of the building. Still @CAPS1 got in the way, the greatest being safety. Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen gas rather than helium, which is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State building realized how bad a dirigible fire would be, and more so if it took place over the densely populated city of New York. Wind also was a serious factor that disassembled the idea. If the dirigible were to be tied to the mast, the back of the ship which swing around, and lead weights were out of the question. Blocks of lead hanging above pedestrians in the streets of New York was neither a practical nor safe idea. An additional obstacle was the existing law that would not allowed airships to fly low, or too close to urban areas. Even if it was attempted, ships would have a hard time docking because of forceful winds. These @CAPS1 were all stumbled across in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building, an idea that is no longer considered.	4	4		4																					
6351	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles included the added, stress to the buildings frame, The excerpt states in paragraph nine ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" This obstacle would could cause the whole building structure to collapse which could cause death and alot of destruction. Another obstacle included nature. The excerpt states in paragraph fourteen ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These violent air current could cause the dirigibles to lose control and hit the building and other buildings around it. The stress being added to the Empire State building and nature itself were the two main obstacles for the builders."	3	3		3																					
6353	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was in paragraph 6, the excerpt says, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" This means that the architects needed to build enough area to land the dirigibles, precisely and carefully. Another obstacle was in paragraph @NUM1, which said, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" This is explaining that the outcome of nature can be predicted, but it cannot be controlled. The amount of ""violent air currents"" can disturb the landing of dirigibles and it is ""neither practical nor safe"" for the dirigibles to dangle high above the pedestrians that are on the street. Unfortunately, Al Smith's plan to able the dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building was unsuccessful. There was a law stated in paragraph @NUM2, that made ""it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approached the area"". Instead of using the mooring mast, the dirigibles gave way to airplanes."	3	3		3																					
6354	6	"The builders of the dirigibles faced many obstacles trying to allow them to dock. One obstacle was there was a it was illegal for ""airships to fly to low"" over urban areas. It was illegal for it to ""tie up to the building. ""The purpose of the dirigibles was to be able to dock at the mast. If it couldn't fly up to the mast and dock there was no purpose in the mast or dirigibles. If they were to be able to dock they would need to be weighted down by lead weights. The problem with the weights was they would dangle above pedestrians. That was ""neither practical nor safe"" for the pedestrians on the street. If the dirigible docked at the top of the building, they would be held by a single cable. All the pressure on the cable would stress out the buildings frame. If that were to happen they would then have to strengthen and modify the buildings foundation. Overall the major obstacle they faced was not thinking through their plan of the dirigible. If they had thought it through these obstacles could have been prevented."	3	3		3																					
6355	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to dock tere. Many foriegn dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium to keep it a float. Hydrogen is extremely flammable, and has proven to be. on @DATE1 a German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire caused from hydrogen, in New jersey. When the owners of the Empire State building the severity of this happening they were turned off.Nature if anything was the biggest obstacle of them all. Considering the building was so tall, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent wind currents"". The law if anything was pretty important to get approved, and tere was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. So it would make it illegal for the dirigible ships to ever tie up to the building or to even approach the area."	3	3		3																					
6356	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A few of these problems included designing the mast and making sure that it was safe enough for dirigible to dock on. According to the excerpt, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" This meant that the builders would have to change the plan of how the building could be built to be able to hold the dirigibles. After they constructed a new layout for the building the conflict of safety came into play. Stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" Another big safety issue was ""nature itself."" ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The air currents made it so that they had to tie down the dirigible, but even then it is dangerous because it would be dangling over pedestrians on the street. The design and safety of the building both were big obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
6359	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, there were numerous obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle being that the architects could not have a mooring mast on top of the building because the dirigible would be, ""... held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This would cause the building to have to weak of a frame from the dirigible's load, as well as the wind pressure. Then the stress would be transmitted down to the foundation of the building. As a result, the building's frame was modified, costing ""Over sixty thousand dollars'"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). Another obstacle was designing the mooring mast, so passengers could be brought, ""... down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). In order for this to be completed, builders had to complete the roof. Lastly, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the moor mast was nature itself"" (@CAPS1 @NUM4). When the winds came into action at the top of the building, the dirigible would swivel around the mast. This would cause a safety hazard for pedestrians on the street. The Mooring Mast, supported many reasons as to the obstacles builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building."	4	4		4																					
6360	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast,, by @PERSON1, the author describes many obstacles builders faceded, to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problemb was the modifications that had to made to the buildings framework. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made,"" showing how expensive this product was going to be. A second potential problemb was that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This could cause many different complications. One of which would be how ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" a consiquence feared by the piolet of Los Angeles. Another problemb brought up by the winds shifting, would be the ship spinnig, potentialy resulting in catastrophe. They acomidated for the use with unpractical things, eventualy leading to the downfall of the mooring mast."	3	3		3																					
6362	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were many. The architects could not simply drop the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building that was only held by a single cable tether. This would add stress to the buildings frame. To be able to handle the dirigible's load the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and Strengthened, which was over sixty thosand dollars 'worth. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on top of the building were always shifting which could lead to the back of the ship swiveling around and around the mooring mast.	2	2		2																					
6363	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the architects faced was the stress the cable tether would put onto the building's foundation. In paragraph @NUM1, L�sted mentions, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" A very expensive problem to fix. Another challenge the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their was the lack of safety. Dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen, a highly flammable gas. In paragraph @NUM2 L�sted says, ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [an] accident could [be] if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The number 1 obstacle builders faced was nature itself. The violent winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. In paragraph @NUM3 L�sted reasons. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would be neither practical nor safe. The obstacles the builders faced were to egregious, so the idea had quietly disappeared"	3	4		4																					
6367	6	"There were some great obstacles for the dirigibles to be able to land and dock on the Empire State Building. At first the idea was great and staggering people's mind, but when the mast was being built the people realized it would not work. The first problem for the dirigble the law for airships to be so low over urban areas which makes it illegal for the ship to even be that close The second problem was ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents (paragraph @NUM1)"" which means it would be very dangerous for the passengers to be comming on and off board of the dirigible. The last problem is that foreign dirigibles use hydrogen which is flammable and to put it over a dencely populated area could cause horrific damage. These precautions would have to be taken which were obstacles for The Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
6369	6	"There were many obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. One obstacle they faced is the safety of the passengers when the dirigibles would dock and the frame work of the building wouldn't collapse. I know this because in between paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 the excerpt says, ""'One set of egineers are here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast.'"" The mast weighs alot so they're afraid it will put too much pressure on the empire state building. The egineers were also afraid of the dirigibles blowing up because the dirigibles use hydrogen. Hydrogen is way more flammable than helium. I know this because in between paragraph @NUM3 and @NUM4 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. These were a few of many obstacles the workers faced"	3	2		3																					
6370	6	"In this excerpt the Architect/Workers had to face several obstacles while trying to construct a docking area on the Empire State Building for dirigibles. They had to find away for this huge mast not to kill the building frame The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand foot dirigible moored the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" They had to find away to make the load less bearing on the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" To fix this Architects and Workers must modifie the steel frame because of the new situation. After this was built and done they had to face the facts that this was imposible to do or not allowed. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" The Architects and worker went through so many obsticales to then find out its dangerous and the law not to fly so close to urban area's."	3	3		3																					
6373	6	"Al Smith, a former governor of New York, led the way in constructing the Empire state building. This building was being constructed to be the tallest building, taller than the Chrysler building which stood at @NUM1 feet tall. In order to make the Empire State building taller than the Chrysler building, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top for docking dirigibles. This idea faced many obstacles. First, the passage states that ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthen to accommodate this new situation."" This would cost a large amount of money to construct. Also, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, the passage states the issue that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders realized many problems after the mooring mast was constructed. The builders should have thought of each situation before building the mast which cost a lot of money. Although the mast was no longer used, the Empire State building still stood at the height of @NUM2 feet, the tallest building built."	3	3		3																					
6374	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building never achieved their goal. They had failed to predict the potential problems that they would face. First of all, they couldn't proceed to attempt to land the dirigible on the Mooring Mast because it would be dangerous. Indeed, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1). They realized the complications it would imply if there were to be an incident like the one in New Jersey. Also, nature was an obstacle to the project; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Consequently, due to the winds, the back of the dirigible would be swinging around the mooring mast, which would be a huge danger to the streets. As a final point, dirigibles wouldn't be able to moor at the Empire State Building because there was a pre-existing law concerning how low airships could fly over urban areas."	3	3		3																					
6375	6	The architects didn't realize how many potential problems the mooring mast would bring until it had failed. The greatest reason why the dirigibles couldn't land was purely safety complications. Many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Another main reason was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were very violent and could easily push a dirigible in the wrong direction. Before these problems, there was an already existing law against the flying of airships too low over urban areas. Dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State building because it was unsafe and illegal.	3	3		3																					
6376	6	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building had many obsticales to deal with. They had to make sure the dirigiles good go high enough and be safe for passengers to board and get off safely. The builders had to deal with alot.""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of @ORGANIZATION1 roof."" Because of the buildings hight they were uable to make things work. The dirigible was too much and it added stress to the buildings frame, to unload things it was to difficult the floor it needed to be on was too low.""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the Final the final instalation of the landing gear."" The project was so difficult that they had to quit the task and expand at another time. The workers were devistated."	1	2		2																					
6377	6	"There were many problems to over come in the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The first problem to over come was the stress a thousand foot long dirigible would add to the buildings frame. This was solved by spending over @MONEY1 in modifying the building's frame work. Another problem was a law against airships flying too low around urban environments, brought up in paragraph @NUM1. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 is writing about the wind. At 1,250 feet high the wind is violent, and would swing a dirigible around to much to be safe, and ends could not be weighed down for fear of injuring a pedestrian. Those were three signifigant reasons the mooring mast failed."	3	3		3																					
6378	6	In attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building the builders faced many problems. The first problem was the fact that most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The problem with hydrogen is that it is highly flamable and would be a huge risk to have a hydrogen dirigible over a city full of pedestrians because it could catch on fire and hurt them.Secondly, the wins at the height of the Empire State Building were always shifting which presented great risk to pilots. If their dirigible got blown off course it could collide with other tall buildings in the city. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles got blown off course by the strong winds and the pilot could not take his hands off the controls in fear of hitting other buildings.Lastly, there was a pre-existing law that would have made it illegal for a dirigible to have entered the airspace around the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
6380	6	During 1929 when Al Smith announced that he was going to make a docking port for blimps at the top of the Empire State Building there were many obstacles in the way of the architects building design. Building a dock for blimps at the top of the worlds tallest building is no easy task. They should have realized previous to the project that this was a lost cause, but they tried it anyways.The architects on the project had to devise a plan that would strengthen the main support beams of the building while still being able to control the movements of the back of the dirigibles due to uncontrolable wind conditions. Unfortunatly they never found a way to successfully complete this task and because of that the Empire State Building could never dock blimps. 	1	1		1																					
6381	6	In the 1930's this would have been a difficult obstacle to face. the idea altogether was doubted by many People. the first @CAPS1 was comparing in height with the chrysler building. and the mooring mast wold have worked in theory but in reality had to many Problems. It was a potentially dangerous attempt.	0	0		0																					
6382	6	When the empire state building was constructed it ran into many problems attempting to dock dirigibles there. One problem they ran into is that most overseas blimps were still filled with hydrogen, which is a very flammable gas. The constructors did not want to re-create the Hindenburg accident over a densely populated area such as New York City. The greatest obstacle to the mooring mast was nature itself. The wind currents atop the building were violent and always shifting. Docking a Dirigible there in those conditions would cause it to swivel around the building and become unsafe for passengers. That is why the mooring mast never fulfilled it's purpose.	3	2		3																					
6383	6	"The building of the mooring mast on top of the empire state building was very poorly thought out. This is the reason why they faced so many obstacles. From the very start Al Smith never thought about the safety of the people. ""When other countries used hydrogen rather than helium this was a cause for very flammible possibilities. If this happened in New Jersey how bad would it be in a densely populated place like New York City. I could never imagine walking down the street and a lead weight being dropped on my head. In New York there was violent air currents and when the dirigibles would be tied up they would sway. The idea was to hold them in place by lead weights. This was not practical or safe. The one thing that should have been thought of before it was ever constructed was the law. It was illegal for a airship to fly low over urban areas or even to tie up to buildings. In conclusion everything should have been thought out before making hype about something that was not safe, and that was illegal."	3	3		3																					
6386	6	"When Al Smith first came up with the plan to use the Empire State Building is a mooring mast, he had no idea how obstacles they would face in a attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One large obstacle was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The reason this is so unsafe is because if the gas inside ever happened to catch on fire, the entire craft would exploded in flames. This is a hazard to those in the ship, as well as those in the streets below. Another obstacle was the high winds at the top of the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This was a problem because it would cause to the dirigible to move all over the place. The idea of using lead weights to weigh it down was proposed, but they would be a danger to pedestrians below. A third and final obstacle they faced was the stress a dirigible would cause on the building's frame. The building's design was not capable of handling the stress of a dirigible tied to its mast, without changing the design, the dirigible would probable tear the building apart. The only solution was to strengthen the building ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework,"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). That is a ridiculous amount of money they had to spend just to make it possible for the dirigible to dock. It is easy to see how difficult the project was based on the many obstacles the builders had to face."	4	4		4																					
6388	6	While attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. The first obstacle they dealt with was the fact that mooring such heavy blimps would add stress to the building. In fact, 'the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation.' Another obstacle they endured was the fact that the hydrogen gas used in the dirigible was very flammable. As bad as the Hindenburg explosion was, it could have been much worse, 'if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.' It was also very dangerous that the blimps would fly so low over an urban area. Lastly, the strong winds would making mooring difficult. Winds that high up on a building are, 'constantly shifting due to violent air currents.' The workers clearly had many problems in building the mast and it just couldn't be completed.	3	3		3																					
6390	6	"In the excert The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example One big problem they faced was the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof."" This operation would not be possible because ""A thousand  foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings foundation, wich is nearly 11 hundred feet below."" the steel frame of the empire state building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new sittoation. One big obstacle they faced was a big Safety problem. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @CAPS1 used @CAPS2 drogen rather than @CAPS3 lium, and @CAPS2 drogen is very flammable. the biggest obstacle to face was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights but using them at the empire state building, were they would be hanging on top of padestrans on the street was neither practical nor safe. These are the obstacles the empire stat building faced."	3	3		3																					
6394	6	Some obstacles the builders faced were too much stress to the buildings frame. It would have to transmit all the weight and pressure all the way to the building's foundation. Also there would only be one cable holding it in place. The cable was called a tether. Another obstacle would be an existing law saying that you cant moor your ship there because you are flying to low. In December 1930 the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible tried parking there but they were affraid of the wind knocking it into another building. Therefor they went threw a few hard obstacles but in the end they fixed it and made it happen.	2	2		2																					
6397	6	Diregible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1 on @DATE1 The owners of the Empire state building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York        In The MOORING MAST          Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty mile per hour and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling some were as longht as four blocks in New york city The one obstacle to their expanded us in New york city was the lack of a Suitable landing area	1	1		1																					
6400	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles. ""... the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This means it was difficult to land the Dirigibles. Another problem they faced was nature. The wind and weather could make a landing the dirigibles very dangerous. ""Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which called in a line from the front of the ship, and tied it to the mast."" (@CAPS1 6). This means if the wind blows in the wrong direction, or competes with the electric winch, it would be difficult and dangerous to land the dirigible. Another obstacle was the expenses. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This means they had to pay a lot of money, which is an easy. That was definitely an obstacle they had to face."	3	3		3																					
6401	6	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 thought that they had a great idea and that they were pioneers. They soon realized that there were some problems with their ideas. One major problem was safety. As noted in paragraph @NUM1, most @LOCATION3 dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was wind. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speed. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. After the risks and rewards were balanced, they realized it just wasn't worth it.	2	3		3																					
6403	6	One problem that the builders has was that they had to make the mast big enough. Some dirigibles would be @NUM1 feet long. If the just dropped a mast on top of the Empire State Building becaus the stress of a thousand-foot dirigible held to the Empire State Building by just one cable tether, there would be a lot of stress put on the building's frame. If they did the weight of the dirigible and the wind all of that stress and pressure would be put on the buildings foundation that was nearly eleven hundred feet below which was not safe at all. They had to go through all of the different possibilities and they also had to make sure that it was going to be safe. While designing the mast they had to consider the winds at the top of the building, the winds were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents. If they did design a good mast the dirigible would be dangling above pedestrians, which was not safe.	3	3		3																					
6406	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon l�sted she explained the challenges dirigibles faced when trying to dock to the Empire state building. The @CAPS1 had to take into account the obstacles of the make up of dirigibles, the building structure and weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure. This took time and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications hat to be made to the buildings frame work"". Lastly weather conditions tested the @CAPS1, on the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictabled. They often shift because of ""violent air current"". No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe. Due to winds, and structure of the building as well as blimp, the @CAPS1 couldn't create a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
6408	6	When Al Smith first had his idea to build a mast on which to dock dirigibles, it started out as friendly competition. However, nobody predicted the obstacles that would be encountered while trying to execute the plan. One of these obstacles was simply that it was unsafe. Dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flammable. If there was an accident the results would be devastating in places populated as New York City. Another obstacle was the wind. The wind currents at the top of the building shifted constantly, making the dirigible swing from side to side, which was dangerous for passengers. One more obstacle was the fact that there was a law that prohibited airships from flying below a certain height in cities. Clearly, many obstacles were encountered, and the mast never ended up serving its intended purpose.	3	3		3																					
6413	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was that they had to add over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes to the buildings framework because docking a dirigibles on the building would put a lot of stress on the framework and foundation of the building. Another problem was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used hydrogen which was highly flammable and an accident at this building would be very dangerous because it such a densely populated area. Nature was said to be the biggest obstacle ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (line @NUM1) This would cause the dirigible to sway back and forth uncontrollably. This would endager pedestrians below and passengers on the dirigible. Lastly, a law was in place against airships flying too low in urban areas. All of these obstacles made docking a dirigible here impossible."	4	3		4																					
6414	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders found many obstacles on the way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building Some of those obstacles were as follow. The main concern was the safety of the passenger boarding and unboarding as well as the people below The concern for the people below was how the dirigible sometimes was floating with hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. So they didn't want chances of the dirigible blowing up. Another main concern was there was an ""exsiting law over airships flying to low over urban areas"" (par @NUM1) The dirigible floated with the air and being as long as @NUM2 ft. the back of the dirigible where it wasn't securely fastened would circle around the mooring from the high wind currents. The winds were shifting all the time so it was a very big safety issue. Another obstacle was the dirigible docking, was mainly put into place because of jealousy. The man was jealous because his competition Al Smith was catching up with him before the idea of dirigible came to mind."	3	2		3																					
6415	6	"Base on the excerpt the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They not going to do it because it might hit other building or fly into other self. ""Could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1 lines @NUM2). That mean it wasn't safe."	1	1		1																					
6416	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was figuring a practical and safe way to dock the dirigibles. Practicity and safety were an obstacle because the builders of the Empire State building were the first to attempt a docking dirigibles on air, @CAPS1 they had no past trials to refer to. In this project practicity and safety worked together. For example ""..engineers [had] to dope out a practical, workable arrangement..."" @CAPS1 that the airships could be moored to the mast easily and secure. This would assure the passengers safety as well as stability to the building.The second obstacle the builders faced was distributing the stress added to the building as the dirigible docked. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" @CAPS2 all of this stress to the foundation was a challenge because the foundation ""... was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Another challenge that arose was that, to accommodate this situation ""the steelframe [of the building had] to be modified and strengthened..."" The modification to the buildings framework was worth ""over sixty thousand dollars..."" In conclucion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and attempting to dock dirigibles in their building."	3	4		4																					
6422	6	On December 11, 1929 a man named Al Smith announced he was building the world's tallest building at 1,250 feet This building was the Empire state building in New York, that would be used for a dirigible mooring But, there would be a few obstacles to face, that would cause the dirigible mooring to not successfully be used.Al Smith announced he was building this mooring mast but did not announce potential obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building would face when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the largest obstacles would be the wind factor, causing the dirigible's back end to sway. Another issue, would be having the foreign dirigibles full of flammable gases to be moored too close to a densely populated area. Also, before any dirigibles could be moored, constructors had to spend extra time and money to make the building much more sturdy, to hold the dirigibles.	2	2		2																					
6423	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One was the architects couldn't drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof. The thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The second problem was the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The third problem was the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation. It was over sixty thousand dollars worth to make the buildings framework. But unfortunately all the problems were unsolved and the height made it desirable to postpon to a later date but instead of becoming the transportation of the future, they had been given away to airplanes.	3	2		3																					
6426	6	"In paragraph 6 it said ""New York City was the lack of a suitable Landing space"" Another obstanke in paragraph @NUM1 was the Nature it self the winds was push the dirigible around in the back of it. The other obstakle was in paragraph @NUM2 the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the problem that the Empire builders faced"	2	2		2																					
6427	6	"The builders and engineers involved in allowing The Empire State Building to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast around one thousand two hundred and fifty feet in the air faced many obstacles. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, taken from The Empire State Building, the reader is taken through the journey in allowing dirigibles, or blimps, to refuel and transport passengers atop the Empire State Building. This was not an easy task; in fact it was never achieved. Some reasons for this are the very building itself. The mooring mast was to be on top of the building, and its height and weight and wind pressure on the building was dangerous. In paragraph nine it is stated that: ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" But even more than just the building itself, the location of the Empire State Building in densely populated downtown New York created a few major obstacles. First, most international blimps used Hydrogen rather than helium-which is highly Flammable. A fire or explosion in the location that the mooring mast was to be located would be devastating to the city. Secondly, there were shifting winds ""due to violent air currents"" atop the building. They caused the backend of the dirigible to swerve. Weights could not be used on the blimp, though, because of the people below and the height at which everything took place. Finally, there were laws in place against airships flying too low over urban areas. So essentially, the objective of this project could not be reached ed unless legislation was changed. All of these obstacles made it very hard to dock dirigibles on top of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building, However to blimps did attempt to land there. The U.S. Navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" and the Goodyear Blimp ""Columbia"" both were unsuccessful in landing due to intense winds and sharp spires of nearby buildings. This project is an example of a beneficial idea which was nearly impossible to execute."	4	4		4																					
6428	6	Based on the excerpt, I dont think they should have attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. According to the excerpt, I think this because something really bad could of happened and something probably has happend, But back then they really had no choice except for balloons.	0	0		0																					
6430	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to adopt there was very hard for them. A dirigible having to dock on the Empire State Building is probably not easy. A mooring mast added to the top of the building. Would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling. The obstacles were that Al Smith demanded the builders to make the Empire State Building more tall. Also to make it more ornamental, and to put in like a pyramid at the top. The workers were exhausted. The one obstacle that the builders did was to expand their use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The other obstacles were that the architects and the builders of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was by nature itself.	2	1		2																					
6431	6	"This project towards ""transportation of the future"" for the Empire State Building was no easy task. One of the major obstacles was the ""stress to the building's frame"". The workers had to make over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to accommodate the dirigibles. This would strengthen the frame of the building so that the wind pressure would be ""transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". Another issue with this mooring mast was the ""violent air currents"" that were ""constantly shifting"" the winds on the roof. This would cause the dirigible to swing around the building while it was docked. Allowing these giant aircrafts to ""dangle high above pedestrians on the street"" was ""neither practical nor safe. These obstacles caused the workers and architects to postpone the build."	3	2		3																					
6433	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced multiple obstacles when trying to obstruct dirigibles to dock on the top of there building. They faced obstacles like laws, saftay problems, and also natural problems when trying to successed this gutsey idea. They firsted faced the problems of law, ""An existing law aginst airships flying too low over urban areas. This law posed an obstacle for the builders because they would have to dock the blimp without flying in this restricted fly zone. The Second problem was dealing with saftey, ""when dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed... Owners of the Empire State building relized how much worse that accident could have been over downtown New York."" After blimps were proven to be highly flamable the builders saw that an accident over highly populated New York City would be worse than a rural area. Finally the builders face problems with nature, ""dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" The builders relized that the drastic change in @LOCATION2 at the top of the building where not apperate for a blimp. These designers had more than a mundane idea but it was shot down with the multiple obstacles that a-rose."	3	4		4																					
6436	6	"There are a couple of obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these obstacles is that it would add stress to the building's Frame. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". Another obstacle was that the steel would have to be modified. ""The steel of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" These are some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to alow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
6438	6	The builders of the Empire state building encountered many obstacles that prevented dirigibles from docking there. A main concern was safety, after Hindenburg, a German dirigible, was destroyed by fire over New Jersey. This prompted the realization that had such a disaster occurred over New York, a highly populated urban area, it could have been far worse. Another obstacle that was encountered was bad weather conditions. The winds on the top of the Empire State Building were consistently shifting, making it impossible for a dirigible to stay unmoving. If the dirigible was so unsteady, it would be very unsafe for it to be floating above millions of people. Lastly, it was illegal for a dirigible to tie up to the mast or even approach the area due to a law that prevented all airships from flying too low over urban areas. Due to all the obstacles faced by the builders of the Empire State Building, it is apparent that dirigibles were simply not meant to dock there.	3	4		4																					
6441	6	The problems that the workers had to face in letting the dirigibles dock at the empire state Building were crusal & @CAPS1 Because first if they would of tried to Put Mooring Mast on the top of the Building Roof And then have A thousand pound Dirigible on top of It holdn @CAPS2 would be to Much for it to hold. And the stress of the dirigible's weight and wind pressure will need to be transmitted to the Buildings foundation which was 11 hundred feet Below The frame of the Building would have to be stronger Modified @CAPS3 it could work But it would be Over @MONEY1 to Put into the Building frame work in order for it to succeed But the Most Reason why it was difficult for the workers is Because of the winds And if landed they would need weights to weigh it down but it would be dangling high above Pedestrians witch wasn't Practical or Safe.	2	3		3																					
6445	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were lack of area, populated area, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ""Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air."" Hydrogen is very dangerous and it's flammable and Empire State Building is located in a populated area, so it's dangerous to risk. Also as German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it proved to the owners of Empire State Building that it's more dangerous than it looks. Other reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the top of the building was the existing law agains all airships flying too low over populated areas."	2	3		3																					
6447	6	"the obstecles the builders faced was many of them. one of the things they faced was that they dident No if they wanted to build the tower in the first place. And the other reason were ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather then helium. And hydrogen is highly flammable. And one of the greater obstacles was mooring mast was nature its self."	1	2		2																					
6448	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @PERSON1, builders of the Empire State building faced many problems. Their first problem was; ""[t]he architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of... the flat roof"". The weight of the mast would make the framework crumble, so the builders had to modifie and strengthen the steel frame of the empire state building. Secondly, most foreign dirigibles were highly flamable making it highly dangerous for on two moor overapopulated New York city. Also nature itself was a problem. The winds at the top of the building were just so strong it'd be dangerous to moor there. And finally, the law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areas. The mooring mast atop of the Empire State building was a good idea but it was very dangerous, highly unlikely and against the law."	3	3		3

6450	6	"The Empire State Building was built as the tallest building in the World and even today still remains one of the tallest. It had design plans with more of a purpose then just being the tallest building, however. It was supposed to serve as a passenger exchange and a refueling dock for dirigibles. Most people do not know this though because there were many complications involved with the architectural designs of this plan for the mast. Architects knew it would not be easy to build such a creation and that they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building."" They knew, for example that the building needed to be modified to accommodate for the added stress from the mast and the height of the building would need to be increased. They made the necessary changes to the building but the realities of the progect soon set in, and the mast was never built, ""the greatest reason being for safety."" The hydrogen used to power the dirigibles was highly flamable and endangered the citizens of New York  Also, according to the aricle, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" There are powerful winds at that high of an altitude that would blow and make it difficult as for the dirigibles to be properly controlled and navigated."	3	3		3																					
6455	6	"At sporting events, people have gotten used to seeing the @CAPS1 blimp or the Goodyear blimp. Now they are used for advertising but not many people know that they were once thought of as transportation. The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, shows not only the original purpose for the mast of the Empire State building was for mooring blimps, but also shows the many problems faced with blimp travel. Safty was a big issue because the blimps, or dirigibles, were filled with Hydrogen, which is highly flamable. It would be a huge disaster if one of them exploaded over New York City. Another problem was that the winds were always changing and there was no way to keep the dirigibles from moving in the wind and it could be dangerous. There was, also, a law about how low you can fly over urban areas and in order to land correctly, you would be breaking that law, and flying that low would risk wind pusing the dirigible into the top of the building and puncturing it. Al Smith had a good idea for the Empire State Building's mast, however their were to many problems to make it a reality."	3	3		3																					
6456	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The man who came up with the plan was Al Smith, who saw the opportunity to add a mooring mast to the top of the building. Which this would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. But with this came lots of work. And they couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building. The architects had to make plans on how they were going to set up the mooring mast. In the story it says ""Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building's skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows."""	1	1		1

6458	6	They had to build the tower just right or els there would be landing problems if they added the sight seeing thing People would pay any price but the price of keeping it stable was not worth the effort. In the end the people were like going to make this a very popular thing but it was not up to them if it was or wasnot popular Wind and Landing always stood in there way so they paid alot-o-money to restableise the building. This ended up being a profit and ride of a lifetime	1	1		1																					
6461	6	"In ""The mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced was having to try and make it perfect, especially for the designers. They went through alot of work, effort, and time. They tried to make different arrangements for the government people. The dirigibles were always near the mooring mast. They were afraid that it would knock over one day. They also, wanted them to become the transportation of the future. The transportation was to the airplanes. The dirigibles became the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for the sightseers. So, their plans didn't quite work out as planned, but everything else seemed to work out okay."	1	1		1																					
6462	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles in trying to dock dirigibles there, but they had to figure a way around. The architects believed that the mooring mast would work and they started building. Soon enough, problems evolved that could not be fixed. An example of one of their problems is that dirigibles use more hydrogen than helium, which makes it very flammable. If the dirigible had an accident over New York many people would be hurt. Another factor that goes with this is the wind currents. The wind is too strong that the dirigible would be swirling around even if it was tied up. However, they could use lead weights to keep it still but if they fell it would hurt some pedestrians walking by. Furthermore, the state law made it illegal for airships to fly too low which made it impossible for dirigibles to be tied to the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. After all these problems, the architects never added the landing gear to the mooring mast because they knew that it would not be used as it was intended to.	3	3		3																					
6463	6	"In the exerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders faced obstacles in an attempt as to allowing dirigibles to dock. One example of an obstacle that the builders had to face was how to attach the mooring mast on top of the building. In paragraph nine it says, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" They had to come up with a safe way to attach it. Another example of an obstacle was that they had to strength and modified the building because in paragraph nine it stated that ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" The last example was in paragraph nine when they explained that ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundren feet below."" The Stress might be so much for the building that it could cause the building to collapse. In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 the builders faced many obstacles as to allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building in New York City."	3	2		3																					
6471	6	The builders faced many obstacles when attempting to allow the dirigibles to dock. The first was that they couldn't just put the mast on top of the building, it would have put too much stress on the buildings frame. They had to transmite the stress all the way down to the foundation of the building. They did over @MONEY1 worth of framework to the building.Their next obstacle was to find a safe way to dock and unload the ships, which was impossible. First off the ship couldn't even reach the building because the violent ever-changing winds were too much to control the ship in. But even if they did dock the back of the ship would have been pushed around and around the mast.Another obstacle was a law that prevented airships from flying that low over urban areas. So now the ships couldn't ever approach the building to tie off to the mast.	4	4		4																					
6472	6	"Although the problems with docking a dirigible were not considered in the beginning, the builders of the Empire State building faced these obstacles eventually. Their ""greatest reason was one of safety"" for the passengers and pedestrians below in the city. Many countries ""used hydrogen rather than helium"" in their dirigibles, and ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could have caused several problems in the future. A German dirigible called Hindenburg was destroyed in Lakehurst, @CAPS1 because of fire, and it was after that incident that the owners of the Empire State building realized that an accident like that could not take place ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York,"" because too many people could be injured. Even though safety was a large problem, ""the greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" when a dirigible was ""tethered to the mooring mast,"" the violent air currents at the top of the building would cause the ""back of the ship [to] swivel around and around."" The air currents not only made it hard to hold the dirigible steady, it made it extremely challenging to even reach the mooring mast. The idea of using lead weights to hold down the end of the blimps was not used because dangleing weights above @CAPS2 ""was neither practical nor safe."" one last obstacles the builders faced was the existing ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law prevented any dirigibles from being tied to or even approach the building. However, two blimbs (Los Angeles from U.S. Navy and the @LOCATION4 from Goodyear) did try to reach the building but were stopped due to the wind speeds. The several obstacles that presented themselves to the builders of the Empire State Building prevented the mooring mast from being used for the future of transportation."	4	4		4																					
6473	6	In the @CAPS1 The @CAPS2 Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles. The largest obstacle they faced was safety, most dirigibles who were comming from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable. Another obstacle was just nature itself. Winds were constantly shiffting caused by violent air currents. Another obstacle was there was a law against airships flying to low over urban areas. The builders should have relized all the hazards. They were facing, and just dropped the idea of using the moorning mast for dirigibles and their passengers.	3	2		3																					
6474	6	In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak.The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put @MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building.An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives.I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still use the mooring mast today.	2	3		3

6483	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were harsh. The builders, in theory, thought everything would work perfectly. They had to face that they did not do enough to see if there would be any problems with having the dirigibles dock there. As I read I noticed the building never fulfilled it's purpose. This was because most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen, not helium, hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse a fire could have been if it were to happen above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. So in reality this idea was not safe and the builders had to go through building it, having it all done. Then realizing the idea was not pursuable.	1	2		2

6487	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there include: hydrogen gas being highly flammable, high winds and wind shifts at the top of the building, laws that airships could not fly too low over cities such as New York City.The problem of hydrogen gas came to them when a blimp blew up in New Jersey, then the owners realized how bad it could've been in the city. When it comes to high winds the excerpt says, ""... if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" Also, the law mentioned would have made it illegal for blimps to come close to the Empire State Building"	2	3		3

This was a big problem because now they had to fix their desing. lastly another problem was the compotition, ""Al Smith relized that he was close to loosing the title of the worlds talest building.

6489	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was that a dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable, would add stress to the buildings frame. The still frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened to withstand the stress of the dirigibles load and wind pressure. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents, causing the ship to swivel around and around the mooring mast. Another major obstacle was that there was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for the ships to ever tie up or even approached the building. The last obstacles the builders had to get around was the issue with safety. Most dirigibles used either helium or hydrogen, both highly flammable gases. When the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the builders realized how dangers that could be over a populated area. These are just some of the many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to take into consideration when attempting to allow dirigible to dock their.	4	3		4																					
6492	6	"Many problems faced the construction workers of the Empire State building, @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock. To begin, construction for dirigibles on the Empire State building was dangerouse. Dirigibles couldn't do many basic things to dock at the building. For example ""dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) Mooring was impossible because it was against ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" (@CAPS2 @NUM1) This made it illegal for a ship to tie to the Empire State Building. Also, the greatest threat to dirigibles was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS2 @NUM3) Because of this and be fact that construction on such a high building at the time was unpractable, dirigibles never touched the Empire State building. So to close, the difficulty of building dirigible landing gear and of landing dirigibles ultimately ened the Empire State Building docks."	3	3		3																					
6494	6	"When the builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they came across many issues. One is the stress on the building from the added mast. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all they way down to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" @CAPS1 how the stress factors on the building troubled its construction. Another obstacle to its construction was that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". When building the dock, constructors ran into issues which eventually overcame them and led to its uselessness."	2	2		2																					
6496	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced one giant obstacle. They faced the risk of blowing up the building. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This is one example from the excerpt that could turn into the biggest obstacle. If one were to explode above this building then the building would die. Also a lot of people would die from it too. That is one of the biggest obstacles they faced."	1	1		1																					
6497	6	The builders of the Empire State Building and encountered numerous obstacles while trying to set up the mooring mast for dirigibles including a weakened framework, nature and weather, potential fire hazards, and U.S. laws. Because the building was not originally designed to hold down dirigibles, the frame was not sturdy enough to survive the pulling and moving of the blimp in the air. The dirigibles would also be vacillating in the high and unpredictable winds at the top of the building, which was 102 storeys. Aside from pulling loose or damaging the building itself, the dirigibles were in danger of being punctured by another building's spire. Damage to the dirigible in any way was a very dangerous possibility, as the area in New York City around the Empire State Building is densely populated. If the dirigible were to catch fire and blowup, such as the case with the German Hindenburg blimp, many pedestrians or other structures could be seriously damaged. This kind of catastrophe was also probable because of the flammable gases like hydrogen used to keep the blimps afloat. Finally, the builders of the Empire State Building faced problems with the U.S. government, whose laws forbid airships to come that close to urban areas like @ORGANIZATION2. It would be illegal for a dirigible to fly near enough to the building to moor to it. In conclusion, many issues surfaced for the builders as they attempted to transform the Empire State Building into a docking station for dirigibles.	4	4		4

6502	6	"There were many obstacles that got in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building. Most of these had to do with the framework of the building and safety. Workers encountered obstacles with the new plan of mooring blimps even before they started constructing. To be able to support the air crafts, the frame of the building would have to be ""modified and strengthened,"" or else there was no way the building would stay standing. Safety was the main issue with fulfilling the plan to moor blimps to the Empire State Building. After everything was built and finished, it was soon realized that the ""mooring mast was destined to never fulfill its purpose"". Some reasons for this were because foreign dirigibles were made mostly of hydrogen, which is highly flammable and extremely unsafe. Also, just attaching a dirigible to the mast would be dangerous due to winds that were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Not only was unsafe to moor dirigibles to the tallest building in the world, but it was also illegal. Airships were not allowed to fly to low over populated areas. After the construction of the mooring mast, it was soon realized that would never be used."	3	3		3

6505	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced alot of problems in attempting to allow dirigibles. One is that in the story it says that dirigibles use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If it got a hole in it then it would catch on fire. Another problem was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships lying too low over urban areas. Those are some obstacles the builders faced.	3	2		3

It also was'nt safe having the dirigibles weighed down with lead weights so it wont swivel around the mooring mast. Also sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frameworK.

In the reading they talk about how there is not much landing area in @ORGANIZATION2 but, although adding space for landing The height of the mast would be dangerous, not only for passengers but for those who were on ground level. Also, the thousand plus pound craft would add stress to the building's frame; so the frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the @LOCATION2. -(Which would cost over @MONEY1) the Idea proved to be unsafe when the German dirigible blew up at a @ORGANIZATION1 - they realized how dangerous that could be above densely populated area like New York City.	2	2		2																					
6512	6	"In the passage, The Mooring Mast, Marcia Amidon L�sted discusses several adversities and obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of their many obstacles they faced, was ""the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was niether practical nor safe."" However before thinking of landing dirigibles, architects had to figure out a way to get the mooring mast on top of the building. They ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the building's flat roof."" @CAPS1 ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened.""

One obstacle was the fact that most diribles from outside the United States used hydrogen in their blimps instead of helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The builders of the Empire State building did not realize that this was a problem until on May 6, 1937, the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire in New Jersey (paragraph @NUM1). It was only then that they understood how bad matters would be if a dirigible caught fire right over the masses of people in New York. Another obstacle was nature. The winds on the top of the building were always violently changing, making the dirigible swivel around over the heads of the @LOCATION2. As stated in paragraph @NUM2, such a problem could be easily solved by weighting down the dirigible with lead weights. However, using lead weights that could accidentally fall on the people below was an unsafe way to keep the dirigible still. Lastly, as written in the beginning of paragraph @NUM3, there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" By law, the whole idea of using the Empire State Building as a docking area for dirigibles was illegal, and rightfully so. There were too many complications, and one spark or strong breeze could jeopardize countless of lives. These reasons are why by the 1930s the plan to create a mooring mass for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was dropped."	4	4		4																					
6514	6	Governer Al Smith of New York had a vision. He wanted to have a building constructed that would surpass the current tallest building in the world, The Chrysler Building. He succeeded in doing so. The Empire State Building was now the tallest building in the world at 1,250 feet. But there were more plans for this building. At the time, aviation pioneers had dreamed of travel by dirigible, and now a mooring mast was to be built at the top of the building for docking these airships. But what should have been a cautious project, turned out to be a dangerous one. There should have been a lot more precaution going into this project. Dirigibles could be very dangerous in a widely populated area like New York City. If the dirigible were to catch fire and explode, people could get hurt. And at such a high altitude, it is likely. People were just starting to understand the dangers of this project halfway into it, which is why it was called off do to lack of safety.	1	1		1																					
6515	6	"The obstacles that the builder faced is making sure that the building was stable enough. The architects knew that they could not just drop a mooring mast on the Empire State Building. Al Smith commented and said that the mooring mask was on a okay level and how they were working on things. A set of engineers are working finding a workable and faster arrangements. While, the government is trying to find out a safe way for the mooring airships to mast. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame (@NUM1). The obstacles that the builders went through was if a big dirigible was to go on top of the building it was add stress by weighing it down. Also, it would get to the point where it would reach the frame of the building. They had to use a steel frame in order for things to work out. But, at the top of the building the winds cause violent shifting out to air currents. Having a dirigible dangling over pedestrians is very unsafe or even good. The builder of the Empire State building faced many significant challenges to allow the dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
6516	6	"The Empire State Building was always very famous and well-known, but did want more attention. Governor of New York, Al Smith, tried to allow dirigibles to dock on the building for transportation. He was encouraged it would work and actually went through with building it. The builders went through many obstacles trying to make it possible.To make this dream possible the builders would have to modify and strengthen the building. This would not be cheap, ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" It would be very expensive. The builders designed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower."" Also the mast would have four wings of all all corners. The builders designed observation areas and even elevators and baggage areas. They had it all planned out and raised an American flag at the top. Unfortunately, nobody considered all the dangers of docking dirigibles. All the builders work never went through. They tried to dock two but it did not work out. The building turned into the world's highest soda fountain and tea garden for sightseers."	1	2		1																					
6519	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the weight of the dirigible ""or blimp"", lust wind pressure, caused too much stress on the building's frame. The architects easily overcame this obstacle. They strengthened to iron frame of the building so it could withstand the added stress. Unfortunately, the other obstacles were not overcome, and led to the abandonment of the use of the mast for docking dirigibles. The biggest problem a safety. Many blimps used hydrogen rather than helium to keep it afloat, which is highly flammable. There was too much of a risk of the blimp catching fire and falling onto the city. Nature was also an enormous obstacle. Wind would blow the blimp into surrounding buildings, and since it was floating in the air, weights couldn't keep it down. Finally, there was an existing law stating aircraft could not fly too low around urban areas."	3	4		4

6523	6	"The Empire State Building started out as a huge sky-skraper. Then Al Smith had to get all competitive and put his crew to full work. The crew had many obsticles to fufil. First off, they had to modify and strengthen the building's steel frame, costing over sixty thousand dollars. Second the men made a shiny glass and chrome-nickle stainless steel tower, illuminated inside. next they had to add four wings or shiny aluminum to rise a conical roof for housing the mooring arm.  Fourth the crew has to add stairs and elevators to accomidate the ""blimps"" passengers.  And lastly they would add a couple of observation rooms to the @NUM1 and 102 floors.

This became an obstacle because the building had already been built, so they'd have to work around the existing foundation. Another obstacle that was faced was a law. The law stated ""no airships are allowed to fly low over urban areas."" This became an obstacle because they had to convince government people it was safe. Finally the greatest obstacle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This was an obstacle because winds could get so bad that the dirigible tied up could rip the roof off and hurt the people below. In conclusion, that is how the builders in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	4	3		4																					
6536	6	The builders of the Empire state Building faced numerous technical and safety problems in creating the building's dirigible mooring mast. First off, a dirigible moored to the mast by just one cable would put enormous stress to the frame of the building The building's frame had to be strengthened first to allow such a project. When the mast was finished, several other problems prevented its use. The mast was designed to make the building a center of travel, but most dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen to fly, instead of helium. Earlier, the German blimp Hindenburg had been destroyed because hydrogen was so flammable. It was realized that such a disaster would be much more catastrophic should it happen over a densely populated city like New York. Also, blimps moored to the mast would be blown around by violent winds, possibly pushing them into nearby buildings. The lead weights normally used to prevent this would have had to be left dangling over pedestrians, a major safety issue- @CAPS1, there was a law prohibiting dirigibles from flying too low over urban settlements, making use of the mast illegal. These problems doomed the mooring mast project from the start.	4	4		4																					
6539	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. A big problem with safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building would not work out due to the highly populated New York and dangling over pedestrians.Another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even aproach the area. Even if it could, there was worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings.	3	3		3																					
6540	6	"Architects and builders working on building a docking platform on top of the Empire State Building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. The first problem builders came across was the possibility that the building's framework was not potentially strong enough to support a dirigible's weight. It was said in paragraph nine that ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way down to the building's foundation, and that was too risky. Another obstacle that builder's came across ""was nature itself."" @CAPS1 some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, it was feared that the winds on top of the building would be too intensely violent and be destroyed by flammable gas. The next obstacle builders faced was public safety. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 dirigibles could not approach the dock over the area for sake of the citizens of New York. All of these problems eventually led to ""the idea of using the mooring mast [to be] shelved."""	3	3		3																					
6543	6	"The architects of the Empire State building faced several obstacles when constructing the mooring mast. One of which would be that the purpose which it was suppose to serve (docking dirigibles), the original design of the building could not handle it. In paragraph @NUM1, it says ""A thousand foot dirigibles would add stress to the buildings frame."" Because of this realization, they had to make ""sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications"" (paragraph @NUM1)Another obstacle they would have to face would be the additions of new floors. They originlly designed the building to be about @NUM3 floors, but with the addition of the mooring mast, the builders had to make an extra top and do it with such detail so that it could be both an observatory and a boarding dock.These first two obstacles, although they were difficult, nevertheless they were solvable. Some of the obstacles the builders had to face were not fixable. The first was that dirigible's from @LOCATION2 were filled with hydrogen (which is highly flamable). Due to the location of the Empire State building (downtown New York), a little accident could cause huge problems in the city. Also, thwy did not take in consideration the winds at the top of the building. The Empire State building would be at such a high altitude that there would be very high winds. These winds would cause for the dirigibles to be unstable which was also not safe. With these last two obstacles, the mooring mast was still built, but served as a design instead of a dock."	3	3		3																					
6544	6	"In the excerpt the obstacles the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the ""lack of a suitable landing area"". (p. @NUM1) @CAPS1 were trying to attempt a suitable landing area to allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and let passengers off and on. @CAPS1 try to attempt an electric winch. This ""would swing in the breeze and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking gangplank to an open observation platform."" The biggest obstacle, @CAPS1 of the Empire State building was to ""nature itself"" which meant that dirigibles moored in open landing fields, where they would be high above pedestrians on the street where it was neither practical nor safe. @CAPS1 of the Empire State attempted these causes to allow dirigibles to enter on the property of the Empire State Building!"	2	3		3

This shows that in order for the mast to even be built the structure of the entire building would need to be altered to accomidate the use of the mast. The second obstacle they faced, in the actual use of the mast, was nature. In hopes of docking the dirigibles to the mast, mother nature would not allow it, as it @CAPS1 in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" They also warned that with those air currents the passengers would not make it off of th dirigible safely due to the end of the dirigible floating rapidly undocked.

6549	6	"The builders faced several obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building, until finally they called it quits. According to the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Chrysler building in New York City was about to be the height of the not-built Empire state. The weight and strength of a dirigible could damage the entire building so it would have to be strengthened and modified in order for the blimp to be able to land. The engineers also had to find a way to control the flammability that dirigibles tend to have. In paragraph @NUM1, L�sted describes a dirigible that exploded in New Jersey not long ago, and that constructing a landing pad over the densely populated New York City, could be detrimental. The constructors of the mooring mast finally came to the conclusion that the plan was ""neither practical nor safe"" (@NUM2). The blimps are held down with lead weights and this could have a negative effect on pedestrians if something were to ever go wrong.

Since most of the dirigibles from outside U.S.A uses hydrogen rather than helium, hydrogen is much more flammable. This is a very dangerous obstacle to builders because fire itself is really dangerous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, however. If the winds are shifting violently, the dirigibles could be way down and be dangling high above the pedestrians. This would not be safe to the people or the builders because it could hurt them. Another obstacle builders would face is that there was a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. It would make illegal for a ship to ever tie up or get close to the area.

6562	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to consider the stress of the building, and adding more to the top of the building would increase the stress. The steel frame would have to be modified and strengthened to meet the needs. Also it would be over @MONEY1' worth of modifications. The builders also faced the obstacle of safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is flammable, so it wouldn't be safe. ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" There was also a law that was in their way. Facing all these obstacles, caused the builders to not go through with this idea."	3	3		3																					
6563	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main concern was the dirigibles themselves because they use hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable. If a dirigible were to explode above a densely populated area it would be desasterous. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the building's mooring mast was nature. A mooring mast is used for docking airships such as a dirigible or a zeppelin. With these large air crafts, docking them on top of a building where winds are violently shifting is very dangerous. the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast, posing as a @CAPS1 threat. Dirigibles moored in open land feilds where they could be weighed down with lead weights. With a dirigible moored over the Empire State Building, it would dangle high above pedestrians, this is neither @CAPS2 nor practicle. Constructing the Empire State Building had @CAPS3 more challenges and obsticles than its architects would have hoped for.	3	3		3																					
6564	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had various problems to @CAPS1 in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The nature of the ships, added stress to the building and safety were all against the ludicrous idea of landing blimps on the Empire State Building.The nature of the ships would cause the body to sway in the wind. One problem that comes from this is tangling the mooring cable. To combat this captains would have to use lead counterweights. These were highly impractical to use because they would hanging over crowded streets.Another problem was added stress to the buildings Foundation. Since the building was not ordinarily designed for this role, modifications would have to be made to its foundation. The cost of these renovations was over sixty thousand dollars.The most obvious problem was safety. These airships were filled with highly flammable hydrogen. The area surrounding the building had other buildings with sharp spires on top. If a ship hit one of these, there was no stopping the disaster.	3	3		3																					
6565	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles include the weather, safety, previous dirigible tragety, and the law.The wind at the top of the Empire State building was a huge safty hazard because even if the dirigible was secured the back would swing a cause a potential hazzard due to the unpredictable winds. To fly a dirigible they are filled with hydrogen instead of helium, this is also dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. On May, 6, 1937 the hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3, so the owners took into consideration this could have been much worse if the accident had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Dirigibles are very unsafe so this created many obsticles for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigible to dock there."	3	3		3																					
6567	6	In the excerpt there were multiple obstacles the builders faced when allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. First was making the steel frame of the building stronger. The builders also had to make the empire state building 102 stories tall, and make the 101st story an observatory. The last obstacle the faced was building the empire state building. Those are the obstacles that the builders faced when construction the empire state building.	1	1		1																					
6569	6	"Coming from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Empire State building was to be so much more. The hazards of the gases in some of the Dirigibles was a huge risk because some were flammable. Having the mooring mast in the huge city served potential threats to the safety of the city and population as well. As well is the safety threat; the winds were uncontrollable too. Because the mast would be so high up it was impossible to predict the ever-changing winds. With the winds, the dirigibles would not be able to stay in one place, which was another safety issue the architects had over looked. After all the safety issues and weather problems, there was still the fact that a law forbid the idea. Making the mast idea out of the question. With all the risky and dangerous tasks they would of had to dealt with, the mast was never built, and very unfortunate that after all the planning, there was absolutely no way the dirigibles could ever land there."	2	3		3

6572	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had great plans to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. Although they kept their expectations high, they faced many obstacles while trying to make this happen. The first problem they ran into was the fact that the steel frame of the building would have to be strengthened due to the stress of the dirigible's load. So, the architects had to make changes to the building's skeleton. Safety was also an issue because hydrogen made the blimps flammable, which could cause a destruction by fire. There was also an existing law stating ""airships can't fly to low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, dirigibles wouldn't be allowed to tie up to the building, let alone even reach that area. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Due to heavy winds, the dirigibles would swivel around too much, and the area was not open enough to weigh down the back with lead weights. So, the architects of the Empire State Building faced too many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to successfully dock there."	3	4		4																					
6574	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allowing dirgibles to dock there. One obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. The winds there were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it dangerous for a dirigible to stop there. Another obstacle was a law against flying dirigibles over cities. The law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Since they were banned from doing this, no pilot would ever more there. A third obstacle was the decreasing use of dirigibles.  With the Hindenburg incident on May 6, 1937 and the increasing use of airplanes, not many people few on airships anymore. In conclusion, several obstacles prevented the docking of dirgibles to the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
6576	6	In attempting to build a working mooring dock for dirigibles on the Empire State Building the works set themselves a hard task. First they had to make sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications so that the building would withstand the weight and added wind pressure of a moored dirigible. Also, a prexisting law made it immpossible for dirigibles to come as low to the city as they needed to be to dock. Finally constant changes in wind current and other weather made a safe docking at the Empire State Building nearly impossible because the dirigible might get blown into the sharp roofs of nearby buidings and instead of being weighted down by lead like they would when they landed in fields as they normally would, they would be tied up, dangling over pedestrians.	3	2		3																					
6577	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were comprehended to late. First they had to figure out a way to go about this, but they also needed government officials to agree that it's a safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to create something else for it to land on. But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add stress to the buildings frame"" and would be sent down all the way to it's foundation, which means they would have to modify their model of what the Empire State building was going to be. But one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable. And their are many people and other building in @CAPS1 that could be put in danger. Also the weather takes a toll on how the dirigibles going to act in the air, if it's rough it could cause major safety problems. There was and has been a law restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 much, this idea was over from the start, but no one took the time to realize."	2	4		3																					
6578	6	The obstacles of The @CAPS1 of Them Empire state building were some big ones which led to some Problems. for @CAPS2, There was a lack of a, Landing area for the Dirigible.

6579	6	"Based on the exerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is as follows. The first challenge was to find ""a practical, workable arrangement"" for the engineers to be able to work well and safely. Another problem the builders faced was how to put a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored"" into a building that was 1,046 feet tall. The main obsticle they faced was the fact that the dirigible moored ""would add stress to the building's frame"" which may cause it to fall due to its weight. For the builders to overcome the challenge, they would have to modify and give more strength to the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building."" @CAPS1, the builders went through a lot of obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building, but in the end it was all worth their hard work to make Al Smith keep his winning title."	2	2		2																					
6580	6	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. In paragraph @NUM1, the narrator says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This did not stop some dirigibles from attempting it, but it was too dangerous around other buildings. The next obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammible"". An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be devastating. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible. In light of all these issues, builders were forced to admit that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was indeed destined to fail."	3	2		3

In the excerpt from The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there are many challenges for the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to land dirigibles there. Some of the obstacles the builders faced included the enormous size of the dirigibles, the frame would need to be modified, the cost, and nature itself.landing the dirigibles would be a hard task. For one, the dirigibles are enormous, they are ""a thousand-foot"" long flying devices. This would make it extremely difficult to land just because of its weight. The stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way  to the building's foundation."" This is a struggle because the ""steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified."" This modification would take lots of effort and planning. Plus, modification also brings up the problem of cost. There would have to be ""over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications."" That cost is mindblowing and would create challenges of how to get that money. In addition nature itself was an obstacle. Winds at the top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Nature would bring up many challenges for the builders to have to work around. Overall, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3		4																					
6590	6	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was making the mooring mast. this was a problem because it whould add alot of stress to the building, And safety was an issue. I said that the law restricted this Because you can't Put a Blimp over urban areas because if some thing goes wrong alot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task it was very hard to make it to support a Blimp Because there will be to much pressure on the building. lastly safety there were Blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with. If that were to happen in New York alot of innocent lives will be gone.	3	3		3																					
6591	6	"The builders faced many different obstacles in their attempt to allowing Blimps to dock there. There were two major obstacles. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly @CAPS1"" (@NUM1). If a blimp had an accident like the Hindenburg, not only would the Empire State building go down, it would affect other buildings and people too because of the city's population. Lastly the other large effect on the building was the weather. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2). The winds could have easily knock it over with a blimp attatched to it for this reason: ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2). As result to this the blimb would be so close to the mast that if a strong enoungh wind was blowing, the blimps weight you take the mast with it. All in all weather and hydrogen blimps with the builders' two major obstacles."	3	3		3																					
6592	6	"Al Smith's plan to add two hundred and fifty feet of height onto the Empire State Building by attaching a resting stop for traveling blimps was plaussible in theory, but as it was put in motion the workers had to face multiple obstacles that ultimately made the attempt unsuccessful. The easiest and the only fixable obstacle was the issue of the added stress the blimp put on the building's frame. The whole building had to be strengthed to adjust to the pressure, but the workers eventually got the construction done. However, the biggest thing that hindered the mooring mast from being successful was nature itself. The winds that high in the air were constantly shifting violently, so even if the dirigible had been attached to the mast, the back of it would swivel around uncontrollably. Unfortunately because they would have landed high in the air, using lead weights the control the back of the aircraft was impractical. The prevention of natures problems is not possible, and similarly nothing could have been done to fix the issue of unsafety. Most blimps outside of the @LOCATION2 used a more flammable gas inside of them, and landing a dirigible that could catch on fire high above New York City was an extremely dangerous idea. There was nothing the workers could have done to solve other countrie's blimp composition. Finally, if nothing else, there were solid laws that made it illegal to ever have anything tied up so low over and urban area. Obviously, this obstacle couldn't have been overcome without waiting years and a lot of legal business. Placing the mooring mast on the Empire State Building with hope to land dirigibles seemed good, but during the actual process many obstacles were presented, most of which had no solution. In the end, the hope to ""equipp [the building] for an age of transportation,"" had to be given up."	4	4		4																					
6595	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that the most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and the hydrogen is highly flammable. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area, for example downtown New York. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship with swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.	4	3		4

Another obstacle was that the air currents were very rough at the top of the Empire State building. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring asked, the back of the ship which swivel around and around the mooring mast.""

In conclusion I have showend the obstacles that the builders have faced on the @ORGANIZATION1."	2	2		2																					
6601	6	"There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (@NUM1) This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM2) The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hyrogen is a very combustible gas and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed."	3	3		3																					
6602	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow blimps to dock there was the height of the building. For instance in paragraph @NUM1 it states ""the steel frame of the building would have to be modified, over six thousand dollars worth of modifications"" This proves that the height of the empire was its height because the city had to pay modification fees. Also, because the building is so tall the mast is not that stable so that was the main obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM2 ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" This demonstrates that mast in those currents and not being stable enough could be very dangerous for downtown New York. Lastly, even state laws became an obstacle for the dirigibles such as in paragraph @NUM3 it states ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building"" This justifies that this was also an obstacle that the builders faced"	3	3		3																					
6603	6	The obstacles the builders had to face were very big obstacles. One of them being the Mooring Mast it's self. The building which wasn't strong enough to hold an airship with it's original design. So the building had to be Modified and Strengthened to accommodate this situation. They would add a rocket shaped tower built out shiny glass and chrome-nickel Stainless steel. This tower would illuminate from the inside. Which would bump the building from @NUM1 floors to 102 floors . I got all this information from paragraphs @NUM2.	1	2		2																					
6604	6	"Based on the excerpt some obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included the laws @CAPS1 plane height, the fact that some dirigibles used hydrogen fuel instead of helium, and lastly at such great heights the strong wind currents were a problem as well. The restriction of plane height was that plaes could not fly to low above cities without being a safety hazard. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". (The MOORING MAST). Another obstacle related to the fact that some outside the U.S dirigibles used hydrogen fuel in place of helium which could cause a problem because hydrogen is highly flammable. ""From outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium"". (The Mooring Mast). Lastly, strong winds were an obstacle as well, the high wind currents would blow the dirigibles all around as the attempted to dock at the Empire State Building which would pose as a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". (The Mooring Mast). In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	4		4																					
6606	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The challenges ranged from nature itself to laws against it. They didn't take into consideration the constantly shifting air atop the building. At such heights as the moring mast violent air currents would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. This was also due to the fact that the blimp would only be tethered in the front. Not only were those large factors coming into play but laws also came in the way of dirigibles mooring at the Empire State. They didn't think about the existing law. It stated that air ships flying to low or over urban areas was against the law. So many factors came into play with building such a project. Overall it was too far fetch of an idea.	2	3		3																					
6608	6	"Based on the excerpt 'The Mooring Mast' by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there are many varied obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One main reason would be the safety issues of the dirigible. Most dirigibles used hydrogen to be lighter than air. Hydrogen is a very flammable gas that could easily catch fire, just like the Hindenburg. If an accident like the Hindenburg were to happen over downtown New York, the outcome would not be good. Also dirigibles moored in open fields and would need to be anchored with big lead weights. These weights would niether be practical nor safe dangling above people and a small moring on the top of a building is no open field. One last obstacle is the sixty thousand dollars needed to just make the frame suitable for mooring dirigibles. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" With out a doubt, just to make a mooring for dirigibles at the top of the tallest building in the world would come with many different obstacles the builders would have to face."	3	4		4																					
6609	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there. First the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose because the builders didn't notice all the problems it had. One attempt was the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building, as stated in paragraph @NUM1. In paragraph @NUM2 it states that the greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. The builders had a lot of work to do to actually try and fix the problems but there was just to many. In conclusion the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacle attempts to allow dirigible to dock there.	1	1		1

""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (� @NUM2). This would have been very dangerous. A third obstacle was the law, which was impossible to get around. There ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (� @NUM3).

One problem is that there was no easy way to make such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while making it look good.  The other, most main reason/problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was just a safety issue.  But a big one.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is extremely flammable.  So, if something were to go wrong with docking the dirigible could catch fire and explode & go down in a densely populated area.  There were a lot of safety and structure issues but they were eventually resolved, (like the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible	1	2		2																					
6618	6	Trying to construct the Empire State Building in a way to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the building, brought up many challenges for the builders. There was a huge saftey issue having the blimps so close to the city. In paragraph @NUM1, the fear of winds that could blow the blimp into other buildings, wrecking them, scared people. The second concern was the fact that the blimp is full of highly flamable gas and if they blimp was ever to burst into flames above a city, much damage would be done to the blimp and New York City. The last major concern is located in paragraph nine. The problem would be the amount of stress the building would take on by having a blimp tied to the top of it. The whole building would have to be reconstructed to help the Empire State Building not take on that stress; In fact, basically every part of the building and blimp would have to be remodeled in order to keep New York City, and the passengers of the dirigible safe.	3	3		3

One obstacle was that the dirigible would add too much stress to the frame of the building if it landed there.

Since New York is highly populated, if something were to go wrong, it would be unsafe. Also, the winds at the top of the building were very strong. The back of the dirigible would be ""swivelling around the mooring mast.""The last obstacle would be that it is ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up or approach of building.""

The initial problem was that the blimp couldn't land on a flat surface. So the builders made a ""mooring mast"" so blimps could be connected by electrical winch to the building. But this caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building or it would be unstable. But most importantly since the winds kept changing it would never stay still. The problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium made it to dangerouse to the public.

6628	6	the builders of the Empire State Building bit off more than they could chew when constructing a mooring mast there. The first of several problems was that the presence of a thousand-foot long Dirigible would a tremendous amount of stress to the frame of the building, and @MONEY1 of modifications would have to be added. Safety was another pressing issue. In 1937, the crash of the hindenburg made the owners of the building realize how bad it would be if a zeppelin crashed over densely-populated New York. Not only was there an existing law that forbid airships to fly too low over urban areas. the factor of nature made the mooring mast Idea completely @CAPS1. Winds on top of the building are always shifting due to Violent air currents, even the capitain of the U.S. Navy ship Los Angeles could not land the dirigible. At this point It was apparent that the mooring mast idea would not work. And dirigibles were abandoned when airplanes, the method of aviation of the future, had arrived.	4	3		4

The first obstacle was modifying the frame of the building to acommodate for the stress that the mooring mast would put on the building. The load of the dirigible and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building which was eleven-hundred feet below. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made in altering the frame of the building. It was costly. Another obstacle the builders face was the gas used inside the dirigible, hydrogen. Most dirigibles outside of the United States use hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flammable and if a dirigible were to go up in flames above such a densely populated area such as downtown New York the results of the accident would be catastrophic. Nature was also another obstacle itself. The winds at the top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. The dirigible would be swiveling around and around the mast. While lead weights were used in open landing fields, this was impractical to do above pedestrians on the street. Above all else an existing law prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a dirigible to even approach the mast. These obstacles had made it impractical for a dirigible to ever dock on the mooring mast of the Empire State Building.	4	4		4																					
6630	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The hydrogen in the dirigibles was highly flammable, winds shifted a lot, and existing laws made it illegal to dock in such an area. Most dirigibles during that time. Were floating by hydrogen rather than helium. With the builders found out was hydrogen is very flammable and too risky to land dirigibles that could catch on fire above a whole city. The excerpt also explained that nature was a huge issue. Air currents as high as those a top the buildings were vicious and shifted rapidly which would make it dangling dirigibles from that high up very risky. Lastly, was the obstacle of breaking the law! The law against airships flying to low over urban areas. With all these obstacles that would be too difficult for the builders face, this unreal dream would yet remain a dream.	3	3		3																					
6631	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. One problem was designing the building to be able to withstand the stress from a thousand-foot dirigible swinging around it in the wind. The builders needed to find a way to distribute the wind pressure all the way to the foundation. Another problem was the strong winds surrounding the building; when the navy tried to dock a dirigible on it, it kept being tossed about by the strong winds, this problem was never solved. A third problem was finding a way to actually dock the dirigible, this was quickly solved with a winch. A final problem was the fact that the dirigibles were so dangerous, and couldnt safly dock, as well as a law that prevented dirigibles from flying close to buildings, which was created for that reason.	3	3		3																					
6633	6	"In The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, two architects play ""battleship"" with each of their dirigibles, competing for most height. However, when building these ""enormously steel-framed balloons"", the architects didn't realize the obstacles that they would have to face during this process. The biggest reason was for safety precautions. Since most dirigibles were made of hydrogen, they were highly flammable. This, they said, could have been worse than the German Hindenburg, which was demolished by fire in New Jersey in 1937. However, the best obstacle to use of the mast was nature. The winds caused the mast's to be clanging above human beings, which was not practical or safe."	2	2		2																					
6635	6	The builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first major problem was they weren't sure if the structure of the building could hold up to a swaying dirigible. As said in paragraph @NUM1. Also the builders knew that since the dirigible would be hooked to the mast by a single cable, the air currents would make the back of the ship swivel around the mooring mast. As said in paragraph @NUM2.  There also was a law enforcement against airships flying too lower over urban areas. That would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building. Those are some of the obstacles that the builders were faced with	2	3		3																					
6636	6	The Empire State Building was designed to be the tallest building in the World. Al Smith's plans were to make it taller than the new Chrysler Building, but when a @NUM1-foot tall spire was added to the top, the Empire State Building was going to come in second. To overcome this first obstace in building the tower, Smith decided to change the idea for the tower and add his own spire: a mooring mast for dirigibles. Using the tower as an anchor for dirigible balloons, or zeppelins, Smith added another 250 feet to the tower. But to continue with the plan, Smith had to face the obstacle of supporting a floating blimp more than @NUM2 feet above the ground. Smith had the entire building frame modified and strengthened before the building was finished. Smith's final obstacle was one he couldn't control: the weather. The winds at the top of the building were too harsh, so the dirigible idea was scrapped, but Al Smith's tower had made it to the world's tallest building.	2	2		2																					
6637	6	"Throughout the process of construction the Empire State Building contractors faced couple of obstacles in their quest to dock dirigibles on it. First off, safety was a huge factor of the quest. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 a baloon and dirigible may have the same appearance the two are completely structured differently. Helium causes a balloon to rise a dirigible uses hydrogen to fly which is highly flamable. Secondly there was already a law put into effect for air trafficking. ""... could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing the wind would blow the dirigibles onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the shell."" If the dirigible was to ever get punctured it could collaps into the streets of New York causing mass destruction. Thus concluding a few of many obstacles in the way of landing dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	2	3		3																					
6638	6	The emire state building faced alot of obstacles and challenges while it was being built. The builders built a rocket shaped mast so the dirigible could be housed in the shaft itself. Which also had elevators so people could go down to the lobby. The building would now be 102 floors. The glassed observation room would be on the 101st floor.	0	0		0																					
6640	6	"The mooring mast seems like a great idea. A landing dock for dirigibles would have jumped travel into the future. As it turns out, however, architect Al Smith bit off more than he could chew. First of all, the fate of the Hindenburg put worry over the owners heads. ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that (Hindenburg) accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". The second problem is that there is an existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""This law would make it illegal for the ship to tie up to the building or even approch the area"", The final and most problematic part of the mooring mast was actually revealed to be nature itself. As it turns out, the wind on top of the building were too violent and unpredictable. Even if the dirigible was tethered, ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". Overall, it seems like this was a great idea gone bad."	3	3		3																					
6641	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had hopes of making this building a dock for dirigibles but were faced with several obstacles. Starting in paragraph @NUM1 the aspiration of the mast on the Empire State Building made the plan seem well put together and it would soon become a reality. As the project progressed many details went looked over and when the dirigibles were ready to take action the plan was not something forageable. Stated in paragraph @NUM2, safety was a huge issue for the dirigibles made outside of the United States, because they contained the flamable gas hydrogen. This is a problem because of the fear of an accident occuring in a  highly populated area. Another obsticle dirigibles faced while trying to have a dock on the Empire State Building was nature itself as presented in paragraph @NUM3. The winds on the top of the building had violent currents that were constantly shifting. The problem with the air would have the dirigibles constantly spinning around the building by its back end. This made it unsafe for passengers to get on and of and also the cargo. The greatest obstacle for dirigibles trying to dock on the Empire State Building is the existing law against flying too low over urban areas, which is found in paragraph @NUM4. By a dirigible docking it would be directly breaking the law.	3	4		4																					
6643	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted,to obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock where nature and the law against airships flying too low over urban areas.     The greatest obstacle builders faced was nature. ""The winds of the top of the building constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Also the back of the ships would force the dirigible to spin around from the forceful winds. Then using lead weights in the Empire State Building, they would be dangling high above people on the streets below and it is not safe.      The next obstacle is that a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made dirigibles illegal to fly over to the building."	2	2		2																					
6645	6	There are many obstacles the builders had to face while attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles. One obstacle they had to overcome was paying over sixty thousand dollars' to the worth of modifications for the building's framework. In paragraph @NUM1, it stated that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load, and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly hundred feet below. As a result of this issue, the frame of the entire building had to change to accommodate the new situation. More obstacles flooded in after the new modifications. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had to have a skeleton of steel, stated in paragraph @NUM2,	2	2		2																					
6646	6	It is clear that there were problems in trying to dock dirigibles on the Empire state Building. The first reason's that, the law against flying airships to low over the Empire State Building made it hard to do so. Next is that the thoughtes in being unsafe because some dirigibles use hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is flammable A big reason is when the german dirigible got destryed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building then realized how much more worse the accident could have been if it had happened on such a densely populated area suched as downtown New York City. The last reason was the thought that they would use lead weights to hold the dirigibles down, but they realized that it wasn't practical nor was it safe. It was clear that there were problems in the docking of dirigibles on the Empire State building; but it is probably a much safer choice for both the residents/citizens of New York and all of the people who ever work(ed) on it such as architects, engineers and the aviation pioners.	3	3		3																					
6648	6	"Acording to the excerpt from The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced obsticles in attempting to attache a dirigible mooring unit to the top of the building. In paragraph @NUM1, @CAPS1 says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" and Then describes how harsh winds could render the mast unstable. Another obsticle in the making of the mast was a law stating derigibles could not fly under a certain altitude, The set altitude was higher then the building was tall. The last obsticle was safety, in paragraph @NUM2 @CAPS1 talks about how some blimps are filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. The effect of a blimp fire over a vastly populated area would be devistating. The mooring mast on the Empire State building was an ingeniose idea, but had to many obsticles to make it work."	3	3		3																					
6649	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was one of safety. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above the densely populated areas such as downtown New York.    The greatest obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights.       The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.	4	3		4																					
6650	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. There were two main ones: Safety and Nature.The builders should have realized that the idea wasn't safe, before building. Most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which was highly flammable. An accident over densely populated New York would be bad.The biggest obstacle was nature. There were violent air currents that caused constantly shifting winds at the top of the building. This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast.There was also an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This means it would be illegal to tie a dirigible up to the building, anyway.	3	3		3																					
6651	6	"In the excerpt ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles. Their goal was to build a moor on top of the building in order for dirigibles, or blimps, to dock. In the end they were not successful. One obstacle was ""lack of a suitable landing area."" Without this, the dock would not work. Another main obstacle is the safety reason. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly fammable."" They could easily catch on fire and harm many innocent people. Which leads to two other reasons. ""Nature itself."" That could easily start a fire with the wind. ""Existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The dirigibles could harm innocent people. Many other obstacles were found so this plan failed."	3	4		4																					
6653	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced many problems when tempting to let dirigbles dock there. There were @NUM1 major problems of why it was so hard to dock them at the Empire State building. These obstacles were what was in the dirigbles, the ""nature"" of winds around New York, and a new law passed on restrictions of airships.     Dirigbles unlike balloons, which are made up of Helium, dirigbles are made up of hydrogen. Hydrogen is highly flamible. This coud have resulted in terrible way if anything caught on fire since New York is so highly densed.     Another problem they faced were the high winds of New York. They were constantly shifting, so they thought to tie the dirigibles down with lead but this would be a bad idea because if the lead ever fell it would injure many people.     Lastly, they recently passed a law against airships flying too low over urban cities. If this law was very strict than the dirigibles wouldnt be allowed to dock there because it might be too close to the city.     In, conclusion there were many obstacles that the archtects dont think about before constructing."	4	3		4																					
6654	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow diigibles to dock there. The builders were in a compition to become the tallest building in the world. This made them rush and really @CAPS1 for this. The archetes had to find a way to build this mast. ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modification had to be made to the building's framework"".

6657	6	"As a result of the idea to build a mooring mast, the builder faced a few obstacles in construction the mast. The first problem was structural, the weight of the dirigible tied it with a single tie would put great stress on the building. It was said between the dirigible's load and wind pressure the stress would be distributed all the way to foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the safety. Many dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium which is highly flamable. The owners realized the ""Hindenburg"" incident and realized the effects it could of had on downtown New York. The final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted at the top of the building. The problem discussed on this was despite the dirigibles being tied, it could swivel around the mast. The many obstacles faced led to the mooring mast not being constructed to its full purpose and blimps were less commodly used."	3	3		3																					
6662	6	"In ""The mooring mast"" by Marcia lusted builders who tried to make it possible for dirigibles or ""blimps"" to tie up to the mooring mast of the Empire State Building faced some problems they didn't account for. These were variations of blimps they didn't plan for, safety issues and also laws they would have to violate to have a dirigible land. The builders when making the mast didn't think deeply about any of these things.The problems the builders would face would appear right after the mast went up. To start the differences in blimps between countries was a factor, because blimps in the @LOCATION2 used helium to keep the dirigible flying but in places outside the states they used hydrogen which is flammable. This is a major issue for a place like New York that is densely populated. Another safety issue that they can't control was nature, the high winds atop the building would move the back of the blimp around and also when landing the window may push the blimp into the mast which would puncture the dome. Both these safety reasons were why blimps are landed on the ground. However even without both of these reasons there was a legal issue, a law that stated that airships can't fly too low over urban areas. This would make it illegal to dock on the building.Having not considered all these things the builders put up the mast but unfortunately they would later have to face the differences in blimps, safety issues and legal troubles they didn't account for."	3	4		4																					
6663	6	The Empire State building was built to compete with the Chrysler building and to compete they created a mooring mast. The obstacles that restricted the dirigibles was: nature, the wind changes on top of the building were drastic, and some dirigibles had a large amount of hydrogen which is highly flammable. Another reason why was because it's illegal for aircrafts to fly low over urban areas. The examples above were all complications that restricted the derigibles to moor at the Empire State building.	2	2		2																					
6664	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the challenges of creating a Mooring mast on top of a 1,250 foot tall building are discusted. In the @DATE1's Al Smith, the govener at the time had the idea of makeng the empire state building equipted with its own landing dock for Dirigibles. Throughout the process the builders were faced with many obstacles in there attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. The first obstacle was getting the mast on top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). If the builders did do that it would cause too much stress to the building. The problem was solved after spending over @MONEY1 on a steal frame to support the mast.However, most of the builders problems were not able to be solved. Safety was a major issue, most dirigibles were built with hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamible. It would be a huge problem if a fire occured over a densely populated area. Also the dirigibles would be too high up to be tied down. Also if the dirigibles did land there it would in violation of an existing law. Therefore the builders were faced with so many obsticles they were unable to build the mast."	3	4		4																					
6665	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there. One major obstacle was safety, mainly because when foreign dirigibles flew in, they most likely contained hydrogen (highly flammable). After the Hindenburg crash they were more wary if something like that happened in a densely populated area. An unstoppable obstacle to the builders was nature; with the vicious winds getting tied up in releasing passengers would be hard enough. According to the article lead weights were used to land dirigibles in open land on crappy weather, but the builders didn't use them, so there was no chance of it falling and hitting someone. Through all this trouble the builders still had the most practical problem; ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With this issue it was illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building so close to the ground. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never worked out as planned, the builders went through looking at obstacles just for the thought."	3	3		3																					
6666	6	"The competitive spirit of Al Smith, governor of New York, drove him and his architects to build a docking site for dirigibles atop the Empire State Building. Instead of seeing the daunting task which lay ahead, they saw the opportunity to become the epitome of modern travel. When deciding to build a mooring on top of the Empire State Building, the architects knew they'd face multiple obstacles. The first obstacle they faced with how to adjust the frame of the building to support the docking site. The architects knew that the building ""would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (par. @NUM1). They were able to overcome this obstacle but many more loomed up ahead. The wind and weather needed to be taken into consideration as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" (par. @NUM2). Reluctantly the builders admitted to the inevitable obstacle posed by nature. The builders seems to realize how unrealistic this dream was. Two more obstacles lay ahead, and these would lay the mooring dock to rest forever. A floating dirigible above a densley populated city was an all around dangerous idea. It was noticed that hydrogen was highly flammable (par. @NUM3) and a fire would be detrimental to both the building and the city. The last obstacle they faced was the law, and they were unable to conquer this. They realized that there ""was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (par @NUM4). The impossibility of the plan was realized for there were too many obstacles to face. The builders gave up hope but the moorings still looms atop the Empire State Building as a reminder of what could have been."	3	4		4																					
6673	6	some of the obstacles that the builders faced while allowing dirigibles to dock there would be that they had a lack of suitable landing area. one of the main obstacles that occurred would be nature. the shifting of the Air Currents were constanily shifting. the back of the ship was constanily shifting.	2	2		2																					
6675	6	"In The Mooring Mask by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State building faced Problems trying to dock the dirigibles.

If a dirigible had caught on fire while docked in such a highly populated area many people could have been killed. Another issue was nature, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around, making it unsafe. The builders faced many obstacles and unfortunately could never dock a dirigible at the Empire State building"	3	3		3																					
6677	6	There are many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. one issue was the stress the dirigible would add to the building. over sixty thousand dollars modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also, most dirigibles contained hydrogen which is highly flammable and dangerouss. Another dangerous aspect is that this huge piece of material would be dangling high above pedestrians, as opposed to there much safer usual landing of open fields. Lastly, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas, which would also cause docking issues.	3	3		3																					
6679	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because of ""nature itself"" and the past problems that happened.An obstacle that the builders faced was providing safety.

Because of the mooring mast being on top of the building, the builders were frightened because of the violent air currents.The last obstacle was that it was a law that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. So it was illegal for an airship to be tied on a building.The builders faced three main obstacles - ""Nature itself,"" a past accident, and the law. Unfortunetly, they were unable to continue their work because the obstacles were just too strong."	3	3		3																					
6680	6	"Allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building would have been completely different from anything before, but never continued because of obstacles. The builders faced issues such as safety issues, harnessing nature, and the law itself. The dirigibles presented safety issues including fire, which occurred and builders ""realized how much worse that accident could have been"" (� @NUM1) Another safety issue was keeping the blimps stabilized, which would have needed free hanging weights over the city. Yet another obstacle was the power of nature; it would have been nearly impossible to keep the dirigible in place. Because of the wind ""the back of the ship would swivel around... the mooring mast"" (� @NUM2). The new idea was a good one but the law also was against it, because of how low the blimp would be. As stated, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building..."" (� @NUM3). The masting moor of the Empire State Building caused too many obstacles for the project to be completed. Although it would have opened new doors for means of travel there were too many safety violation for it to be worth while."	4	3		4																					
6681	6	"While attempting to build a mooring dock on top of the Empire State building, the builders had some problems to overcome. The winds in New York City were too strong to fly a dirigible in, one driver said ""the captain could not take his hands off the control levers."" @CAPS1 so close to buildings in a dirigible was illegal for fear of crashing into ""sharp spires of other buildings in the area."" The only way to prevent the dirigible from swinging violently was to put large lead weights on it, but that would not be practical over New York.

6682	6	The builders had many obstacles while building the Empire State building. They had competition with the Chrysler building because of it's height. Al Smith, the constructor of the Empire State wanted to build the tallet and most famous building in the world. He made the buildings seem invincable. He even put a mooring mast on it so things could land on it. But it was never suppost to surve that purpouse, It was only created for publicity. Because about the mooring mast the building would have failed to become popular. Al Smith did everything to make that building what it is today and it is still standing in New York city today.	0	0		0																					
6685	6	"The Empire State Building at the time it was being built was designed to be the tallest building in the world. However this was not an easy task. The workers had one especially difficult obstacle overcome, @CAPS1 dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. The plan was to build a mooring mast on top of the building which would allow dirigibles to dock. If this could be achieved it was said to make the Empire State Building, ""equipped for an age of transportation..."" However many problems occurred. The dirigibles weight would have to be able to be held safely. The architects knew the weight would put stress on the buildings frame. The workers had to modify and strengthen the buildings framework. The workers also built the mast out of a strong, shiny, chrome-nickel. Another obstacle was faced when the mast was taken in consideration. The framework was originally stopped at the eighty-fifth floor. The workers had to finish the roof before the mast could be framed. Although the workers succeeded on making a safe mast, the ""Aviation Pioneers Dream"" never came to be."	2	3		3																					
6687	6	"Due to Several factors the Empire State Building faced many obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.

In paragraph nine it says ""the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the framework.""Another complication was nature itself. Above the city were strong winds which were constantly shifting due to air currents. This made it impossible to dock. As well as nature working against the mooring mast so was the law. In paragraph fifteen it says ""on existing law against airships flying too low over low urban areas."" Which made it illegal for an airship to ever tie up the the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
6690	6	When the Empire State Building was built, new ideas came into the heads of the architects. Unfortunately, the vision that they had of making it into @NUM1 dock for limps proved to be unrealistic.The first challenge that they came across was how to attach a dock for a blimp to the building without creating such stress to the building's framework. The building could potentially collapse with the added weight unless sixty thousand dollars' worth of framework strengthening was made.Another obstacle that the architects faced was nature. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were so strong that the blimps would be swaying too violently to allow for the pilots to dock them safely. The last reason that blimps could not be docked at the Empire State Building was that there were laws against aircraft's flying that low. It was actually consitered illigal to dock the blimp there because it would have to be flying low enough to approach the building. Due to these factors, the Empire State Building was unable to become a dock to support blimps.	3	3		3

They didn't just have to deal with man made @CAPS2, but nature's @CAPS2 as well. The wind on the top of the building made it nearly impassible to land safely. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).

6697	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the building. The first obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified. The excerpt says, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another obstacle was safety. After the German dirigible Hindenburg caught on fire, builders realized how bad the devastation would be if that happened over densely populated New York City. Nature was also a large obstacle. Shifting air currents at the top of the building would make the dirigible very unstable. It would be dangerous to have an unstable dirigible hanging above crowded city streets. Finally, at the time there was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" These obstacles are were the architects of the Empire State Building from attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	4	3		4																					
6698	6	Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One problem was that a large dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by one single cable tether would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the dirigible and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted almost eleven hundred feet below, to the building's foundation. This in turn means that the builders would have to go back and modify the frame of the Empire State Building in order for it to be strong enough to accommodate the dirigibles. Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications would have to be made. As construction proceeded, once the framing had been complete up to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place.	3	3		3																					
6704	6	The obstacles that the Empire State Building faced were alot. So that the dirigibles; blimps could dock there.One obstacle was building more floors. They had to build more floors so that the people on the dirigibles could have somewere to load and unload on the ship.Another obstacle was building steel frames from the 85th floor to the 102nd floor. This costed them over @MONEY1 worth of modifications, that had to be done to the buildings framework	1	1		1																					
6707	6	"In this fascinating story ""The Mooring Mast"" written by author Marcia Amidon L�sted tell about the Empire State building, & it's enormousity. Although constructing this building took workers time and strength they didn't exactly get the purpose of the mooring mast. There were many reasons why they faced conflicts in attempting to let the dirigibles dock in the mooring mast. For example the dirigible was made up of helium rather than hydrogen, & hydrogen is highly flammable, so if they were to dock in downtown New York City it would have been a complete tragedy. Another reason is because dirigibles were moored in open landing fields, so it could weighted down. Author Marcia writes ""but using these at the empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the streets was neither practical nor safe."" That's how & there's many more reasons why workers have trouble building the mooring mast."	3	2		3																					
6708	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Empire State Building faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin with, one of the greatest obstacle was the act of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", this made it hard for the dirigible to have a safer landing. The other obstacle was that there was a law, that went against airships flying low over urban areas. In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was not use for landing airship such as the dirigible because it was to dangireous. In addition, they used the mooring mast for other safe purpuses."	2	2		2																					
6709	6	In the beginning the use of dirigibles seemed like a good idea. They could be the new form of transportation and appeared to have no flaws. As the development of dirigibles progressed it showed signs of problems. The engineers planned on mooring the dirigible to the mast of the Empire State Building, but that would have added a lot of stress to the building's frame. They next found that safety was an issue. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium which was flamable. Also they would have to use lead weights to hold down the dirigible when it was being moored. It would be very dangerous to have lead weights dangling over pedestrians on the street. With out the lead weights the dirigible would simply swivel in the air with a possibility of puncturing its shell. Finally there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the ship to even approach the building. There was high hopes for the use of dirigibles, but in the end they had more cons then pros.	3	3		3																					
6710	6	"In an attempt to build a dirigble destination, in the Empire State Building, the architects had to deal with @CAPS3 problems like a dirigble mishap or simply nature itself.@CAPS3 problems like a blimp crash would be costly, lives would be lost in the densely populated city and the explosion could destroy buildings around and to the Empire State Building itself. To prevent this from happening the Government had already made a law that banned flying aircraft from going to close to urban areas. To build this @CAPS1 the architects would have to break laws or bend rules. Another conflicting idea, that disrupted, plans for a dirigble docking station would be nature, harsh winds could easily sway a blimp, and swaying could cause the blimp to punture on a nearby building, ""Even if the dirigble were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would still swivel around the mooring mast.""

6714	6	"Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were high wind currents, and an already existing law that was against airships flying too low over urban areas.The first reason dirigibles couldn't dock was because of overly powered wind currents on top of the Empire State Building. It was mentioned in paragraph @NUM1 that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" @CAPS1 was being said here was that it would be unsafe for people if the dirigibles were going to dock near the Empire State during violent air currents.The other reason why dirigibles couldn't dock was because of the law saying they were against airships flying to low over urban areas. @CAPS1 this law made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building and even get to close to the area. It was said in paragraph @NUM2 that dirigibles did try to reach the building."" In December 1930 the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area which would puncture the dirigible's shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Since the dirigible was @CAPS1 big it couldn't get close enough because of sharp objects on other buildings.It is clear that the builders of the Empire State Building went through challenging obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. All because of very violent wind or air currents and the already existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas."	3	3		3																					
6716	6	"After planning and building the mooring mast on top of the empire state building, the developers found many problems that were not thought of earlier. They hadn't thought about the flammability of the gases inside of the dirigibles. Nor had they remembered the ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to a building"" (lines @NUM1). Also, the heavy winds that would be found that high above the ground would certainly prove to be a danger to all the airships. If they had hit a neiboring building the results could be disastrous."	2	3		3																					
6718	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders went through obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock in the @ORGANIZATION1, the builders had to redesign the top of the Empire State Building. They had to make it taller and more suitable for the dirigibles to land. They went through problems because they were not sure if the dirigibles would fit. Second, the had to design the mast. The builders had to design a whole other part for the dirigible. The builders also had to spend sixty thousand dollars into building the mast. The builders faced that big obstacle. Third, the builders also made a stainless steel tower for the docking of the dirigibles. This was an obstacle because the had glass and chrome-nickel stainless steal on the tower. The builders went through many obstacles for the dirigibles to dock, when in the end the dirigibles never did get a chance to dock The builders should ""Take a bow, because it's over now"""	2	2		2																					
6719	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles and allowing dirigibles to dock there like safety, nature, and existing law.  In the excerpt the author tells how many dirigibles use hydrogen which is very flammable.  That makes it very dangerous to dock them on the Empire State Building because they could get in an accident, and since New York is so densely populated it would probably harm many people.  People's lives shouldn't be risked just to land a dirigible.  Another problem builders face was nature.  In paragraph @NUM1 the excerpt states ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""  This would mean the dirigible would just be dangling way above New York and winds could get dangerous very fast because it was so unpredictable.  According to the excerpt this was neither practical nor safe.  To add to all of these obstacles builders didn't consider an already existing law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas.  So that meant it would be illegal to dock a dirigible on the Empire State Building.  Builders faced so many obstacles about allowing derigibles to dock on the Empire State Building it just wasn't meant to be."	4	4		4																					
6721	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, nature, unsafe docking conditions and pre-existing laws against dirigibles were just a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The main obstacle ""to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". On the top of a building so high the wind is always switching directions which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"". Blimps or dirigibles always landed in open fields and could be weighted down with lead weights, but using this technique ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe"". The builders of the Empire State Building also came across ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". Now this law made it illegal for any airship to dock or tie up to the building. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was neither safe, practical or legal."	3	3		3																					
6723	6	"The future of transportation is a matter that any architect has discussed at one point. Whether reality is taken into account, that is another subject. Al Smith had the challenge of make the dream of docking dirigibles, into a reality. Although Smith had high hopes for the project, many obstacles stood in the way of the construction of the dock. One problem is stated in paragraph fourteen, ""the greatest obstacle to a sucsesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind power was not taken into account at the time, and neither was the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York are put in danger. In conclusion, dirigibles soon became much more useless with the spark of the airplane and soon died along with the dreams of the mooring mast.Another problem that stood in the way was a law stating, that airships cannot fly to close to urban areas. This destroyed any plans of the mast because not only was it risky to build, but it was also illegal. What was once a glimphs of the future soon turned into nothing as @PERSON1 finally confronted the public in saying that the construction will be post-poned. The future of transportation took a sharp blow, but with the new succession of the airplane, anything seemed possible."	3	2		3																					
6724	6	The Empire State Building was in construction the building passed for many obstacles. First, because they wanted to do the biggest build in the world and they had to work hard.

6725	6	"Despite all hope and anticipation surrounding the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the project was never destined to be a success. In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there are many obstacles described that the builders faced as they attempted to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. The first major obstacle that the builders came upon was that when a dirigible was mounted onto the mooring ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"". This obstacle caused the need for an abundance of extra support on the frame needed to maintain sturdiness of the building. The other, and arguably greatest obstacle that the builders faced were the rapid wind currents that surrounded the building. The winds caused problems for the dirigible because ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". This caused a major design flaw for the builders in the way that they would have to maintain control and safety of the dirigible as it was docked by the mooring. As much as the plan dwarfed others of its time, it was short-lived. The plan had far too many obstacles to overcome and serves better today as a memorable characteristic of the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
6726	6	Obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were problems such as strong winds a weak structure and public safety. The strong winds would almost make it imposible to hold it steady at the top while the weak structure would almost make it imposible to hold saflley at the top. with all of these hazards it is compleatly unsafe for people to ride, dock, and board these massive dirigibles at the top of the Empire State Building.	3	2		3

A second obstacle builders of the Empire State Building came upon on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building was the concerns of the thousands of citizen just below the tall building. After german dirigible was on fire in Jersey they realized how serious they situation can become.

6753	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock thousands of feet above the New York streets. One of their many problems was the sheer size of the dirigibles, somewhere as long as one-thousand feet. Another problem they faced was keeping the back of the ship from swiveling around the mooring mast. Usually, the backs of these blimp-like structure's were anchored down by lead weights, but to have lead weights dangling high above the streets was way to risky not to mention unpractical.	2	2		2																					
6755	6	"The architects, engineers, and workers or the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to attach a dirigible dock the top of the building. The first troubling encounter for the builders was they ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building."" The engineers and architects needed to make @NUM1 dollars worth of repairs to strengthen the buildings frame work. Mother nature herself was also a problem. The constantly shifting winds would make it hard to stay landed unless they were weighed down. Even weighing down the zeppelins proposed a threat of a weight falling and killing an innocent person. lastly a law prevented dirigibles from flying to low over a city. If a spike from another building hit and popped the ballon, there would be an absolute disaster. Overall there were many obstacles preventing the idea of a dirigible dock to ever become true."	3	3		3

6762	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by @ORGANIZATION2, certain obstacles such as foundation support, nature, and safety challenged the building of the docking station for dirigibles.

""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, @CAPS2 @NUM2) This change was stated to cost over sixty thousand dollars. Another obstacle the builders faced upon constructing the mooring mast, was nature. At this height, the wind currents are violent and unpredictable. Despite being tethered to the building, the dirigibles would spin and twist around the mass, an unsecure and dangerous aspect. Lastly, as the except claims the greatest reason for not being successful, the safety violations of the mast were too great. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident would have been...above a densely populated area such as downtown New York.""

6763	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock at the building. Drigibles are enormous steel framed balloons filled with hydrogen and helium maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders. Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building would let drigibles to anchor for several hours for refueling or service. But, the stress of the drigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be sent all the way to the buildings Foundation. This cost over @MONEY1 worth of modifications to be made to the framework. In May 6, 1937 when the Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey the builders realized how catastrofick it would have been taken place above the densely populated area of downtown New York. The winds at the top of the building would constantly shift due to harsh and violent air currents and the back of the ship would constantly swing around. Also, the existing law against airships flying too low over cities and urban areas would make drigibles not allowed to moor at the Empire State Building.

The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. If the Empire state building was going to make this happen they would have to change the frame of it. This was a top obstacle to overcome. Also an obstacle they would have to face was peoples safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable.

6768	6	Many obstacles faced the builders of Empire State Building. The biggest problem is The fact that it was illegal for a dirigible to fly that low in Urban areas, stated in paragraph @NUM1. Another problem was that most of the @ORGANIZATION2's dirigibles used hydrogen, which is very flamable. So if what happened to the Hindenburg happened at the empire state building then the accident would of been much worse. Especially with people walking the streets below, stated in paragraph @NUM2. Another problem was nature. The winds were ferocious at the top of he building and were always shifting. So if a dirigible was docked to the mask and the lead weights that keep the dirigible from floating away, like anchors, would be dangling over pedestrians ready to fall in an instant, stated in paragraph @NUM3.

All of the changes that would have to be made would add up to over sixty thousand dollars. Now, there would also be 102 floors.

Since there was wind, they would have to use lead weights to hold a dirigible in place. However above the city this would be ""neither practical nor safe"" (para @NUM2).

With this in mind, Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building, he would construct a mooring mast on the top of the building. This would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours, refuel, and also allow passengers go on and off. Adding a mooring mast seemed full proof at the time but this new construction plan endured on many obstacles.The first obstacle was how to add a mooring mast without adding stress to the building's frame. Architects detected that the stress of the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. This led to the second obstacle which was modifying and strengthening the the steel frame of the Empire State Building to accommodate the first obstacle. Finally the third obstacle, which was the expense. Modifying the building's new frame work would cost over sixty thousand dollars.Consequently, Al Smith saw a great oppertunity for the Empire State Building but he was faced with many obstacles.	3	3		3																					
6787	6	"In the excerpt @ORGANIZATION2, written by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the empire State building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock There, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing areas."" (paragraph 6). If the Dirigibles can't lead it could cause destruction and could be very dangerous to people. In paragraph @NUM1 Al Smith says, It's on level all right no kidding wer'e working on the thing right now."" This shows the readers that the way he words things sounds almost unreliable. When constructing the idea of Dirigibles a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building to allow passengers on and off. However This idea was unsafe. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on street was neither practical nor safe."" (paragraph @NUM2). This unsafe why would the build something harmful to others. In the excerpt The Mooring Mast written by @ORGANIZATION1. The builders have a hard time constructing the dirigibles."	2	2		2																					
6788	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The most influentiel obstacle was nature. According to the passage, ""the Winds at the top of the building were constantly Shifting."" This would make it hard for dirigibles to dock in the first place. If they even succeeded in docking then the back of the dirigibles would shift and float around. The only way to solve that would be to add weights to the back of the dirigibles. Then weights would be floating high above the heads of pedestrians, which ""was neither practical or safe.""Another huge obstacle in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock was the law. At that time there was a law against any kind of aircraft to ""fly too low over urban areas."" As the passage clarifies ""This law would make it illegal for a ship took even tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1, the mooring mast idea was dropped."	3	3		3																					
6790	6	In the excerpt Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their. One obstacle was, many modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. the dirigible's load and wind pressure would have to be transmitted to buildings foundation. Another reason builders face many obstacles is, most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. This would be very dangerous if a fire occured especilly in a highly populated area. Another reason is due to violent air currents the back of a dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. As it says on page @NUM1, paragraph @NUM2 the dirigible would dangel above pedestrians on the street which isnt practical or safe. Lastly, an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas and it is illegal for dirigibles to tie up to the building or even approach the building. In conclusion builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their.	4	3		4																					
6791	6	"The builders @CAPS1 many problems when attempting to build a dirigible dock on the Empire State Building which ranged from legal, to structural, to logistical problems. Firstly there was a law in place which restricted airships From ""flying too low over urban area's"" as explained in paragraph @NUM1. In addition to this legal problem, the builders @CAPS1 the structural problem of putting a mooring mast on top of a skyscraper. According to the article the stress of the dirigible load along with wind pressure would have to be transmited over eleven hundred feet to the foundation. Because of this added weigh over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to the building as cited in paragraph @NUM2. Also the logistics of docking a dirigible at such an altitude were quite challenging. In fact half of the attempted dirigible landings at the Empire State Building were aborted due to high winds. Although a dirigible landing mast would have put the Empire State Building on the forefront of modern travel, it could not be done due to legal, structural and logistical problems."	3	3		3																					
6792	6	"The builders faced multiple obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building. If the thousand-foot dirigible tried to land on top of the Empire State Building, it ""would add stress to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The building would then have to be modified to meet these needs. Nature played as a big obsticle, as well. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the dirigible tried to land, the back of it would swivel around and around the landing zone, creating an unsafe enviroment. Finally, the government also prevented dirigibles from docking on the building. There was, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). These three main reasons prevented dirigibles from landing on top of The Empire State Building."	3	2		3																					
6793	6	The builders of the empire state building faced @NUM1 major obstacles. One major problem was that they used hydrogen which is highly flammable and they were in a highly populated area. Another problem had to do with laws, because aircrafts aren't allowed to fly to low over urban areas. Also the strong winds at that height made it impposible to land. Many problems are faced in the building of the empire state building.	2	2		2

Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"". Then there was a law that air craft should not fly too low over urban areas.

6798	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, obstacles builders faced building a mast for dirigibles to dock there are detailed One obstacle builders faced was how to go about attaching it. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another obstacle would be the accumulated cost of the renevisions due to the first problem. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work."" These obstacles prevented the mast for ever being used its intended purpose."	2	2		2																					
6801	6	"Many obstacles faced the builders of the Empire State Building in their attempts to dock dirigibles or zeppelins. First and foremost, a mooring mast would have to be added to the building. However, according to @ORGANIZATION2, ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" before a dirigible could be moored to the mast. Secondly, outside of the United States, most dirigibles used highly flammable hydrogen gas, rather than helium, as shown in @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1. The owners realized that it would be quite dangerous to have a dirigible moored over downtown New York, after the German ""Hindenburg"" ""was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1."" (@ORGANIZATION2 @NUM1). In accordance with @ORGANIZATION2 @NUM3, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Violent winds, caused by air currents at the top of the building would cause a moored dirigible to swivel, and using lead weights to counter this would be dangerous over such a densely populated area. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los @CAPS1 could not even dock in December 1930 due to winds. Lastly, an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas made it illegal for a ship to tie up to the mast anyway. (p @NUM4)"	4	4		4																					
6805	6	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced was many things surrounding safety and money issues. Successfully docking the dirigible would mean spending over @MONEY1 more, to make arrangements to the building. Also, there were many safety problems such as the gas the dirigible carried, the danger of people below in the city, and it was against the law for airships to be flying so low.	2	2		2																					
6806	6	The Empire State building faced hardships while trying to dock their dirigibles. The builders tried to build a docking station for the dirigibles, but the only problem they had was safely docking in thousands of feet in the air. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Winds in New York would also make it difficult to land. Another reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was the laws about airships flying too low over urban areas. Not only was it illegal, but also unsafe. Most dirigibles from out of the United States were made with a highly flammable gas called hydrogen. A German dirigible was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The owners of the Empire State building relized how bad it could've been in a highly populated area such as New York.	3	3		3																					
6807	6	"The idea of the Empire State building being used to dock dirigibles may seem ridiculous now, but upon its construction, this was the original purpose of the mast at the top. Of course, there are several reasons as to why this plan didn't come to fruition. First of all, there was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"", which would make it impossible to tie a dirigible to a building legally. Also, the high powered air currents atop the building would cause a docked dirigible to sway uncontrollably, making it a safety hazard. Finally, many non-U.S. dirigibles used hydrogen to fly instead of helium, and if a dirigible were to explode like the Hindenburg over the city, it would be incredibly dangerous for civilians. These reasons give credibility to the idea that the Empire State Building would not make a safe dirigible docking bay."	3	3		3																					
6809	6	Although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the Empire State Building was a well thought out plan, it provided some obstacles for builders. The biggest problem was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. If an accident, such as fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as New York City. Another factor affecting building was nature. The winds above were constantly shifting due to currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging above a city of people. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low in urban areas. This law makes it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to work.	3	3		3																					
6810	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with some big obstacles. One obstacle was they had to make sure that the Dirigibles could dock safely. They had to be sure that the passengers could get off and on safely. Lastly they had to be sure the building would not collapse when they made the mooring mast. These examples shows that the builders were faced with many obstacles when building the Empire State Building."	1	2		2																					
6812	6	"The obstacles The @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced was a law That was against airships flying low over urban areas. The other problems the @CAPS1 of the Empire state building, faced was when The U.S. Navy driigble los Angeles approached The mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of force ful winds.     The first obstacle the @CAPS1 had faced in attempting to allow drigibles dock was an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever fly up to a building The second Reason why the builder faced ob stacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock was in ""1930 U.S Navy drigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because forceful winds They @CAPS3 wind would blow dirigible to sharp spires. These are the obstacles the @CAPS1 of Empire State building faced to allow dockin."	3	3		3																					
6814	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building encountered obstacles in trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast on top of the building. The main problem was perhaps that foreign dirigibles don't use helium, they use hydrogen. Using hydrogen was a huge problem because hydrogen is extremely flammable. If a problem did occur, hypothetically, that a dirigible caught fire it would cause a threat to New York City which is highly populated. If the dirigible blew up the people of New York would not have enough time to get away from the blast. Another problem was winds. Winds can easily blow the dirigible off its course of worse into a spire on top of a building and puncture it. This problem was discovered when the U.S navy dirigible ""Los Angeles"" Was attempting to reach the mooring mast. The captain couldn't get anywhere near the mast. These obstacles and dangers suggest the mooring mast is a bad idea. Which the constructers later came to realize."	3	3		3

The architects couldnot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State buildings flat roof. A thousand- foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frames. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over Sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."	1	1		1																					
6818	6	"During the construction of the Empire State Building's dirigible dock there were three major obstacles: the wind, the structure, and the safety. The wind was the most obvious flaw in the landing dock because of the rough wind currents at the top of the building. Landing perfectly on the dock was one thing, but staying there was impossible because you would have been whipped around. ""[@ORGANIZATION2 dirigible Los Angeles] feared that the wind would blow the dirigible on to the sharp spires of other buildings of the area, which would puncture the shell."" (paragraph @NUM1)The problem of structuring the mast to hold the balloon would also become a structural obstical because ""[they] couldn't simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"" (paragraph @NUM2) To get the structure sound enough to land a dirigible they would have to do sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications to the framework.Lastly, landing a huge metal balloon ontop of the largest skyscraper, over millions of citydwellers, even when they knew the balloons were highly flamable, was one of the reasons the mooring mast didn't work out. Although there were two attempts of landing, neither succeeded, and now the mast is there only for decoration."	3	3		3																					
6819	6	"The builders and the architects faced many issues in making this project of extending the Empire State Building to 1,250 feet height. Though they planned their steps into making the mooring mast on top was unrealistic. It was unrealistic because this was never done before on top of a building. Another obstacle they faced was safety of the passengers and in general, because most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, which was highly flammable. Another obstacle they faced was with the weather, because landing a dirigible on top of the building with fast winds due to the violent air currents was also dangerous for the people on the dirigibles and could've possibly hit other building by swiveling around in the air from the winds. The last obstacle the builders faced, was that their project was illegal, against the federal law because the dirigibles would be flying to close to urban areas such as New York City, so therefore be impossible to accomplish, as shown in paragraph @NUM1. In this paragraph it states ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. This shows prof of the project's incapability to be built."	3	3		3																					
6825	6	"The dream of the aviation pioneers of docking their dirigibles on the Empire State Building, created obstacles for the builders to face. The mooring mast of the building ""was destined to never fulfill its purpose,"" the author implying that the building should not have been built, because of all these obscured obstacles. One obstacle they faced was the violent winds on top of the building, due to air currents. It was difficult for the dirigibles to dock. The ""four-blocks"" length blimp, filled with helium and hydrogen, would be dangling high above, which was not safe for the millions of people on the streets. In December 1930, the dirigible Los Angeles could not get close enough to the mooring mast because of forceful winds. Another obstacle the builders faced was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The Columbia blimp tried to deliver bundles of newspapers to the building, ending up with papers dangling on the rope from the blimp, because the dirigible mooring equipment was never installed. Therefore it was ""desirable to postpone to a later date that the final installation of the landing gear"" that gave airplanes the title of ""transportation of the future."""	3	3		3																					
6826	6	The builders of the Empire State Building came upon some problems when putting in the dock for dirigibles. First, the sheer height of the building makes catching the dirigibles dangerous because of the tower's structure @CAPS1, If the dirigible was to crash, it would be falling onto a big citie's streets. Finally, most dirigibles were filled with hydrogen and that is highly flammable. That is why the mooring mast was dangerous.	1	2		2																					
6827	6	The Mooring Mast has two obstacles @CAPS1 the winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other reason dirigibles could not moor at the @ORGANIZATION1 law against airship flying too low over urban area. They try to get close but they can't because of forceful winds. In nineteen thirty the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles approched the mooring but not get close. So they stablish a low to a securit for a urban Area.	2	2		2																					
6834	6	Al Smith and his workers, went through quite a bit while working on this building. As an example, while building it they had to transmitt the stress of the dirigibles load all the way to the buildings foundation, which was around eleven hundred feet below. After that they would have to modify and strengthen the frame of the building to accommodate the new situation. The greatest obstacle throughout the whole process though was the nature itself. Due to violent air currents the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. Safety was a major obstacle Smith had to face while building this building. Smith thought a dirigible would be okay to use on the building but little did he know how dangerous using one could be. Due to the fact most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, using hydrogen, meant HIGHLY flammable.	3	3		3																					
6836	6	They faced many problems when trying to dock there. It should never have been made in the first place. To many things were predictable. They had no landing gear, The wind was too great a factore, and the Ships couldent get close enough to The mast to dock.The people creating This over looked the possibility of it not working and only looked torde building it. They had no landing gears what so ever so it was hard to steady it and dock it. The wind was unpredictable and swung the balloon around. The biggest thing was when they slowed it down and had no wind it still couldent get close enough to dock. Those are The @CAPS1 problems they faced.	2	2		2																					
6839	6	Creating a mooring mast to sit atop the Empire State Building that would function and allow dirigibles to dock there was an incredibly challenging task for those who built the Empire State Building. Because the building was not originally designed to support the extra weight and size of a mooring mast, architects had to work to redesign the frame of the whole building. The architects modified plans to strengthen the steel frame of the building enough so that it could handle the added stress of a mooring mast. While builders were able to fix this problem, many obstacles remained that could not be avoided. One of these was the danger of attempting to control a dirigible. Dirigibles were often inflated with highly flammable hydrogen which would threaten the safety of the citizens of highly populated New York City. Also, dirigibles were traditionally weighed down with lead while docked to keep the blimb from floating around in the wind. This could not be done on the Empire State Building because it would mean lead bricks would be dangling over pedestrians constantly. Besides all these practical obstacles, it was against the law for aircrafts to fly over urban areas, and that was the final obstacle that kept the mooring mast from being used.	3	4		4																					
6840	6	"There were many obsticles in the process of building the process to build a mooring mast. The designers had to think they're way around them.It was easily known you couldn't just go up to the top and start construction. There were acomidations to be made. The exerpt describes, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation..."" (@CAPS1). Just adding it on would upset the buildings structure and foundation.Safety was a concern. People realized it was a bad idea to have something as highly flammable as the dirigible. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" (@CAPS1). After recent fires, it was noticed now dangerous this idea was.Control was an issue in the city; rather than an open feild. ""... the back of the ship would swivle around the mooring mast"" (@CAPS1). That wasn't going to'fly' with most people, It would be almost imposible to keep it @CAPS4 for people loading. Designers face a lot of problems in constructing buildings but in this case, the mooring mast just wasn't ment to be."	3	2		3																					
6841	6	"The Empire state building was destined to reach new limits that had never been met or even thought of in the world of architecture as described in ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 was determined efforts in building a mast not only set the Empire State building at the tallest building, at @NUM1 ft., though to also serve a useful purpose, was a radical dream supported with intuitive design and high goals. Unfortunately the reality in successfully completing this far reached destination was slim as problems gradually arose. The largest obstacle was ""... one of safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is flammable."" This along with the fact that violent air currents at such great heights required that lead weights weighted dirigible down to prevent from extreme movement, served as serious caution the safety of the highly populated New York City surrounding the Empire State building. As practicality in the hopeful moore mast diminished it became... ""desirable to post to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" The use of the moore mast ""quietly disappeared"", concluding the radical dreams."	2	2		2																					
6842	6	Al Smith had a vision; to create a site for modern travel. Smith faced many obstacles and persisted with hard efforts in attempt to bring his vision to life. The stress of a thousand foot dirigible would have been to much pressure for the original framework of the Empire State Building. Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to strengthen the buildings framework. In addition the builders had designed a mast the would be rocket-shaped, made with aluminum, which could accomadate the mooring arm, and the control machienery would be in the shaft; housing elevators and stairs for passengers on the dirigible. Another obstacle they had to face was the lack of floors that would serve as a boarding area for the passengers. They had begun to build additinoal floors with a glassed-in observation area and a boarding area. Although the mooring mast for the dirigibles was a fiasco, Al Smith and many architects tried to make all the modifications they could have to fulfill Smith's vision for what he thought was the Empire State Building's destiny	2	2		2

Another obstacle the Architects had to work with was putting the mooring mast up on the building. So, then they had to add over sixty thousand dollars' added to the framework of the building so that it would be sturdy for the mooring mast. Once the mooring mast was set up and they ""celebrated framing the entire building,"" just another problem occurred ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself,"" the winds were constantly shifting and caused the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast.

If breaking the law wasn't a large enough obstacle, then the issue of New York citizen's safety also came into play. Most dirigibles were dangerous due to their flamability. So one wrong move could have killed many ""if it had [exploded] above a densley populated area""Another huge obstacle the came into play was the lightness of the dirigibles, that would allow it's rear to ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The only way to stop that would to again, put the citizens in danger."	2	3		3																					
6847	6	The builders of the Empire States Building encoutered many obstacles in the attempt to allow blimps to dock on the building. The engineers realized from the start that even if they could get a blimp docked, it would put additional stress on the buildings structure. to fix this, they had to reinforce the entire building. In addition to this, the docking of a blimp was dangerous in itself. It could easily be destroyed like the Hindenburg	2	2		2																					
6853	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted shares some of the obstacles that were dealt with when trying to make it possible for blimps to land atop the Empire State Building. L�sted discusses the obstacles of nature, safety, laws, and construction in ""The Mooring Mast"". Nature presented a huge setback in terms of docking dirigibles. As L�sted writes, ""even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". The safety of docking blimps on the Empire State Building also became issue. ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse ""an accident could be if it happened above downtown New York, instead of in a field. The laws in affect of the time made it illegal for airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law makes docking a dirigible impossible in New York City. The construction alone of accommodating a mooring mast required ""over @NUM1 dollars worth of modifications"" and a lot of time and planning. As L�sted says, ""The mooring mast of The Empire State Building was destined to never fufill its purpose"". The obstacles presented in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were too great and too many. The laws, safety, construction, and nature of the time were too big a setback for this endeavor."	3	3		3																					
6854	6	There are a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle would be the building of the mooring mast to be added to the top of the building. Although it was a good idea, it was very complicated. Another Reason consists of law @CAPS1. There was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. New York is defanitley not the City for this idea just because there is alot of people walking around the @CAPS2 and there is many buildings around. This idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building would @CAPS3 to be over with the invention of airplanes. The idea @CAPS4 disappeared.	2	1		2																					
6855	6	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacles the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the buildings frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it will invole the the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework of the building will cost too much money. The stress of the building will come from the dirigibles's load and wind pressure. Another Obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constinously shift. They didnt wand to use lead weights because it was to dangerous. because they were dangling high over predestrains. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock.	3	3		3																					
6858	6	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, many contractors were exceedingly determined to construct a mast on the Empire State building to sanction the use of dirigibles, or blimps, to be the way of air travel for the future. There were great amounts of obstacles in the way of making this a reality. Allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building was a fantastic idea, but at the same time, proved to be just an impossible theory.The first problem was the weight of the blimp with the combined malicious winds, to eventually shatter the beautiful framework of the building. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" Architects soon fixed that problem when they impulsively spent over sixty thousand dollars on changes to the building to support this flaw, but this was not the only problem. The second major concern was the hydrogen that would be filling these blimps. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Hydrogen can easily create fires, which is a top concern in a densely populated city such as New York City. The most immense obstacle was mother nature. ""The winds on top of buildings were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" With dirigible flying above thousands of civilians, an uncontrolled aircraft due to high winds is not safe. The last impractical reason why this idea was not realistic was because of the law that forbade airships to fly too low in urban areas. All of those obstacles made building a mast on The Empire State building only a dream.Al Smith, the architect of The Empire State building, came up with fascinating ideas. Although they were great, they did not work. Between the environment, winds, hydrogen use, and safety laws, his dream was just a hoax. These obstacles made it impossible to proceed construction. Al Smith had amazing imagination with bad luck."	4	4		4																					
6859	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the mooring mast had to face obstacles that hindered the success of the docking of the dirigibles. First, the architects had to design the mast. They knew that the frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened to carry the load and wind pressure of the dirigible. Therefore, they ""designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the buildings skeleton"" and planned for the reconstruction of the building and mast. Workers were excited with their plans and ready to watch the launch of a revolutionary moment. However, once they realized the many problems with their construction plan, they faced many roadblocks that prevented the plan to follow through. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable,"" proving that the mooring mast was unsafe and could lead to potential accidents. Also, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". Showing the physical insecurity of the ship on the dirigible. Lastly, the law states restrictions on airships flying too low, and the dirigibles would be breaking that law. Even though builders wanted to provide a launching pad for the dirigibles and had an ideal design, there were too many faults that made the mooring mast impossible to bring to reality. Clearly, the builders faced many problems that could not have been solved in trying to allow the dirigibles to dock"	4	4		4																					
6863	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced such as the high winds, and how they could dock the dirigibles when it is against the law to fly an aircraft to low near urban areas. one obstacle the builders faced was the safety of the dirigibles anchoring above busy streets filled with people and high winds. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable, so any foreign dirigible that was anchored at the Empire State building would cause a safety issue because the high winds at the top of the building could cause an accident to occur causing the dirigible to blow up and potentially endanger pedestrians. Another obstacle the builders faced is the law that made it illegal for dirigibles to ever dock at building because it was illegal for aircrafts to fly to low near urban areas and it would have been a long process to ever get the government to let them.	3	3		3																					
6866	6	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building were severe. The greatest and most important obstacle they faced was safety. If a plan is not completely safe, it shouldn't happen. The Empire State Building would not have been stable enough with the winds being so powerful. Also, most dirigibles or blimps used hydrogen not helium which would be extremely dangerous if the blimp caught on fire. Especially in a place as crowded as New York. This was another problem with landing a dirigible on the Empire State Building.                                                                                                                                                                  Another obstacle was the wind. A dirigible could not land unless it was weighted down with lead weights which also was not a bit safe for people walking freely in New York City. These problems are the reasons why the dirigibles could not land on the Empire State Building	3	4		4																					
6867	6	In attempt to make the Empire State Building higher than the Chrysler Building, the builders ran through a few obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there.One obstacle was because of safety reasons. Dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen, not helium. Hydrogen was more flammable, causing the builders to realize if an accident like when the German dirigible was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey it would be more worse if it was to happen in a populated area such as downtown New York. Known as one of the greatest obstacles attempting to use the mooring mast was through nature. If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around and around due to the winds on top of the building.The practical obstacle the builders faced was by law. An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. Having to tie up the dirigible to the building would be illegal. But as years passed on the idea of using the mooring mast died out leaving there to be no more obstacles to face.	3	3		3																					
6873	6	"While building the Empire State building, the builders faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The original problem was figuring out how to get the dirigible onto the building. After consulting with the Navy as well as meeting with the president of newly formed ""airship transport company."" After this they thought they were past the rough of it, but there were many obstacles to come. Next, as they began constructing the mass, they realised with the height of the building, dirigibles landing would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The frame of the building would have to be modified to help fix this problems, and it cost over @MONEY1 to make these modifications. The prior two obstacles had been resolved, but the next bunch of obstacles caused the attempt, of dirigibles to dock, to stop in its tracks. Many safety problems posed as obstacles for the building team. It could be very dangerous, as some gases used in dirigibles are extremely flameable. Another obstacle is the ability to safely dock, at such high altitudes, with ""constantly shifting"" air currents. All of these problems were amplified because it was even more unsafe for these problems to exist in such a populated area. The build team was able to overcome some obstacles, but some caused too many potential problems to be fixed."	4	4		4																					
6875	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Another obstacle would have to be that the builders didn't check the laws of the city because an aircraft can fly that low over urban areas such as New York City so this law prevented and made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. The last obstacle that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with public safety and this was the greatest reason. This project with the public in danger because if a dirigible went down in flames over a highly populated city like New York city it would be catastrophic! For example the German dirigible the Hindenburg did in lakehurst, New Jersey then the accident would be much worse & many people would die.	3	3		3																					
6876	6	"While building the mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building struggled through many difficulties and issues. First they had to make sure the dirigible wouldn't tear down the framework of the building. Because the dirigible was so large and heavy the dirigible added with the wind would ""be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" which was at the bottom. This had to be addressed, or the building would have been destroyed. Even before this, workers had to learn how dirigibles worked and how they could be docked on the buildings. They ""consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment"" just in order to learn how a dirigible flies and how it would be docked. Probably the most important thing the workers had to keep in mind was the safety of the public. This was very difficult to do, and unfortunately, it wasn't possible to build this mast so it would be safe for the public. This eventually led to the mast never being used as a docking station."	3	2		3																					
6877	6	The Greatest Obstacle the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical or safe. (@CAPS1 @NUM1)	2	2		2																					
6879	6	"The excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, describes the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, after the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire, the fear of such an accident occurring in a densely populated areas such as New York posed a problem, because most international dirigibles used flammable hydrogen instead of helium. Another obstacle was the nature of the mooring mast, and the violent air currents that cause shifts in wind. Having a dirigible moored to the top of the Empire State Building, ""dangling high above the pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe"" (paragraph @NUM1). Also, there was an existing laws that prohibited airships from flying too low over urban areas, therefore making ""it illegal for ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" (paragraph @NUM2). The architects of the project were so excited by the novelty of the idea that they were blind to these potential difficulties. These obstacles and unsolved problems contributed to the unsuccess of the mass, and the idea disappeared and was forgotten"	4	3		4																					
6880	6	The builders faced a lot of issues to allow drigibles to land place on the Empire State Building. The builders had to be very cautious or carefull on building the platform to allow drigibles to dock. The drigibles (Blimp) were very big transportation machines that were made out of Steel and Cotton Fabric that was filled with hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is a flamable substance which the builders had to be carefull with power and electricity supplies. To allow a blimp to dock above @NUM1 feet in the air on the Empire State Building, they need to work on the framing of the building so it there is any bad weather condition, the building would not collapse, and would be stable. Because of all these problems the procautions the builders had to make, makeing the mast was a failuer and left for the future transportations to plains.	2	2		2																					
6881	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was they to reconstruct the building to add the mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommidate this new situation."" @CAPS1 the mast was an obstacle they had to face. Also, the had to face all of the safety requirements. ""Was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After they figured out what could go wrong if they docked dirigibles the original purpose of the mast was not able to be fulfilled. Another obstacle they had to face was testing there plan to dock dirigibles. ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up."" The dirigible failed in their attempt and the idea of docking dirigibles disappeared in the late 1930's. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. "	2	1		2																					
6883	6	Al Smith and his group of architects encountered many problems when they attempted to build a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building in order to dock dirigibles. Before they began building, the architects realized that they could not land a dirigible on the buildings flat roof. They had to make over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications to the framework before they could think of docking dirigibles there. After they finished building the conical top of the Empire State Building, the team working on the project realized that dirigibles could never be docked at the Empire State Building for several reasons. First, landing dirigibles was dangerous to the people of the city. Dirigibles contained hydrogen, which is highly flammable, and if there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York City, the damage would be devastating. Nature also prevented dirigibles from docking at the Empire State Building; air currents were too powerful, and if the ship did land, it would swivel around the spire of the building. It was possible to prevent this by putting lead weights into the back of the dirigible, but this was also unsafe for the people that lived underneath. The last obstacle the architects faced was an existing law that prevented airships from flying too low over urban areas. Although the architects had a great idea, they never realized why it would not work until after building.	4	4		4																					
6885	6	"In the passage The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @ORGANIZATION2 t buiders of the Empire State Building faced with obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One example is ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building flat roof. This is saying that you need to have a solid amount of support to hold a dirigible. Another is ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen not Helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. So if that were to catch fire in the middle of New York City That would not be good. Another is the changing wind speeds would cause the dirigible to sway in the air. This could cause issues with stability. So in this passage The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 had to overcome obstacles and attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
6890	6	The obstacles which the builders of the empire state building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were numerous for this project. The first problem was that, other dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen. Hydrogen is a much more flammable substance than helium, which is what dirigibles in the United States used. The owners didn't want anything to occur similar to the German dirigible the Hindenburg, which would be worse in downtown New York instead of Lakehurst, New Jersey. Another practical reason why dirigibles faced problems docking at the Empire State building was that an existing law prevented dirigibles from flying too low over urban areas. For example a @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible named the Los Angeles, could not get close enough to tie up due to forceful winds. These problems go to show that owners of the Empire State building faced numerous obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																					
6894	6	Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task, creating this futureistic design carried alot of problems beside it. Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there were also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York.Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg. But and accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical. Because of these problems and more, the thought of using a Mooring Mast to dock Dirigibles was quitely retired.	3	3		3																					
6897	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced a myriad of obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This means that any little spark inside the dirigible would send it up in flames. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to the violent air currents.' This proves that having the dirigible docked up there would be very dangerous and would call for weights to be used to anchor the back of the dirigible. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire State building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This symbolizes that it is against the law to have an airship that close to a highly populated area. The idea of docking dirigibles at the empire state building were ignored."	4	3		3																					
6900	6	The builders had many obstacles to allow the dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was they had to make sure the building was high enough. They also had to make sure the building was durable enough. Those are some of the obstacle they had to allow the dirigibles to dock there.	1	1		1																					
6902	6	The builders of the Empire State building had alot of problems in biulding the @CAPS1. How Would they be able to allow dirigables to @CAPS1 there? High Winds and laws stood in the biulders way. The fram of the building had to be renforced so it would not fall to the ground. The landing gear date had to be postponed due to building scedual's.  Whe a dirigible did try to land it couldnt. The air streems were too much for it. In the end the idea was unrealistic. High winds and laws prevented the @CAPS1 from ever being used.	2	2		2																					
6907	6	Obstacles the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.	1	2		2																					
6909	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a existing law. In paragraph @NUM1 saying the reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state Building cause of an existing law against airship flying too low under urban area and the law would make it illegal for a ship to even tie or even approach the mooring mast.	1	2		2																					
6910	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was ""the fact that the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) That would make it hard for the dirigibles to be tethered to the mast. Annother problem they faced was the ""existing laws against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) Also the equipment used to to dock the airships haden't even been installed."	2	2		2																					
6912	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  One obstacle that faced the builders was that the dirigibles could not simply land on top of the building.  The thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building.  They would have to ""transmit"" the load and the wind pressure to the foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.  The builders had to make over @MONEY1 worth of modifications.  Another reason was nature.  As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"".  The dirigible could not be teathered down because the lead weights would be dangling above pedestrians.  A final obstacle was an already existing law.  The law was against airships flying too low over urban areas.  This made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.  These obstacles destined the mooring mast to never fulfill its purpose."	3	3		3																					
6913	6	"In attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, many problems were faced. One problem faced was in paragraph nine where it says, ""A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" If the did build the dirigible dock, the would have to reinforce the whole building so it would not collapse. Another problem faced was, most dirigibles used hydrogen, not helium. Therefore since hydrogen is Flammable they could not take the risk of a dirigible blowing up over a heavily populated area. A more ******* problem was the weather, specifically the wind, at @NUM1 feet. The air currents were so violent, that the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles usually land in an open field where they could be anchored by lead. According to the excerpt, dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, the most major problem was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM2, the law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Even through the dirigible dock was a great idea, too many problems were in conflict with the mooring mast for it to go in full effect. On the brighter side, it made the Empire State building the tallest in the world."	3	3		3																					
6914	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One problem was that they had to strengthen the rest of the building in order to put the mast at the top. This process would be very costly, the author says ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another problem in the attempt of allowing dirigibles to dock there was the winds at the top of the building. The air currents were very violent that high up. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" therefore it would not be safe for people on the streets of the city. Finally, the laws of the city interfered with the plan for the mooring mast. The law said that it was illegal for an airship to fly too low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock on the mooring mast, it would be breaking this law. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems, and their plan never actually followed through."	3	3		3																					
6915	6	"The Empire State Building faced various obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Most importantly was the danger involved in this ambitious plan. Blimps from outside the @LOCATION3 commonly used hydrogen, a highly flammable gas, instead of helium. After a German dirigible destroyed in a fire, owners of the Empire State Building saw the true danagers of an accident like this in downtown New York. Successful use of the mooring mast was another obstacle. The winds at such a high altitude made it difficult to dock. Once docked the dirigibles would have to dangle above pedestrians, which was ""neither pratical or safe"". The existing law against airships flying to low in urban areas create further probles. After the Los Angeles failed to reach the mooring mast because of the high winds the owners started to see the unsolved problems. By the late 1930's the idea had ""quietly disappeared""."	4	3		4																					
6917	6	The people who built the Empire State Building had many problems building it. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the of a suitable landing area. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at it's top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come.	2	1		2																					
6920	6	In order to build the Empire State building, some Of the workers endured problems while constructing it. The engeineeres and architects consulted first with the experts. The obstacles the builders had to face were, one the height. It was a thousand feet and it was putting stress on the buildings frame. Wind pressure also added stress to the one thousand foot building. Another big obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting to the violent air currents. Even when the mooring mast was tethered or tied up the back part of the ship would sway from the wind. In the end the author says or implies that it was never meant to be built because of all the problems that came with it.	2	1		2																					
6921	6	"The future of allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building became unrealistic when issues of safty came forward and when test runs did not go as planned. Some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than hellium which could be flamable. ""the owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse than accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area."" By placing a dock in the heart of New York City its risking the lives of too @CAPS1 passengers and citizens.When the dock was in place at the top of the Empire state building two dirigibles tried landing but both times it was a failure. There were @CAPS1 problems and landing, one being the wind. ""dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 dangers stop this plan to happen."	2	2		2																					
6922	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced a few main obstacles in attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there atop the building. These three main obstacles where the designing of the mast and the building modifications, safety, and existing laws about aircrafts. The designing of the mast was an obstacle because a dirigible moored to the mast would add stress to the building's frame. The load and pressure had to be transmitted to the base of the building and they faced ""over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications"" to do so. One of the other problems was, most importantly, safety. The article states that most countries used hydrogen in their balloons to stay afloat, unlike the United States who used helium. This was dangerous for hydrogen is flammable, and the building owners did not want a repeat of the Hindenburg accident when a German dirigible was destroyed by fire. Also, a dirigible had to be weighted down or it'd spin around the mast and the commonly used lead weights were a hazard for pedestrians below. The last main obstacle of the Empire State building's builders was the existing law banning airships from flying low above urban areas. It would be illegal for a dirigible to approach the area let alone tether to the building. These are three of the main obstacles which the builders faced in building the Empire State building and its mast. Design, safety, and legal issues all were obstacles which got the better of the builders."	4	4		4																					
6923	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had to deal with multiple problems involving safety. Because Al Smith wanted to build a building larger than the Chrysler Building he decided to put a mooring mast for dirigibles on top of his. The building's frame had to be modified before the construction of the mooring mast could begin because just putting on top would stress the frame and bring it down. Another issue was the landing of the dirigibles themselves. They could be weighed down when on flat land but not on top of a building there would be many people below who could be injured if something went wrong. There was even a law against dirigibles flying too low over urban areasThe builders had to work their way around. The biggest obstacle seemed to be safety for the people.	3	3		3																					
6929	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had to overcome many obstacles so the dirigibles could safely dock at the top to refuel or repair. People were thrilled for this idea, yet they knew how difficult this task would be. First of all, the building plan had to be redone due to the Chrysler building's builders tactic about sneaking around to make the building taller than the Empire State Building. Al Smith was not going to let that happen so he decided to make the @CAPS1.S.B. even taller. (1,250 ft.) secondly, the builders had to come up with a way to build the dock on a stable platform because it was unstable on the flat roof. This served as and obsticle because at such a height, construction is hard to do. Al Smith was more than determined though which enlightened the workers stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars"" worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework (L�sted, @NUM1). Also, the dock or landing dock, could not be used weather permitting. The dirigibles so close to the city, building, and civilians was dangerous when swaying around. The author says, ""some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City"" (6). There were violent wind currents that could make the dirigibles sway around the mooring mast. Last of all, an existing law against airships flying that low over urban areas was in place. This is a major contributor to the failed attempt. Being prohibited and breaking the law would get many in trouble. All and all, the attempt made by the architects of the Empire State Building proved dedication and good intentions, but their ideas were too irrational for the dock to become successful in society."	3	3		3																					
6930	6	"In the excerpt from, ""The @CAPS1 Mast"", by Marcia Amidon L�sted, it was mentioned that architects faced challenges when attempting when allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building One obstical they faced was the fact that they used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt it said that hydrogen is highly flammable @CAPS2 if something went wrong it could be a huge problem in a highly populated area like New York. The main problem they faced was the nature itall. It said ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" The dirigible has the potential to swivle around the mast and with all the pedestrians below that is very dangerous. These challenges are what led to the fate of the mooring mast not being used as originaly planned"	3	3		3																					
6931	6	It was unfortunate that such a great idea was never able to succeed. The builders of the Empire State building faced with many difficulties when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to design the Mask which sounds like a long and complicated process. Everything seemed as if it was going to work out. Builders started construction. After two months of construction, the mooring mast was not able to fulfill its purpose for several reasons. hydrogen is highly flammible and to dangerous to use in such a highly populated area. Things such as wind and nature itself would have made this wonderful idea impossible. There were laws that would have never allowed for this to happen anyway. If builders and planners had done better research they would have found this project to have been impossible before going through all the intense construction.	3	3		3																					
6934	6	One of the obvious reasons is the height of all this taking place. The strong, always changing winds, the winds were a problem because it would make the back of the blimp sway from side to side. Another problem was trying to stop the swaying of the ship, they consulted putting lead weights, but hanging weights above pedestrians is not safe at all. Another reason was, it was against the law to fly aircrafts to low to the ground. These are just some of the reasons why this wasn't gonna to work.	3	2		3																					
6935	6	Even beginning to build the dock of the empire state building was A mistake. What first appeared to be a worthwhile And realistic idea ended up being potentially horrific if it failed. One obsticle the builders faced in Attempt to Allow dirigibles to dock there was the law that did not Allow airships flying low over urban areas. It would be even illegal to continuously have ships closely over pedestrians. Another obstacle they fased where the unsafeness of it All. The winds A that height Are constantly different And could cause the Dirigibles to move Around. Having Airships dock at the empire state building was potentially dangerous As well As illegal.	2	2		2																					
6937	6	"During the construction of the Empire State Building the builders experience many obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that the builders cannot just drop a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State building. ""A thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable teather, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Another problem the workers faced is they would have to change the entire design of the building to meet the accommodations of the mooring dock. The largest reason why the dock didn't work out was safety. The author writes ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium..."" This means that the dirigibles are highly flameable and if one exploded over the densely packed New York it would have serious reprocusions. All of these reasons are why the mooring dock never came to life on top of the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
6947	6	"Many obstacles took place while builders of the Empire State building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the blimps docking on the building would be too much. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"". Another problem was that dirigibles were highly flameable and in such a highly populated area of New York it ""was neither practical nor safe"". Laws against airships flying too low over urban areas worked against the idea but two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped."	2	3		3																					
6948	6	"The construction workers faced many obstacles in building the Empire State building. One of those obstacles was hieght. Since they wanted to make the building the tallest building in the world they had to make sure there was enough technology to do so. Also they had to add an extra seventeen flores to the building making it 102 floors instead of its original @NUM1 floors. Another obstacle was its safety issues. The construction workers never checked into problems with building the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the author States, ""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to afixed mass at such a height made it describable to post pone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear."" the author is trying to say that when designing the production of the mooring mass; ""they overlooked certain issues that make them set back the final date. Due to these obstacles, the construction team managed to succeed in Building the tallest building, The Empire State building."	1	3		1																					
6949	6	"The Empire State Building faced obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles, ""enormous steel framed balloons"" commonly called blimps, dock there. One of the main issues was the pressure on the building caused by the dirigibles. As said in the excerpt The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, by @ORGANIZATION2, ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (paragraph @NUM1). Over @MONEY1 worth of modifications were made to strengthen and accommodate for this new situation of dirigibles."	2	1		2																					
6950	6	One obstacle the builders of the Empire state Building in attempt to allow dirigibles was, the stress from the mass & the dirigible and wind pressure would all be transmitted to the buildings foundation. The frame of the building would have to be strengthened to accommodate the new situation. There were also safety reasons. Since most states used hydrogen in stead of helium and hydrogen is flammable. If something were to happen and the dirigible was to catch fire. The fire could destroy New York City since it's so densely populated. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. It the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Plus it	3	3		3																					
6951	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced numerous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. While designing the mast, the architects faced problems including wind pressure, safety, and practicality. The frame was not strong enough to undergo the stress and wind pressure from the load of the dirigible. The foundation of the building, which was approximately @NUM1 feet below, would have had to be strengthened and modified if it was going to be able to handle the movement of the dirigible attached by a single cable tether. Safety was the greatest obstacle that the builders faced most dirigibles used hydrogen to make them lighter than the air. However, this hydrogen was highly flammable causing many dangers. Since New York City is such a thickly settled area, the risk of a fire was too dangerous to take. Finally, instead of dirigibles landing in open fields they would have to dock eleven hundred feet above the ground in the words of Marcia Amidon L�sted, ""using these (dirigibles) at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""	4	3		4																					
6952	6	There was three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the densely populated area, the violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. First, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Since the dock would be above downtown New York, there is a higher risk of the dock blowing up due to the density. Secondly, nature was a great obstacle. There were many winds on top of the building and the wind currents were constantly changing violently, there was a gigantic fear of the dirigible swiveling around and hitting another building. Finally, the dock could never allow a ship to be tied up legally due to the existing law of airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigible would not be safe, and the entire idea will drop. For these reasons or obstacles, many builders of the Empire state building faced while attempting to allow blimps to dock there.	3	3		3																					
6954	6	The builders had to go through many obstacles to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible to dock on the @ORGANIZATION2. The first thing that was a problem with geting it to the top of the Empire State Building. They said the wind made it really hard to get the dirigible up there with out it poping. There was also the safty of it being up there. There was already a fire from another dirigible catching on fire. The gases inside are really flamable and that would make a really big problem. The last thing that they had to conider was if Airships were to Low. The dirigible would pop. for all those reason they had to concider them to @CAPS1 to allow the dirigible on the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
6959	6	The Empire State Building was to be the tallest building ever made. At the top, was to be an accesable docking station for dirigibles called mooring masts. The idea of haveing a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building caused the whole building to be modified. It costed over sixty thousand dollars in modifications to accommodate the mooring mast. This project was the first of its kind and had many obsticles like the modifications. Some of those obsticles included the violent air currents and constant change in wind direction on top of the building. With the wind changes, the dirigible could swing around and hit the building or other buildings and fall on the densely populated New York City below. The solution to this was to tie lead bricks to the tail of the dirigible like what is used in the feilds when they land. Although the bricks keep the tail from moveing around, having them hang over a thousand feet above pedestrians was not save. In the end the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was disbanded due to many problems that could arise.	3	3		3																					
6960	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there and those obstacles include: the lack of a suitable landing area in @LOCATION1, a mooring mast was needed to the top of the building so dirigibles or blimps could anchor there for several hours for fuel, services, and to let passengers on and off, The steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and strengthened because a thousand-foot blimp mooring at the top of the building held by a cable tether would cause stress to the building frame. The blimps load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all through the buildings foundation which was somewhere about eleven hundred feet below. The last obstacle in the allowing blimps to dock at the Empire State Building was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas which would make it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area.	3	3		3																					
6964	6	"Marcia Amidon L�sted, author of ""The Mooring Mast,"" highlights not only the safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that solidified the failure of such transportation. Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would @CAPS1 motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building are tempted to dock dirigibles @NUM1 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace @NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build at @NUM1 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards."	3	3		3																					
6968	6	"When building the dock for dirigibles. Al Smith was only able to think of a few obstacles that would come up. As it turns out, there were more obstecles than expected. One that was expected was the building could be pulled over by the dirigibles as stated in paragraph @NUM1, third sentence. An obstacle that was unknown until after the mast was built was the violen shift in wind would cause the dirigibles to wrap itself around the mast and to dang weights off the back of it to prevent the wrapping was considered unsafe as stated in paragraph fourteen, second sentence to the fourth. Another untold issue was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM2, first sentence) along with the fact that ""most dirigibles outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. (paragraph @NUM3, second sentence). The whole idea of a docking mast was not well thought out."	3	3		3																					
6969	6	"During the time of the @DATE1's many obstacles came into play to the architects building a dirigible dock for them to land on top of the Empire State building. The builders had to face situations with weather conditions of this dock. The Empire State building was so high ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The weather conditions that were occurring high above of this 1,250 ft building made it difficult for dirigibles to dock themselves making the outcome unsafe. Builders also had to face the reality of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". with this law taking its action it made it illegal for a dirigible to even attempt a landing on these docks. The main concern of obstacles these builders constructing this landing dock would be the strong winds that would occur. The winds were so powerfull and strong that the blimp would face ""the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible's shell."" This obstacle of weather was a huge struggle to these architects making the dock of these dirigibles unsuccessful. The obstacles that were faced in constructed this dock came to the outcome of dirigibles being ""given away to airplanes""."	4	3		4

6973	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there included issues in safety, nature problems, and a dilemma with a law. Safety was a major concern as many dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. An example of such a dirigible was the German Hindenburg, which went up in flames in Lakehurst, New Jersey. As the article ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York City."" @CAPS1, nature was a big obstacle the owners faced, as the winds on top of the building constantly shifted. According to L�sted, this would have caused the back of the dirigibles to ""swivel around the mooring mast,"" which would not have been ""practical nor safe."" @CAPS2, there were legal issues the builders faced. There was a law at the time restricting airships from flying too low over populated areas. As the article notes, ""This law would make it illegal for shipped ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" The builders of the Empire State Building faced issues with safety, nature, and the law."	4	3		4																					
6976	6	"The men who were constructing the building did not put enough thought in to the practicality of the new form. One major issue with the dirigibles landing there to fuel up is the fact that they could explode. There had been blimp accident before and it wasn't in a heavily populated area like New York is. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1).The winds at the top of the building would also blow the back end of the blimp around, and it isn't safe to have lead weights hanging over pedestrians, and the Blimp would be to low.

6979	6	The obstacles the builders went through lallow dirigibles to dock there was that they wanted to put a mooring mast on the top of the Empire State buildings flat roof, but the problem was that the stress of the dirigible's load also the heavy wind pressure had to be transmitted to the buildings foundation, in which was about @NUM1 ft below.

Another one is ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" Which means they would have to waste even more money. Then something they found out later is they couldn't even do this, in the first place due to legal matters. If they did that then they would be getting themselves in trouble with the legal system.

6997	6	Based on excerpt The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were, to get it to work. For many reasons the builders would never get dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building.One reason this idea could never happen was because the dirigibles themselves were highly flammable. The hydrogen gas most places used to fuel there dirigibles made them highly flammable. In a highly populated areas such as New York this would be a problem.Another issue would be money. The builders would need more money to strengthen the building for the weight of the dirigibles. With a one thousand foot dirigible moored to the top of a building by a single cable tether there will be a lot of stress on the building.Finally the last reason would be safety. Violent winds would make dirigibles unstable When docked to the building. There is also an existing law against airships flying too low over Urban areas.In @CAPS2 based on excerpt The Mooring Mast; by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock were the flammability, money issues, and safety reasons.	4	4		4

The winds at the top of the Empire State Building shifted a lot to do to the violent air currents, even if the Dirigible was tied to the mast the wind would push the back all the way around the mast. Another obstacle that the builders had to overcome was that they feared that the lead weights that held the Dirigible down would be dangling over the edge of the building, leaving it unsafe for pedestrians and for the pilot and passengers on the blimp."	2	2		2																					
7002	6	The builders of the Empire State building went through many obstacles. I feel bad for them because of how dangerous it was, and how long they had to work. At the same time I would have been happy to be apart of something like that. The builders could have died doing there job. Building it so high up, it must have been hot. I dont think it had to be that high they could have done the same thing but lower. Those are some of the obstacles I think the builders went through.	0	0		0																					
7003	6	"There were a few challenges that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The mast couldn't just be dropped on the top of the building. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" All this stress would be transmitted to the foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the builders had to modify the whole building. The architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to existing plans for the building's skeleton."" The builders already had the building done but in order to dock the dirigibles, they needed to change the building. These architects worked hard to build something that could never be used because of the violent air currents. ""Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The architects put all their hard work into remodeling the building for nothing."	3	2		2																					
7005	6	"Although adding a mooring mast to the top of the Empire State building is a very clever idea, there are multiple problems and concerns that accommodate this new feature. For example, even if the cable were fastened strong enough to the one thousand-foot dirigible, it would add stress to the buildings frame, causing the building to grow weaker much quicker than without it. In addition, to alter the dirigibles large effect on the building, it would be neccssary to have the dirigible's weight and the wind pressure ""to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation,"" which was nearly impossible considering this distance was over @NUM1 feet @CAPS1, @CAPS2 was a large factor in building this futuristic structure; over Sixty thousand dollars had to be collected to see better support the building's structure"	2	2		2																					
7008	6	Architects constructing the Empire State Building encountered many obstacles for the mooring mast. During the 1920s dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. The idea of making a mast wasnt so farfetched at first. As construction neared completion many concerns arose. Many dirigibles outside the United States use the highly flammable gas known as hydrogen. Another problem was the docking of the blimps, winds on the Empire State Building constantly shifted which forced the rear of the dirigibles to rotate around the mooring mast. Lastly a law was formed to restrict airships from entering an urban area at low altitudes. When all the problems came together the idea of mooring dirigibles quietly disappeared.	3	2		3																					
7009	6	"In The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One big obstacle they had to overcome is when the dirigibles dock it would leave stress on the foundation of the building. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" Another obstacle the builders would have to overcome was the winds at the top of the building constantly shifting directions. They thought about putting weights on the dirigibles but then that would not be safe having them hang a thousand feet up over people. There was also a law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. Therefore the builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles to overcome."	3	3		3																					
7010	6	A mooring mast could just be put on top of the Empire State Building.  If thousand-foot dirigible more debt the top of the building, held by a cable tether, then it would add stress to the building's frame.  The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure have to be transmitted to the bottom of the building, which was eleven hundred feet below.  The frame would have to be strengthened and modified, and this would cost over sixty thousand dollars.  Nature itself was the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast.  The winds were shifting because of violent air currents on the top of the building.  The back of a dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast.  Lead weights weighted down dirigibles, but they wouldn't be safe at the Empire State Building because there are pedestrians below.  These weights were used for open landing fields.	3	3		3																					
7011	6	When the Empire State building was built they came accross some problems with letting the dirigibles dock there. Some reasons are when the dirigibles were made they werent made to go high. So when the Empire State building went up the dirigible had a slight problem. Most dirigibles that are made out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. But, hydrogen is highly flameable.	1	1		1																					
7012	6	When builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple obstacles. The most important was the issue of safety because the dirigible would cause chaos if it caught on fire. Hydrogen would be too dangerous to use in the dirigible if it could catch fire at any moment.Another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent air currents, and these would shift the position of the dirigible if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast.The last issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height, for it was too close to an urban area. This made it illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were allowed to try before the idea was ruined. Neither could successfully dock, and the idea was finished.	4	3		3																					
7013	6	"Based on the excerpt from @PERSON1's book ""The Empire State Building"", there seems to be two main problems with the docking of dirigibles in New York City. Firsty, is the problem of nature itself. The area around the Empire State Building, and all of @LOCATION3, is just too windy to have a safe docking procedure. The Naval @CAPS1 the Los Angeles attempted to dock, but the operator pulled away for fear of puncturing the zeppelin on the spire of another building. The second problem, though slightly easier to rectify was the law that prohibited any aircraft near the buildings of New York City. This basically made even attempting to dock in illegal. There are many reasons why the idea of zeppelins didn't get off the ground worldwide, and this excerpt about New York was a prime example of the obsticles that couldn't be safely tackled."	3	3		3																					
7016	6	"From the knowledge I gained reading the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" I lerned that there were many obstacles in making a place for dirigibles to dock. The most important reason is safety. Since most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, the dirigibles were highly flammable. If the dirigibles were to ever catch on fire over New York, many lives could be in danger. Another obstacle was the climate. The empire State buildings top where they were going to build the Mooring Mast, had such a bad climate it was nerly impossible to dock a dirigible on it. These are some of the many obstacles the architects had to face when designing the mooring mast."	2	2		2																					
7017	6	Some of the obstacles that builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigables to dock there Were things such as how to dock a dirigible to a bulding, feuling and Service, how to get passengers on and off as safe as possible, they also Should have thought about @CAPS1 a thousand foot dirigible @CAPS2 from the top of the building might do to its structure.The architects and engineers of the empire State building consulted with expert, letting people from the U.S. naval air station take a tour of the equipment and the mooring mast. (Which is the anchor for the dirigible) The passengers of the dirigible could get on and off by walking down a gang plank to an open observation platform.In all, over sixty thousand dollers worth of modifications had to be made to the builings foundation. And some dirigibles couldnt even dock	1	1		1

At the same time the Empire State building is being designer the @ORGANIZATION2 building, also in New York, is finishing construction The @ORGANIZATION2 building workers decide they want to challenge the designers of the Empire State Building by secretly building a 185-foot spire and making their building 46 feet taller. This begins a competition between the designers to see who will win the title of the tallest building. Later on, after the Empire State building is built and wins the title of the tallest building, the workers are trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles the land on. The designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely.

Though this obstacles was able to be overcome, many others were not. Since most dirigibles outside of the @PERSON1 used hydrogen, a very flammable gas, a dirigibles could go down in flames similar to the German Hindenburg, and ""owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been... above...

No dirigible would be allowed even close to the building; however, two still tried but neither could tether safely to the building. The thought of the transportation of the future moved on to airplanes and the Empire State Building's top floors are now a public tourist spot."	3	4		4																					
7029	6	Obstacles are faced everyday, but the builders of the Empire State Building had even harder challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. The reasons as to why dirigible could not dock there were obvious. Most dirigibles use hydrogen, a very flammable elements, to float. If a dirigible caught fire above a densely populated area, like downtown New York, a very serious problem would develope. Another obstacle, being faced, was nature. The winds were constantly shifting because of violent air currents causing the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Lead weights could be used to weigh down the back of the ship, but dangeling these weights above pedestrians is very dangerous. Also, there is a law preventing airships from flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for a dirigible to ever tie up to the building. The idea for making a mooring mast on the Empire State Building was a clever idea, but evidently it was impossible.	3	3		3																					
7031	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were that first, the mast designed to go ontop of the Empire State Building was thought up just to make it the worlds tallest building, not because it was necessary, so alot of problems ar ose. This mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station, which, at the time, blimps were very unsafe, and  lacked a suitable landing area so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off. A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, and took over sixty thousand dollars' to do so. After Construction took place, it was then decided if an incident, such as the Hindenburg occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. But the largest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, due to violent air currents, and although tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, the usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. There was also an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas.	3	3		3																					
7034	6	"Architects based in New York tried very hard to build a successful mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, to dock dirigibles for several hours for refueling or service purposes and to allow passengers on and off the blimp. While building, Architects faced some challenging obstacles that destroyed the chances of the mooring mast to open and become usable. A dirigible moored at the top of the Empire State Building only held by one cable tether would cause tension on the building's frame. The weight and wind pressure would need to be transferred to the buildings foundation. About over @MONEY1 of modifications would need to be made to the buildings framework. Another obstacle was the roof. ""When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place,"" wrote @PERSON1 in her article 'The Mooring Mast.' The greatest obstacle however was nature itself. Violent air currents caused the winds to change nonstop causeing the blimp to swivel around the mooring mast. The only solution would be to weigh down the back of the craft with lead weights, but the risk was to much. Last but not least there was a line New York against airships flying to low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a blimp to even approach the Empire State building. As a result of not being able to use the mooring mast for dirigibles to station, the rooms set aside were turned into the world's highest soda fountain and a tea garden for tourist and sightseers. By the late 1930s dirigibles had become transportation of the past, and airplanes had made their way to the front of the crowd."	3	4		4																					
7036	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building were @CAPS1 with immediate problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The media hardship that they @CAPS1 was placing a mooring mast on top of an already completed building. ""A thousand foot dirigible... would add stress to the building's frame."" (� @NUM1) Not to mention that a large dirigible would also have placed stress on the building. Completing such a project would be extremely difficult because the building was not designed for docking dirigibles. This means the roof and the top floors would need to be converted to accommodate passengers and travel operations. Nature was also an obstacle that builders @CAPS1. High winds could cause the dirigible to violently sway. Weights used to tether the dirigibles could also be a safety hazard in a densley populated area such as @LOCATION1. Fire was another safety concern for the builders. The gases used to keep the dirigibles airborne were highly flammable and would again cause serious concern for safety in a city of millions. Ultimately all of these factors caused the creation of a mooring mast on the Empire State Building to fail."	3	4		4																					
7037	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.       One obstacal the builders faced was the winds on top of the building. The winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though the dirigible were tyed dow to the mass, the ship would swivle around the mooring mass. This would make it unsafe for pedestrians.       Another issue with landing the dirigibles on the Empire State Building was safety. Most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Hydrogen is highly Flammable. When a German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3 owners of the Empire State Building relized that accident would be much worse in down town New York.	3	3		3																					
7038	6	"While building the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One of the first obstacles faced was competition. Al Smith, the governor of New York was determined to have the tallest building in the world, beating the Chrysler building which was also being constructed. This created an obstacle because it put pressure on Al Smith and the builders to makes such a miraculous, tall building.A second obstacle faced by the builders was having to create a successful mooring mast on top of the building that wouldn't harm the structure of the building itself. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame."" Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to the framework.The last obstacle was all the work put into the mooring mast for it to even be able to work. It was dangerous for diringibles to land there. The diringibles were highly flammable. Winds were harsh and unsafe, and there was a law prohibitting the aircraft flying so low."	2	2		2																					
7039	6	The builders of the Empire State faced alot of obstacles well trying to build it. Some of these obstacles was that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single table would add stress to the base of the fame. Also the wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. This would make the back of the ship swivel around. There was alway the thought about how dangerous using hydrogen and helium that were extremely flammable. Those are some of the obstacles the builder face well trying to make Empire State taller.	2	2		2																					
7040	6	The empire State building had to face dangerous condition every day like @CAPS1 winds, heavy lifting, High heights.	1	1		1																					
7041	6	"After reading The mooring mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are evident. The number one reason is because it is not safe. First, most dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. The chance of a fire starting is especially not good because its a highly populated area. Also, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (�@NUM1). With the building being so high,"" winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (�@NUM1). The conclusion has been made the dirigibles land in landing fields because they can be weighted down in the back with lead weights. This method would not be safe if used on the Empire State Building. Clearly, the builders of the Empire State Building are faced with too many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	2		3																					
7042	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The @CAPS1 problem was the issue of safety. Most dirigibles @CAPS2 using highly Flammable gases such as hydrogen. This could be a detrimental problem if the dirigible ever caught fire above New York's public. Another problem was working with nature. There were violent air currents constantly shifting atop the building, causing the back of ships to swivel around the mooring mast. The dirigibles couldn't simply be weighed down in the back, because that would be a safety hazard. The last problem builders faced was the law. At the time, there was an existing law against airships flying too low over cities. To tie up a ship to the Empire State Building would be considered illegal.	3	3		3																					
7043	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many difficulties and obstacles during the process of creating the great building. The creators had planned for it to be the tallest building in existance, but they were thwarted by the engineer of the Chrysler Building. They put a new top onto the building, making it forty-six feet taller than the Empire State. To match these men, Al Smith decided to add a crown of his own to the building. He built a mooring at the 102nd floor that would accommodate dirigible travel. Once it was put in place he needed to make it compatible with the dirigibles. Six thousand dollars were spent to remodel the frame of the building. The also needed to finds safe ways to dock the blimps. They were unable to find ways to extend an electric winch. Balloons were powered by flammable gases too, a safety hazard in a big city. Plus, weights could not be hanging over city streets in order to way down the ship. These problems made the dirigible popularity drop quite alot, so the mooring was never used to its full potential.	3	2		3																					
7047	6	"Everyone would like to jump in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next. Although, there are many challenges the builders faced in attempt to doing so. One of these challenges included the amount of stress the single cable tether from the dirigible would add to the building. Also, wind pressure is a dangerous factor which needed to be taken into consideration, because the dirigible is so heavy, that it could easily fly off and hit someone. The building would also have to be strengthened to hold the dirigible which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. One of the most important reasons against allowing the dirigible to dock there is because it could easily catch on fire."" The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" (para @NUM1) Overall, due to the dangerous factors in allowing the dririgible to dock there, these will always override the pros, and maybe one day technology can create a safe way to do so."	3	3		3																					
7048	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted. One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the airship couldn't moor at the Empire State Building because the winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents. Another obstacle but the builders faced was that there was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for airships if they ever try to approach the area."	2	2		2																					
7052	6	"The main problem of dirigibles landing by the Empire State Building was saftey. For one reason dirigibles were huge; ""Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City."" The Empire State building is @NUM1 ft tall. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" If a dirigible was going to land on a very windy day it had the potential of crashing into other buildings which would cut through the dirigibles materials. Also on the tethering to the mooring mast, would... ""weigh down in the back with lead weights..."" the idea was dangerous. To hold the dirigible to the building there would be lead weights, ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Due to all these problems the dirigible would never be safe to land on the mooring mast was the problems that the builders faced."	3	3		3																					
7053	6	"There were many reasons that the mooring mast couldn't be used. The first reason is wind speeds. In fact ""in 1930, the @ORGANIZATION1 dirigible, Los Angeles, approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 the dirigibles could not even get close enough to dock. Another reason was safety. In 1937 the German dirigible, Hindenburg, went down because of a fire. That situation could've been a lot worse if they dirigible went down on heavily populated areas, in which thousands of people might die. The last reason is that there is a law prohibiting airships flying too low over urban are urban areas. Therefore it would be illegal for a dirigible to get close enough to dock."	3	3		3																					
7054	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced several obstacles throughout the building procedure. First, many of the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen gas rather than helium and ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1 following the German dirigle Hindenburg, Empire State Building owners ""realize how much worse the accident could have been,"" and this resulted in the decision not to utilize the mast as a docking area. Also, when Al Smith decided to build the additional mooring mast onto the top of the building, due to the weight of the docking blimps, the architects had to invest ""over @MONEY1"" to modify the building's framework and enable it to support the weight of a dangling blimp @CAPS2, due to violent winds, the docking dirigibles could not properly land and ""were constantly shifting."" Lead weights couldn't be used because of the dangers and impracticalities the idea could set on the @LOCATION1 below. Finally, it seems that the overall safety and practicality of the mooring mast weren't easily attainable. Al Smith states himself that the engineers are ""trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement. Hence, the builders of the Empire State experienced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building."	4	3		4																					
7055	6	"The ability to dock dirigibles atop the Empire State Building, while initially lucrative, had major obstacles. The problems facing the development of the mooring mast would be cost, flammability of dirigibles, and weather over @NUM1 feet in the air. The structural and cost problems facing Al Smith was that ""The stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" In order to overcome this obstacle, ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and... over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications would have to be made."" This is problematic because Al Smith now must spend more time and money than originally planned. Furthermore, another problem is that ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a huge obstacle because a fire or explosion ""above a densely populated areas such as downtown New York"", would be catastrophic and could put thousands of people in harms way. Finally the weather at the top of the Empire State building is unsuitable for docking dirigibles: ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This is dangerous to the structure of the building, surrounding buildings, and people close by. Due to these problems, Al Smith and the engineers could not complete the Mooring Mast."	4	3		4																					
7056	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on it. These obstacles took precaution of safety, nature itself, and the law. The first obstacle was one of safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Owners of the Empire State Building realized that if a dirigible was destroyed by fire, it would cause a huge accident. Also, this accident would be devastating because it'd take place over the densely populated area of downtown New York. In addition, ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles that are moored in open fields use weights to be weighed down. Yet, these can't be used on top of the Empire State Building because they'd be dangling about walking pedestrians which is dangerous. Lastly, a major obstacle faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building was the ""existing law against airships to fly too low over urban areas."" @CAPS1, this would make it illegal for a ship to tie to the building or even approach the area. Overall, the obstacles faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building lead to the disappearance of this idea altogether."	4	4		4																					
7057	6	Builders of the empire state building faced many different things while trying to build a dock for the dirigibles. The builders had to make sure it was safe to walk on the platform to get off the blimps. Also the dock had to be high so the owner could still keep the world's highest building record. But with a little hat added wasn't going to do much so building a dock was a better idea.	1	1		1																					
7059	6	"Based on the excerpt, the morning mast there were @CAPS1 obstacals builders faced attempting to allow dirigibles to @CAPS2 on the empile state Building. Building a @NUM1 ft tall building was hard adding a Mast Would be even harder. Allowing a dirigible land and on the empire State building would be dangerous. The german dirigible the @CAPS3 Was destroyed causeing @CAPS4 of damage. ""The owners of the empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been If It had taken Place above a densely Populated area Such as down town"". There fore The mast was Put up but never was used as a dirigible @CAPS2."	2	1		2																					
7061	6	The obsticals that the @CAPS1 had with docking the Dirigibles were that even though they would be tied up in the front. The back end would still swivel in the wind. They couldn't put little waits on the back because if they ever fell they would @CAPS2 podestriens. And there was a law past ships couldnt dock on Building or even come close to rural areas. That is some of the obsticals the workers faced.	1	2		2																					
7064	6	The architects of the mooring mast were blind to the amount of problems that could have arisen. Balloons are not very strong and if they didn't already know, it's windy on the top of the empire state building. The wind Could drive the drigible right into its spikey doom. They had no real way of keeping the drigible contained because usually lead blocks held it down. From 102 stories in the air, that wasn't the safest plan. Also, most non-@CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium. In a crowded New York City, a fireball like that would be devastating due to hydrogen being highly flammable. The builders really should have planned this out better.	3	3		3																					
7067	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" That was struggle number one, a thousand-foot drigible would add too much stress to the frame. ""The stress of the drigibles load and as the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" That was another obstacle the builder's had to overcome considering the foundation was eleven hundred feet below. The Empire State building then had to be strengthened and modified in order to build a stronger foundation for the mooring of a drigible upon the Empire State Building. Those were some of the many obstacles the builder's went through in designing the mast."	3	3		3																					
7068	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" there were some obsticales that the builders faced. Some of the obsticales that were faced had to do with the strength of the frame. The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast to top the the buildings flat roof because it would stress the frame to much. So over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had been made to the buildings frame work. Anothe obsticae the mooring mast was never destined to fulfill its purpose."	1	1		1																					
7071	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. Because it was held by a Single Cable tether that would add Stress to the buildings frame. Another obstacle was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the Building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.

Overall, this cost over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications.	2	1		2																					
7074	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles. One of those obstacles was making sure that blimps and other air born transportations didnt interfer with the building. Also another obstacle the builders had to deal with was making sure the docking areas were safe. Because if a blimp go to close to an urban city like @CAPS1.Y and have all thos flamable fuels leak out. It would be a big disaster. These are the obstacles the builders faced."	1	1		1																					
7078	6	The builders faced many problems that should have been foreseen. Perhaps the greatest reason was because @CAPS1 dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium as their gas choice. Because hydrogen is highly flammable it would have spelled doom for New York if exploded. The weather also created a great risk. If a dirigible dock there the violent air currents would shifted constantly. The use of lead weights would put pedestrians at risk. That idea was neither safe or practical. Probably one of the most obvious risks was the law. There was a law that stated that airships can fly to low over urban areas. Because of these reasons it made making the Empire State Building a landing area unsafe.	3	3		3																					
7080	6	"There were many obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First off as stated in para graph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot drigible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the buildings frame."" This shows an obstacle because in order to enable this to happen, over @MONEY1 of funds would be needed. The funds leading to the stregthing and modification of the steel frame. Thus needing to redo the fundamental building blocks of the operation. Second the greatest concern was safety. This is brought to hand because most drigibles are very flammable. They consist of Helium, which is a extremly flammable gas. Also if the drigible were to mount to the top of the Empire State Building, the back of it would be swaying around and around. This possibly having a chance of dis-mounting and it crashing into a densly populated area of people. These are some reasons that the obstacles of attempting to allow drigibles to dock on the top of the empire state building."	3	3		3																					
7081	6	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One such obstacle that the builders had overcome was the law that prevented airships (i.e. plains or dirigibles) from flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM1, we learn that ""[this law] would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Another obstacle the building crew of the Empire State Building was faced with when constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Because of the violent wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew constantly changed, causing a great difficulty for any dirigible to connect to the mast properly. In paragraph @NUM2, we are told about how if it were possible to connect the mast to a dirigible that the back would swing. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe."" Because there were too many obstacles with not enough safe options, the mooring mast project were shut down; proving that during its construction its builders were faced with too many obstacles."	3	3		3																					
7085	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles such as safety, nature, and law in their attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. The issue of safety became apparent because most dirigibles made outside of the @LOCATION1 were made with highly flammable hydrogen rather than helium. To risk the destruction of one atop such a bustling city would be devastating. Nature too became a problem in the futile attempt of the builders. With such ""Violent air currents"" (� @NUM1), the dirigible would swivel around even if it were tied up to the mooring mast. Finally, law was an obstacle to the builders. Existing legislation banned airships from ""flying too low over urban areas"" (� @NUM2), meaning the dirigibles would have no way of landing atop the urban building. obstacles such as safety, nature, and law hindered be attempt of allowing dirigibles to land on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
7086	6	In the @CAPS1, the docking of dirigibles had many issues. One, boarding passengers would be very difficult as the dirigible will @CAPS2 from a gust of wind. Second, the gases used to make afloat are highly flammable, and explode quite easily.	1	1		1																					
7087	6	"The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to have dirigibles dock there. First off, it was a huge safety issue; ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen... hydrogen is highly flamible"" (paragraph @NUM1) if an accident happened (lets say to the magnitude of the Hindenburg) over New York City, thousands of people could die because of this highly flamible substance. Secondly a very large problem was to successfully use the mooring mast. ""The winds at the top of the building work constantly shifting due to air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). If the wind was out of controll and the dirigible wasn't tied down right, the harsh winds could be dangerously dangeling over the people of New York. Amongst many other reasons and the use of common sense, it is clear that the construction of this mooring mast should never have ever been thought of as a reality."	2	2		2																					
7089	6	The builders and architects of the Empire State Building faced many problems trying to dock dirigibles at the top. The first problem was that there were very strong winds near the top of the building, which made it extremely hard for a captain to control their ship. When anchored to the mast by a single tether, the dirigible would be twisted around the spire by the winds, making it nearly impossible to transfer passengers. Another important issue that builders could not overcome was the fact that the streets below the Empire State Building were densely populated. This meant that a disaster similar to the Hindenburg tragedy in New Jersey could cause many more casualties in New York City. Lastly, one of the most obvious obstacles that the builders could not get past was the existing law against airships flying over urban areas. This law made it illegal to fly a dirigible at a height that would be necessary for docking on the mast of the Empire State Building. With these obstacles in their way, the builders of the Empire State Building could most likely never accomplished their dream of docking dirigibles on the mast. 	2	3		3																					
7090	6	"An obstacle the builders of the Empire State building @CAPS1 was weight.

The story says ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was Nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

Another obstacle was nature itself. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.""

It would not have been @CAPS2 to land a dirigible there because the text is saying the winds at that height were not stable and that the ship would be tossing and turning in the air. Another obstacle the @CAPS1 faced was the law of airships flying to low to the ground. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.

Thus no dirigibles have successfully docked there, and none ever will."	3	3		3																					
7094	6	"Dirigibles are large steel-frame balloons enclosed by cotton and filled with hydrogen and helium. In the early 1930's, the new idea came about that the dirigibles would dock at the top of the Empire State Building in New York.

The author notes, ""the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The wings on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". The dirigibles would constantly be moving and shifting. The author also states, ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

7095	6	The builders of the Empire State building had numerous obstacles in their way if they planned on allowing dirigibles to dock there. The first and most serious problem was the safety of the passengers as well as pedestrians on the street below. Dirigibles are filled with hydrogen which is highly flammable. In 1937 in New Jersey the dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This catastrophe would have been worse if it were take place over the heads of people in New York city.Nature also posed a huge threat to the completion of the docking mast. Due to the air currents on the top of the building the blimp (dirigible) would constantly be shifting. The only way to control the swaying of the blimp would be to use weights to hold the blimp down, which would again put the public at risk.Along with natural hazards it would have been illegal for the blimps to dock at the Empire State building because of an existing law. The idea to allow dirigibles to dock at a mooring mast atop the Empire State Building is completely impractical.	4	3		3																					
7096	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there like nature, law, and of the sharp spire. Nature was proably the biggest problem because you can't control wind.

Law was also a problem. There was a law that prevented ""... airships flying too low over urban areas."" The spire at the top of the building was sharp enough to pop the dirigibles that flew over it.
