1	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The features of the setting that affect the cyclist is the lact of information on were to go and the lack of water. This was a problem because he needed water for his trip and directions on were to go.  	1	1		1																					
2	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way. He was in the desert, which is dry and hot. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). Also, the  temperature was hot and made every thing around him hot, �brackish water faling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Since he was in the desert, there was no escape from the sun. The text  states, �The sun was beginning to beat down�(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The cyclist was all alone in the road with none around him either so into he passed out, no one could help him. � and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgous day in June�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town� but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town."" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). Thesettings that the cyclist was riding in wasn't good ones and so they negativly affected him; causing him to be dehydrated and tiredin the end."	2	2		2																					
3	3	Everyone travels to unfamiliar places. Sometimes we get lost and ask locals for directions which @MONTH1 not be a good idea. The setting affected the cyclist. He had a perfectly good map but asked older men who look like they haven�t been out in ages. The old men apparently haven�t been out because they gave the cyclist the wrong directions.  My advice would be to not listen to anyone no matter their age if you have a perfectly good map with you. Also try to know where you are going at all times. �Yes, sir!	1	1		1																					
4	3	I believe the features of the cyclist affected him because he was impatient and trustworthy he tock the old mens advice to take an hr of his time bay taking a short cat, if he would of stayed true to the mep he wouldn�t of almost ared of heat but his impatientress got the best of him so he took the shortcut. After his experence he new haes to stat ?? to the mep and not trust people who havent seen changes in the last few years.  	1	1		1																					
5	3	The setting effects the cyclist because of the setting were diffrent the story would not of made sense. The setting of the story is not and dry with scaterd ghost towns. When he reaches the first �town� he sees �One ramshackle sheds several rusty pumps and a coral that couldnt hold the lamesh mule.� If the setting had the problem of no water so there would be no conflict in the story, �In the story the speeker says �I was travling through the high deserts of California� that are very hot and dry, and he says �This causes the problem of it being hot and dry if the seting was a forest in @DATE1 he wouldn�t have as much of a problem needing water which would of made the story much less exciting.	2	2		2																					
6	3	There were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. For instance, it was extremely hot and dry. Also it  was nearly deserted, almost all of the places he crossed were deserted .A  lost her features of the setting were a ram shackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that caldnt hald in the lamest move.an is the feature give you an idea if haw the cyclist feels.  	1	1		1																					
7	3	The cyclist was riding through a tower when he stopped for directions. These old men told him to take a short cut and he did and got lost. He was in a ghost town in the desert. In conclusion the desert is hot.	1	1		1																					
8	3	The affects of the cyclist is if it does not change. it cut hurt a lot of people feeling because they @CAPS1 don�t care about the cyclist. I�m one of them people who does not care about it cause it does not affect me or anyone I know. It is a big deal to write people, some of them @CAPS1 blow stuff up. They talking on tiv and on the radio making all this stuff they say is made up. I don�t believe to I see it. That @CAPS1 not for black people because it has not did anything to us. We really don�t care about the affects of the cyclist.	0	0		0																					
9	3	The essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� describes a man�s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man�s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� As you can see the setting makes this man�s bikeride very hard.	2	2		2																					
10	3	In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� written by Joe Kurmaskie, represents how certain conditions can affect a cyclist. The cyclist was biking through the desert to reach Yosemite National Park, but on his journey he accoutered many tough conditions to make it difficult to get there. First of all, the desert was very hot which makes travel very difficult. For example the text states, �the sun was beginning to beat down.� @CAPS1 makes any task difficult because the sun drain�s a person�s energy. Secondly, the trip was very long so the cyclist had a hard time conserving water. For instance, the man drank so much water, he almost ran out; �The water bottle contained only dehydration which can cause death. Joe Kurmaskie�s story, �Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� represents how certain conditions of an environment can affect a cyclist.  	2	3		3																					
11	3	The setting of the authors � shortcut� effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well.� Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills.� The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views.� I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill.� The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said, � success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts.� I believe that @PERSON2 agrees.	3	2		3																					
12	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist very much so! The cyclist is riding through the hot desert. Meaning he needs lots of cold water to keep him hydrated. The longer he rides in the hot sun, the more he sweats, the more likely he will get dehydrated. If he was riding in the rain or snow it could possibly slow him down also, because he would be cold and his muscles might get stiff and not be able to move as fast. This is why the setting affects the cyclist very much so. 	1	1		1																					
13	3	"There was many features that affected the cyclist such as heat and lack of water. The cyclist was drinking a lot of water throughout the story and ends up only having little water left. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� That shows he wasn�t prepared with enough water for his trip to Yosemite. Without water he/she would die from the heat. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke"" This states that he @CAPS1 the danger of not having enough water in his system. Features such as water and heat affected him/her throughout the story. Not having enough water could make him/her lose more sweat and the heat is making him lose even more sweat which can cause extreme heatstroke."	3	2		3																					
14	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Initially, when the cyclist went through the road with the big snake in the middle of it made him keep cations and very unease. Furthermore, the desert and nothing around gave the cyclist of abandoness and no help for when he is I trouble. Finally, the cyclist is greatly relieved when he sees the bait store and that people are there. The features in the setting greatly affected the cyclist on his ride.	1	2		2																					
15	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by Joe kurmaksie,greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided.The old cotagers told him about a path they thought was right,but was hard and did not get him to the right place.The features of the setting are described as �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.�	1	1		1																					
16	3	In the essay Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the author Joe Kurmaskie uses the features of the setting to affect the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by these features because of he sees the same setting (the dessert) for several miles, he has no water and, the road has a lot of hills. The cyclist could been affected by seeing the dessert and no scenary changes for a wahile. When you look at one same scene for hours you could start to get tired and bored with everything. So this cause him to be very drossy and bored. Also the cyclist had no water as none of the fountains were cold water. Having no water out in the dessert could make you dehydrate and faint.	1	2		2																					
17	3	Many different characteristics in a setting and determine the outcome of an event there. Im the story, Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the cyclists journey was affected my a few weather relouded things. The heat was an extreme thing that showed him down and in most cases detened him from reading his maximum level of ability. Also the time of your in which this labes place, greatly affects the cyclist. Lastly, the type of road and amount of ground that he has to cover after affects his performance. Overall, setting can be a determining factor in a journey as they life	2	2		2																					
18	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. Since he is riding in the California desert, he always feels very hot and is always in constant thirst. In addition to this the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate. He finds nothing but old abondored buildings. He doesn't find anyone. No people or cars, or any sign of modern civilization. This causes him to feel a little unnerved as if something happened to him nobody would know about it. This is especially prevelent when he become dehydrated. In those ways, the cyclist is very much affected by the setting.	2	2		2																					
19	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� by @PERSON1, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way the setting affects the cyclist is, in the desert, the cyclist drank more water than before. For example, the text states �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. You will drink more water in a desert than in a forest. If you go cycling, be aware of the settings around you because they will affect you.	1	1		1																					
20	3	"Some features of the setting affect the cyclist. First the cyclist followed the old codgers advice of how to get to Yosemite National Park. Their advice was no use and didnt help her in the end. Next, �a tarlike substance oozed out� of what she thoot was going to be water. Then the terrain changed to �short, rolling hills�, which wasnt helping, her bike better. Lastly, ""tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�, slowed her down. All of these road blocks in the setting affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
21	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the lack of water, out of date information, and rolling hills. If he had up to date information then he would probably have got water from a town that�s not empty or almost empty like a �ghost town� as the cyclist said.	2	1		2																					
22	3	The cyclist has a couple things if he racing and the wind is blowing then theres a problem and he has to follow traffic law and ride on the right side or the road.	0	1		1																					
23	3	�Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� had a  rough setting between harzardous things and the death defying heat. The cyclist had to endure the pain of dehydration and determination. He had been given bad directions that almost caused him his life. He was travelling through a desert and claimed the temperature was @NUM1.Also, the cyclist had to ration his water because it was ghost towns in which our character passed through. He used nature skills he�d once learned and began to suck on pebbles which take the mind off thirst and uses saliva to help refresh your throat. Throughout his adventure everything kept this young man from getting water and to whenever there was water any faster. He had survived and wouldn�t ever take shortcuts again	2	2		2																					
24	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the lock of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. He frind the water but e tar like substance come out and it tasted like battery. When he left he had to go through rough road which he couldn�t travel that fast leanes of the condition of the road.	1	1		1																					
25	3	"The cyclist had a very hard time geting to Yosemite National Park. This is because the sun was out, and it was in the middle of June. I was so hot out the cyclist became dehydrated faster than he would have on a cooler day. When the pumped the handle of the old rusted water pump, he said the water felt, �somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. The cyclist also had to deal with a lot of ""short rolling hills"", which was much more difficult to bike on than flat roads. On top of everything else the roads were in very bad condition, so you had to watch for rocks in the road."	2	2		2																					
26	3	The cyclist in the story is at first confident in accepting the old men�s help, and doesn�t seem to suspect anything is wrong when he first starts out. The way the men directed him seem all going for his water supply is all in store, and the first land mark, a ghost town now, is exactly where it is supposed to be. The next �town� he hits doesn�t have anything that could replenish his diminishing water supply and he starts to feel troubled. However he was told the next town wasn�t further, so he pressed on. Then the scenery makes a drastic change, the flat roads becoming hills, the sun beating hotter- it really look like a desert after tumbleweeds even go past! The cyclist continues on, despite being very dehydrated. The next thing to come along is an old juice building that almost seems to mark him on how he has no water. He keeps on, however, and at last sees a shop where he can get water. The canging scenery sends the cyclist from confidence to worry, to hopelessness and lastly, relief.	3	3		3																					
27	3	Well I would put it like this is that the weather had everything to do with it because the not weather make you tired and upset and easy to angre so now it make you upset and and then stress.	1	1		1																					
28	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in two way. This ways are pysical and mental. The pysical ways that features affect cyclist is the terrain. If the roads are long and wiredy, this could wear the cyclist out. They could also become physically tired if the incline of the hill is to steep. When it�s you against gravity, it can be egausting. The temperature can also be a crusal factor in a cyclist pysical ability. Nobody want to feel like their in a sauna when they are bike riding. The cyclist and also be attracted mentally. If the terrain looks deserted or anything like a desert the byciclist instintaniously thinks �dehydration� and �death.� If some people see dead animals or bones they would think they could die. If they see vulture circling them they would get afraid and think death, but the worse thing of all is that knowing all of these things are in the same place at the same time. This is how setting affects cyclists	3	2		3																					
29	3	The settings of the story were grveling. While the cyclist was riding along, the sun was beginning to beat down on him. The cyclist began to sweat due to the heat and thus he drank just about all of his water. Now the cyclist was experiencing major heat, sweat, and dehydration. The California desert is a grveling place to be, especially in June. Luckily, the cyclist did come up to a camp and found fresh food and water, before he would eventually continue his way to Yosemite National Park	2	2		2																					
30	3	As the cyclist is travelling to Yosemite National Park, he comes across many features in the area that affects him. First, he takes directions from some old guys who don�t know anything about the changes in maps because they never leave their porch. At first, it affects him in a positive way, because he thought he had a good shortcut to Yosemite. However, the affect later came negative because it turned out to be a shortcut that never existed. Another feature that affected him wasted the setting which was a desert-like area. The heat made it harder for him to ride his bike, and he also drank a lot of his water. This later resulted in him becoming dehydrated. A positive affect was when he found the bait shop, where he rehydrated himself and got some new directions.	2	3		3																					
31	3	The features of this setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting is a dessert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated. And when he is on his low of water because it is dry into mouth gets drys. @CAPS2 because he is in the dessert he sees wild sometime dangerous animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously @CAPS1 diamondbrock snake, which I believe are venomous, @CAPS2 �because � of the extreme heat of the dessert he realizes that he had ??? chance of dropping from heatstroke. @CAPS2 the writer said that the dessert had short rolling hills and rough road ahead ??? would leave worn the cyclist out. Because of this terrain the cyclist way affects.	1	1		1																					
32	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One example is the hot sun that was beating down on him made him very thirsty. Another feature is the rough road that wore the cyclist out and made him tired. My last example is the old juice factory with the picture of a refreshing cup of juice on it made the cyclist feel like giving up because he thought he would die of dehydration. These are my reasons as to why the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways.   	1	1		1																					
33	3	In the essay the mshan writes of rough rodes timit the cyclist�s had to overcome to reach @CAPS1 gole.	1	1		1																					
34	3	Understanding, realitic, mode-all are reason�s how setting affects the setting. If a book has a good setting then the book might be pretty good. When you have a setting it�s more understable of what they are trying today. And if you have a good setting it makes it more realitic So when you read it you wont be thrown off, the mode of the story sets it all off, because usually books have there ups and downs. That�s why they chase the mode.  	0	0		0																					
35	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by making him dehydrated which could lead to a heatstroke. �I could drop from a heatstroke� this shows that it was hot out and he was feeling bad if he could have dropped from a heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
36	3	"The terrain during the cyclist�s journey greatly affects him. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing. The author stated, �I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� This shows that he was energized and happy. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, especially because he had no water left. The cyclist said, �sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn.  This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are include, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did. "	3	2		3																					
37	3	The features in the story great effect the cyclist. One feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the heat. At first, the story says that the pine trees cooled the cyclist, but eventually the forest turned into a desert, and the heat poured down on him, make it hard to cycle. Another feature that effected the cyclist was the lack of water. As he moved away from his beginning point, the cyclist was drinking lots of water. But when he needed to refill, the water was brown and hot, so the cyclist didn�t take any. The lack of water plus the heat formed one giant obstacle that potentialy could have killed him, but through great determination the cyclist got through this troubling time.	2	2		2																					
38	3	The narrator in this story goes through a tough journey insisting of hope, challenge physical pain, despair, and relief. All of these are further developed by the settings where they take place, For example after taking advice from old men at a campsite, he is on his way through the deserts of California. If he had been almost anywhere else, his journey could have been much better. He could have gotten more reliable advice, or had been in a place where the towns were not miles and miles apart. Also, at one point he reaches a snake on the road. This could symbolize a decision, which was to go and how it will affect the outcome of his trip, or perhaps the decisions he had already made. To take advice from strangers and better yet he should use it. The irony continues as he becomes dehydrated and the flat land turns hilly. If that weren�t to happen he could have been more successful and healthy on his trip. The setting in this men�s story are necessary for if to have plot line and have the humour it possesses. If he were in the city, for example, he would not get lost and stranded, and therefore would have no story.	3	2		3																					
39	3	The setting in the story changes many times. It starts in an area with rivers and pine trees. Then the cyclist arrives ant a town. After that he is pounded by the hot sun and along hilly road. With not much water left the cyclist uses all the energy he had to get to a town where he could get something to drink. The setting was what made the cyclists journey a hard one.	1	1		1																					
40	3	The features of the settings affect in the story �Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit� it is the morning and everyone is still sleep and he wakes in the morning for something to do when he pull up to the first plase he thinks that they are all old and crazy and he thinking that the places needs fixing because the houses are falling apart. Then..leaves and see these wide bunch of hills. inconclusion I would never do all the riding he did.  	1	2		2																					
41	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the desert with no water and doesnt know where he is going. The old men on the porch gave him wrong directions now he is lost in the desert. The cyclist find the will power to keep on moving and he finds help along the way. He finds another old man there that offer him directions but he says he has a map	1	1		1																					
42	3	The setting in the story discouraged the biker very much. As he follows the advice of the elderly men and starts off his journey he notices that there is, �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� He uses tone words to describe how had things are when he says, �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He describes in exhaust how hard his journey is getting. He describes the intense heat inthe desert of California, pedaling up, � one long, crippling hill.� The terrain did not make his rideeasy at all. The factor of weather, rolling hills, and the shortage of water take a tall on him. If he were on flat terrain on a cool day then he would have been first fine.	2	2		2																					
43	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty. The bumpy roods and hills make him work harder. The abandoned places make him lose hope. If faced with these obstacles I would have been affected in the same way. As I believe any human would be.	1	2		2																					
44	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist.The features of the setting, or nature, affect the cyclist because they are wearing her out. The cyclist is going to the city of of yosemite but some guys gave her a short cut. Through this shortcut are hills and heat and lack of water. @CAPS1 describes this by saying, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited.� @CAPS1 is excited that there is a building that @CAPS1 might get some water from. Also, @CAPS1 wiped the sweat from her eyes meaning it is hot outside and @CAPS1 is sweating and losing water. Therefore, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
45	3	The three most important features of the setting that effect the cyclist are the ground he is traveling, the towns he passes, and the availability of water. The ground the cyclist is riding over is important because the rougher the terrain, and the more hills there are, the more energy he must use, and the less distance he can travel. @PERSON1 is riding fine until he must travel the rolling hills which consume his energy, ehausts his water, and causes dividing hope. As he approaches towns, his hope increases but soon fades due to the realization that the town will be unable of giving him relief. When he pumps out water that tastes like �battery acid,� his hope once again diminishes. As he sees the bait and tackle shop, he knows he can make it there and that when he gets there he can recover. These three features are what effects the cyclist the most.	2	2		2																					
46	3	In the story of �rough road ahead :do not exceed posted limit� the setting affected the cyclist. In the middle of the desert during the summer the cyclist was low on water. The old men gave him the wrong directions, so mainly it is the old guys thought he dies. The cyclist survives but the heat and the season he was riding he�ll probably bring another water botlle nextime	1	1		1																					
47	3	Some of the features of the setting affect the cyclist like the road was bad it had bumps all over that made it much harder and it also took up a lot of strength. Also the neighborhood of two hundre degrees after that become to a road with arore bunch of hills	1	1		1																					
48	3	"In the story many different settings affected the author in many different ways. In the very beginning of his journey he came across a ghost town. He reacted to the features of this setting with humor and hope. �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" He still has hope that he would end up safe and in the right place. The next setting was an abandoned shed with a water pump and a fork in the rode. He grew worried when he saw that no near town was still in sight. �This sight was troubling� when the features of the next setting caught his eye he was desperate and devastated. �At some point, tumble weed crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� He was on rough terrain in the middle of the desert with little water, when he reached the abandoned @CAPS1�s factory all his hope was lost and when he was planning his death. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean."" @CAPS2, when he reached the fish camp, he was relieved ""I had overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, Kiss them and buy some bait.� He was overjoyed and overwhelmed because he had survived.    "	3	3		3																					
49	3	Ghost towns are not exactly the most inviting place for a cyclis trunning low on water supply. In �Rough road ahead: do not exceed speed limit� the cyclist is affected in many ways by his surrounding settings. Starting off on a warm day with the sun bright start off as a good thing, while his mood is still fresh and happy expressions play on his face. But as he moves on he speaks of how �The sun was beginning to beat down� expressing his remorse of listening to the old men that led him on their �shortcut.� Along the road he comes to his first let-down, a ghost town with �one ramshackle shop, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest male.� @CAPS1 he tries to pump the water from the corral but gets a �battery-acid� flavor and is forced to continue onward with little left to drink. This affects his mood to pity for himself and anger at the men who put him into the predicament. By the end he is relieved though when he comes to GARY & @CAPS2 FISH CAMP, a place with a working sink full of cold water. He says he �had an overwhelming urge to seek out @ORGANIZATION1, kiss them and buy some bait.� His thankfulness is expressed to men he doesn�t even know but because they were the light at the end of his long, dark and very exhausting tunnel.	3	3		3																					
50	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. It was hard arrived at the first town for author. For example �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The road that author was ridding, it was rough. @CAPS1 example is �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� All the road was hills and rough. Than �The water bottle contained only a few tontalizing sips.� @CAPS1 doesn�t have that much water. That was really hard.	2	1		2																					
51	3	The features of the selling effect the cyclist a lot. One factor that would effect the cyclist would be the heat. Also, because of this factor, he�s pobably suffering from lack of water. He�s probably really hot seeing he�s the only one cut in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles. Another feature of the setting that would probably effect the cyclist is the thought of there @MONTH1 be a car around this next turn. If he can�t see around the next turn he doesn�t know is coming. The cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up.	1	1		1																					
52	3	The setting puts a great deal of stress on the cyclist. The biggest issue he faces is the weather. He is a cyclist �traveling through the high deserts of @LOCATION1 in June.� He had been riding his bike all day and he was soon going to run out of water. Just when he thought he could drink more water, he drank �water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� The weather being so hot and humid, did not help the cyclist throughout his journey. Another factor of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� is a main problem the cyclist faced. These changes in terrain played into the fact that the weather did not cooperate. The hills made the cyclist work harder therefore use more energy. Luckily the terrain had a positive affect on the cyclist as well. The stones he found on the ground, helped keep his mind off the thirst. There were many factors of the setting that negatively and positively affected the cyclist throughout his adventure.	3	2		3																					
53	3	The narration of �Rough Road ahead� a solo cyclist encounters several challenges throughout the story. The changes in his environment directly affect the completion of his journey and his health. As the narrator makes his way to Yosemite national park from the none of the old men his first encounter with his environment acknowledges his deserve and need for water. The text states �I had been huting my water pretty regularly... the high deserts of California in June�. To disappointed the truck stop�s water supply from the pumps was not adequate for his concumption, only forcing him to link elsewhere to quench his thirst next, he explenced rolling hills by exsercising more energy he made his way now everyone still in need of water. His spend lost his quickness as thoughts of his crippling dyhydration distracted him. He wer came his challenges making his was to a bate shop as the heat beat him unmercifully. The change in his environment challenged his heath and created a obstraction that nearly deterred him from his goal.	3	2		3																					
54	3	The setting affected the cyclist a lot. One way was the heat. It got so hot that he was becoming dehydrated. He kept drinking his water, until he didnt have any left. Another reason is because the road turned into hills which made him use more energy. Finally, it didn't help that he hadnt seen any sign of living creatures except for a snake @CAPS1 how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
55	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the main character the cyclist. The cyclist is biking �through the high desert of california in June.� So naturally it can be infereal that it is not and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases �a tarlike substance followed by brackish water� he is runningout of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that �l cald drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service causing more anxiousness and dispare l have had an experience similar to this where l wat out walking in a state park in the @DATE1. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow covered trees made me feel at if I�d never be warm again similar to He cyclist who�s environment made him feel hes wald die of dehydration. So, as can be seen. He setting of this short story affects the cyclist.   	3	3		3																					
56	3	The settings that affected the cyclist were in fact ones you don�t want to be near when you are out of water and tired from pedaling. The time and place affected him greatly because there wasn�t a cool breeze in the air in June at California. He was in the middle of flat deserts and had no sense of where the part as and where civilization too so he can get some water. The quote �old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office� helped you realize taking advice of direction from old people who don�t go anywhere is a bad idea. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills�. This quote shows you some terrail features that affected the cyclist. Furthermore, the cyclist realivingly found civilization with running water.	2	2		2																					
57	3	"In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit""  the author Joe Kurmaskie tells you that there many things you have to go through before you get there. The example is when ""he stops and asks for directions to Yosemite state park"". Because he did what to get lost. When he had to and other towns. The next example is when he came to a rock in the road:  And had to get water form a old rusted pump because he had really no water left in his water bottle"	1	1		1																					
58	3	"I think the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the terrain �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills� this shows that he is a warm and trobled by the change of the terrain. He also fells alone �I toiled on at some point tumbleweed crossed my path� he also. Though he was in a ghost town. �Summer time� rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my detorating brain"" he felt that he was slowly dying. He also though he was losing it, the sun had a great impact on him because he wiped his face to make sure he was no seeing a mirage. But through it all he had hopes the author also wants us to have hope and keep on going even though things dont look good keep moving foward never look back and alway's be positive and take advanage of your surrounding. This is the message the author tries to give"	2	2		2																					
59	3	Heat, dry, flat - all are features of the setting that effected the cyclist. As the cyclist was driving through the desert, he noticed how hot it was, and how he would become dehydrated quickley. I was also very dry and and he started to get nervous about how thirsty he was. The flat ground models how there is nothing around that can help the cyclist, which made him scared. The story also metions that he is a ghost town	2	2		2																					
60	3	The features of the setting effects the cyclist by the way that the auther started talking and how he sound at the beginning of the story. When they both at the picture he looks like hes cecilla ssing and then ceoos. To the story and goo continue ties reads. It doesn�t sound like he is enjoying his ride, because of the niuse he was down on the bumpy roads, sparkes, and the bor of counter tirst he doesn�t have. hes sacting time and sec from add perso doesn�t mic at all because there could hou old �timers and don�t know once thou are tailoring around her, to save, to goo shouldn�t take advice from them because goo could end its line this nidsnes transitin califend doesn�t and how feres how could now do it, to let some or therefore so be dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
61	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie there were many things that effected the cyclist. Such as the water. He had no really good water to drink because of where he was''. When I tryed a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid''. He wasnt able to drink the water because the battery acid'' that was in it could have made him very sick. Also the unstable roads that he had to bike through made things hard. ''Rough roads ahead'' To ride on unstable ground can be very hard to do. So just these two examples, the water and Rough roads made the features of the setting deffinitly effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
62	3	In the essay � Rough Road Ahead Do Not exede posted speed him if many of the featutres of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist goes by river wich he wount find later in the journey.As he goes along in the journey the heat and lack of water starts to affect him. Also he finds a water fountain that pours hot water with the flavor that has long since been shut down. The cyclist is affected by many features of the setting.	1	1		1																					
63	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because the roads are too rough. If he gos too pot he could spin out of commission and the water was trouble. He sad �when I tried a deep or two it had the flavor of a battery acid.	2	1		2																					
64	3	The cyclist is mostly affected by his lack of water. In the beginning of his ride the cyclist is confident and is striving to reach the joys of @LOCATION1. He longs for, �the cool pines and rushing rivers�� (@NUM1). Later on when the cyclist reaches the rough terrain, he starts feeling exhaustion as he depletes his water supply. A bit of relief later comes upon him after a long climb over a hill until he sees a shut down juice factory almost seeming like it was put there to tease him. His destination fills him with relief and pride, knowing that he would survive the strenuous journey.	2	2		2																					
65	3	The setting effected the cyclist in a great way. The snakes blocked his pathways, and hi short water supply made it hard to continue. He felt as if he could drop of a heatstroke. His environment, and the information from the old man made his ride very hard to continue. All in all, his settings had a big effect on him.	1	1		1																					
66	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the rode conditions. The rode was all messed up. 	1	2		2																					
67	3	The cyclist was well prepaired for his adventure however hot enuff for a change in senary. When the old men told him to take a difficult path and did his in tire setting changed for the worst. After this he was nearly over powered by devastating hills and dehydration was slowly creeping up on him as well. He had not nearly packed enuff water or supplies for a change such as that and he would regret it later. The Hills were steep and endless, and the sun was hot and mercilous mankind it even worse on him. This is how the change of setting affected the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
68	3	Setting can affect anyone and everyone, in this case it happened to be a cyclist. Since it was June, it happened to be pretty not outside causing the cyclist to lose more body fluid due to his constant movement producing sweat. This makes water a must have. Also, as he passes through, he comes across a sign that read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED @CAPS1. Since the road was harder to drive on, riding a bike across it isn�t much easier. Anothe way the setting affected the cyclist was the snake that blocked the road, which he thought of to be a diamondback.	1	1		1																					
69	3	The features of setting  really effects the cyclist because of the condition. For example, the weather, it is hot, it will slow the person down. And if it�s perfect that will let the person go at regular speed. And the roads, if the road is bumpy that will slow them down. And if its smooth that will speed them up. See, it really does depend on the condition.	1	1		1																					
70	3	"The setting affects the  author alot. First he is in a California desert in the middle of June. It is very hot out. This makes the cyclist very tired. There are some cool pines, but they do help much. There is also no where to get water for a very long time. The narration states, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). With no water the cyclist was dehydrated. This hurt his biking skills like balance and led stregth. Finally there was no one around for most of the story. The cyclist did not know how far he had to go until he reached @CAPS1 or water. There was also no one  to help him if he were to have a heat stroke."	1	1		1																					
71	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist traveled miles on a bike dealing with the weather in the deserts, little bit of water, and being tired. The cyclist faced many hard times trying to travel on a bicycle from one point to another.	1	1		1																					
72	3	The setting of this story greatly affects the cyclist�s attitude and adversities. The path of the cyclist is through California deserts, which are dry and hot. This first presents the major conflict of the story, the danger of the cyclist getting heatstake. In the reading, the author says, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly� If the setting was in a cooler climate, the author would most likely not drank as often, and would not face dehydration. The trip would not have been as dangerous for the cyclist if the climate was different. Another element of the setting that affected the cyclist was the terrain. In the reading it says, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The rough road not only would take a toil on the authors body, but also his mind. While riding, the author thinks, � I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph� This shows how his attitude is getting less and less optimistic as well as keeping his mind on his thirst. Thinking of his thirst would only get him more thirsty. The small change in terrain had a large impact on the authors journey. Perhaps the most influential element of the setting is the isolation. Only until the end of the story does the cyclist run into another human. Up until that point, He was all alone, having to deal with his thirst and fatigue on his own. If the setting had been in a more urbanized area, the cyclist could have gotten help from other people, which would have made his ordeal very easy. Also known, that nobody was going to help him played a large role in the mental state of the author. In conclusion, the conflict of this story was set up by the setting. If the setting were not hot, rough, and isolated, the cyclist would have had an easy journey, and the story would not have been as exciting or interesting. A different setting in my opinion would have ruined the story.	3	3		3																					
73	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist was going through the desert, it had be dry old, dirty ��. I came to a fork of sorts, One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the largest mule greeted me. This side was troubling. �when she wanted to us the rusty water pump farlike substance oozed out and the water seem like to be @NUM1 degrees. �Not two miles into this next section of ride, I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. �This made it more difficult for the cyclist to ride the bike. This would make the cyclist more tired. As the cyclist moved on it was getting more tire and his water supply was going down. It was try me to keep his balance while he kept riding	1	1		1																					
74	3	How the setting of the place effects the cyclist is for one its to dry a cyclist would be ridy for haurst shouldn�t be in a place that�s dry.Like in the story it says �I was travelling through the high parts of California in June� meaning it was really hot and dry.Second would be the animals there dangerous.A cyclist should be riding in a place with diamond back snakes it says in the text �I toiled on.At some point,tumbleweeds crossed my path t a ridiculously larger skilt it really did look like adiamond back� which if it really has one would be really dangerous  & cyclist should not be riding in that type of dangerous places no matter what type there are.That is how the settings of the surrandings effect the cyclist & how can it�s a bad place for them to ride.	2	2		2																					
75	3	The features of the setting affect the cylceist by the ground would change terrian a lot makeing it difficult to ride at the same speed the entire way. Also, the lack of water made it hard to focus. I think the features of the setting affect the cycleist by people think they are worse than the actually are.	1	1		1																					
76	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The setting affects the cyclist because the weather is very hot and humid which makes him sweat which is using up energy because his body is trying to stay cool. Also the setting affects the cyclist because there is no water so on top of sweating being out of energy he has no water to refuel his body which makes it very hard for him to keep going.	1	1		1																					
77	3	In this story the cyclist is going through a desert of California. This is a reason why he is very limited on water supply. It is really hot which would cause him to drink a lot more water. He had started his journey in the morning so that the sun wasn�t as hot as it would be in the middle of the day. Then it started to get a lot more sonny. So with the sun comes more heat. The rider says �The sun was beginning to beat down.� This would help the readers realize what time a day it was and how hot it was. This was in the morning so he didn�t realize it but as it got into the afternoon he realized it and started to get dehydrated. 	2	2		2																					
78	3	The wonderful features and settings had a dramatic affect on the author. The affect was bad rather that good. First, there was the almost unbearable heat. The author had limited amount of water and used a lot of it because of the smoltering temperatures. Another feature that had a great impeidence on the author�s well being would be the lack of water in the pumps he stumbed across at the snack. Lastly would be the tar-like substance that came out of the pump when author tried to get water. There was also Brackish water in the that tasted suspiciously like Battery acid.	1	1		1																					
79	3	"The cyclist is traveling through a rough part of California during the hot month of June. The author describes part of part of his journey; ""I was traveling through the high deserts of california in june."" The heat of the sun and not much water around is causing the cyclist to worry about his health. A little further into his journey realizes how bad he could get if he doesn't find water soon. The author write, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke. ""As the cyclist has run out of water & there is no sign of life around, he begins to feel that he @MONTH1 never make it through the desert to yosemite National Park.The author describes this ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. ""The setting of the cyclist""s journey greatly affected how he percieved his journey."	3	3		3																					
80	3	The features of the setting affect to cyclist because of where he is. The biker is in a campground in California. By saying that one could sense it is a dusty place. Also, when the story says that the �town� had been abandoned. This also tells us that the place the cyclist is in is a diserted place without many people or places to stop. The story also talks about a snake in the road. A snake in the road tells one that the town is desireted I could tell that this �town� is deserted because around here, people do not goin towns that don`t have buildings. It a snake was in the road, then the town must be empty because around here streets are busy and no snakes in the road.	2	1		2																					
81	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over, �short rolling hills,� and arround a,�ridiculously large snake,� and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut. So yes the author is affected by the setting	1	1		1																					
82	3	The affects of the features around them affect them by the hot bikes so the bikers need water and also it affects them by the roads are so hill so they can�t just road. Stight so they need to go over the hilles and that affects them because cycles are very hard to land form a jump.	1	1		1																					
83	3	"The features of the setting in Yosemite give the cyclist something in look forward to, but the feature of the sorting that he is in enduse in get there causes him despaire. As soon as the cyclist passes a ghost town and notices swettering hed of the sun during early endeavers of the trip he checks himself up as he says,""I brely noticed it [the sun], the cool pines and rushing hills of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Although the cyclist began to feel the toll that the trip and the sun was going to take on him, he erased the morning with the hope and bealy of arriving at Yosemite. The more the cyclist noticedthe sun the more he drank untill his water supply seemed low, striping as an old rusty water pump he had hope of being replenished but the taste of bitter battery acid caused the cyclist to stop drinking. The rolling hills, Sun and tumbleweds did nothing to quech the cyclist thirst or at least divert his assertion. If the cyclists was to see a sign that said Yosemite @NUM1 miles away his spirits would have risen, instead he saw a sign that said, �Rough Road Ahead� which did nothing to help him. If the terrain was more poporsed, easier to travel on and in plenty supply of water, the tune of this passive would be more hoped instead in such despair, the features of the setting caused the cyclist grief instead of hope."	3	3		3																					
84	3	 The bike rider in the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by @PERSON1, is greatly affected by the condition of land around him. He is riding through the extremely dry desert and is running, low on water. However since it is such a dry place he can�t find any. Also since it is out in the middle of no where, there is no one he can ask for some. If this story was set somewhere else he wouldn�t have has either problems.	1	1		1																					
85	3	"In ""rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Many visual features create a very deserted area thats hott in your head. For example in paragraph five they use alot of adjectives to describe how abandon the place was. Words like ramshackle and rusty. Also how often the lack of water was brung up made us think of how hott this California desert must have been. Also the heat made the cyclist belive he was seeing a miracle when he saw the Welch�s fruit juice factory. The choice of visual words in this story are words to describe what affected the cyclist."	1	2		2																					
86	3	In the passage,the cyclist had about @NUM1 different settings. One of these settings were the rough terrains he had to pass through where he lacked on the amount of water.Another setting the cyclist had to go through was the hill like terrains.Where he was laughing at himself for taking the old men advice in the first place.Both of these features had a great a tall on the cyclist body strength and his spirit. But with confidence, determination, and the relief of the success he was able to overcome the obstacles.	2	2		2																					
87	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, �Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.�	2	2		2																					
88	3	The setting in the features of the cyclist is that if it is too hot or too cold, it could affect how the cyclist is riding . If it�s to hot the cyclist would get exhausted a lot faster . And if it�s to cold then the cyclist would @MONTH1 be get sick . Also if it�s  too windy then he would go a lot slower if he is going in the wind�s direction.	1	1		1																					
89	3	The features that affected the cyclist was plenty of things. One thing would be lack of water. In the text he said the pump gave water that taste like battery acid. Another one would be all the surroundings changed from what the old men sald and he got lost. When he was lost he had to have determination to find someone say that he could survive.   	1	1		1																					
90	3	The setting and it`s features affect the cyclist greatly. He is in the desert and all the town's are abandoned. Also he now hits a sign that says �Rough Road Ahead�(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1). This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up, old, beaten roads. And he has the sun beating down and is almost out of water.	2	1		2																					
91	3	The features of the setting affect the the cyclist by giving him obstacles to overcome when he had to go down the winding hills, he would have to slow down so he could manuver the hills and not lose control of the bike. The heat he was facing would cause tiredness and dehydration. If exposed to the sun and heat long enough you can get a sunburn or suffer a heat stroke. A heat stroke can be fatal to anyone, especially those with heart problems. Dehydration also can be fatal. If the cyclist does not see any buildings, he would not be able to tell where he is and he might get lost because of it. Getting lost will also lead to dehydration, tiredness, and heat stroke.	1	2		2																					
92	3	The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
93	3	In 'Rough @CAPS1 Ahead' the features of the setting and the cyclist�s surroundings greatly influence him. Because he is in �the high deserts of California in June,� the climate is hot, dry, and miserable. Another feature of the setting that affects the cyclist, is that he is out in the middle of nowhere. There are no other human beings, cars or buildings for miles. Also, the terrain affects the biker. When the road starts to get bumpy and uneven, it causes him to exhaust his water supply even faster. Overall, the cyclist in this story is greatly affected by his surroundings.	2	2		2																					
94	3	In the short story the cyclist was affected by the setting in many ways. The author was running out of water throughout the whole story. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� There was a limited amount of water in the bottles. He had to travel a long distance. �Not two miles into the next section.� He was getting tired quick. Also the terrain was not good. �I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� It get harder and harder to continue his ride.	2	2		2																					
95	3	The cyclist was so set on seeing cool, piney trees and lakes, that when he saw dirt, snake, and no source of civilization worried him. More affectively, what he didn�t see scared him most. He did see windy rivers or trails hidden beneath all kinds of trees. He didn�t see any people or friendly little forest critters. Instead he just saw the same rusty color of dirt and the occasional snake. His mood was affected and he started to lose confidence and hope. He wasn't used to the new surroundings and for a while doubted if he could even make it out alive. When he came across the run-down building of Welch�s factory, he was even more distraught. Fortunately, he did find civilization when he came to a fishing supply shop. This definetly boosted his spirits. Once he had saved his thirst problem and assured himself he has alive and would luckily stay that way, he sat down before wading out again in search of his destination.	2	1		2																					
96	3	The features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist. He�s in California in June, and it�s very hot. It�s pretty much a desert. When he stops for water, the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops. Also, the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid. So this is not very good for the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
97	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the �resevoir compground� he�s feeling pretty good because he�s just leaving �the serenity of an early-summer evening and he�s headed toward �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� He�s in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he�s anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the �ghost town� and the �sun was beginning to beat down� he�s less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, he�s still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once �a thriving little spot.� Next, when the cyclist comes to �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral� he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a �tarlike substance� so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the �rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake� it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom� and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better. 	3	3		3																					
98	3	There are @NUM1 features of the setting that affects the cyclist on his journey. There is a lack of water, in the middle of nowhere, and nobody�s there. Due to lack of water, this feature really affects the cyclist. He will need water in all to move and get through his journey. Water is the main thing he should have. He could end up getting dehydrated and might cause him to die right in the middle of the street. Therefore water is one feature that affects the cyclist.  Furthermore he�s in the middle of nowhere. There is no buildings or nothing around, not even gas stations so where it is can stop and if he had money he would be able to buy about @NUM2 or @NUM3 bottles of water and maybe even a few snacks. That is another feature that will affect him. Lastly nobody�s around town in able to help him out or anything. Let�s say that he gets lost and he�ll need direction to get wherever he�s going well there�s nobody around in able to help him get around or anything. In conclusion those are the @NUM1 main features that will defentily affect the cyclist. 	1	2		2																					
99	3	The settings affect the cyclists for many reasons. One, if the setting is nice, the rider can concentrate on the scenery not on only pain they are having. also, if the setting isn�t very nice, the rider would probably concentrate more on the pain than they would the scenery. another thing is if the setting is very hilly & the rider has to drive over it, it @MONTH1 not feel the greatest. The cyclist would get even more pain than before plus the cyclist could could get dehydrated faster, the setting really does affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
100	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The cyclist also had a lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map.	2	2		2																					
101	3	"In the text, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. For example, the text states, �There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.� This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch�s Grape Juice factory� This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited. Lastly, the text states, �GRAPE AND @CAPS1�S FISH CAMP� The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. The setting�s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."	2	3		3																					
102	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist�s ride longer and harder than he expected. When the cyclist first headed out the road was flat and smooth. Halfway through his trip the �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The cyclist continues to pedel even though he was slowed down to 12 mph. The hills made the ride slower and harder because of the hills. Tuoards the end of the hills he had to make it �Over on long, crippling hill�. The word �crippling� is used to show the phisical affect that the hill had on him. The hills were a feature of the setting which made the cyclist�s ride longer, harder, and more phisically demanding.	1	2		2																					
103	3	There are numerous features in the setting that effect the cycleist. For example  the rough road. A nother example is the tumble weed and the snake also affected the cyclist. In conclusion those are the reasons the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
104	3	Sun, amount of miles, people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot. Also, he said that he really didn�t seem to notice it through in his mind it affected the cyclist. Next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept,	1	1		1																					
105	3	The setting is like a desert with no water or people civilizations anywhere around him. This make him more worried because if he dies know one will know for days or weeks probably.	1	1		1																					
106	3	There are several features that the cyclist encountered, and all of them affected the cyclist. For example, �several rusty bumps,� is a quote of the text explaining that he wasn�t riding on smooth ground he was riding on rough, hard, bumpy ground. Also he had a huge lack of water he was water depleted he couldn�t even go the speed limit, he was going 12 mph, he could have been going 55 mph. �Rough roads ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit,''  this is another quote expressing the dangers in the ride that he was risking. All these things made the cyclist uncomfortable, dehidrated, and very tired.	3	2		3																					
107	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonist�s problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June, � and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because � The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.� @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. 	3	3		3																					
108	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is hard to go far on a bike when the place, you are ridding is dry, abandoned, a quiet, hot cold and straight forward. It tells you that the setting is abandoned when if says �there was none in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind"". This would make it hard for a cycler because you need a good water supply and thats hard to keep when there is nothing around."	1	1		1																					
109	3	The cyclist choose to take an old abandoned route to @LOCATION1. The route had in some places no buildings at all to see making the cyclist loss hope of his need for water. Until the end there was no one on the route making him all alone. So if something happen who would know. During his adventure he ran out of water making him dehydrated that didn�t help. The setting of the story seems tragic to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
110	3	"The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. The text says, �The sun was beginning to beat down�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The hot sun was making the cyclist sweat. He was losing water. This was making him dehadrayted faster. The text says. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The hills the cyclist had to ride up were wearing him out. He was getting tierd faster. The text says. �I stubled into a rather modern in bathroom and drank deeply from the sink"" (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The modern bathroom had good, cold water. This allowed the cylist to drink from it. The water replenished the cyclist allowing him to regain some of his strength. Then the cyclist could carry on."	2	2		2																					
111	3	In the eassy �DO NOT Exceed posted speed limit,� It is a clear cut for survival as it seems that this man is fighting to stay alive. As l know cyclists pedal for hours at a time and sometimes for hundreds of miles of he was biking where green grass and cool mountains collide the tone and mood of the essay would of beam completely different.He uses sentences such as �� of two hundred degrees, deteriorating brain, birds would pick me up clean and drop from heatstroke.� @CAPS1 all make me want to read further in the essay to see lf he will be ok by thes end of his journey? I know what the feeling is when you are low of fluids because l have chronic dehydrated. I couldn�t imagine biking and only seeing desert hiss and passing tumble weed. It sounds like an awful experience. If he were somewhere cooler and colorful his experience wouldnt of been so horrific.	3	3		3																					
112	3	There are many ways that the setting affected the cyclist. One way is in the story when it says that it was very hot, he could become dehydrated and could possibly have a heat stroke, also the rodes were windy. This could be a problem because hes tired so he might not be able to go around the turns, he might just keep going straight and then get lost even more. That is all about how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	1		1																					
113	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" affect the cyclist. First of all, the weather causes most of his problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a california desert in June the temperature had to be in the @NUM1's. This causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly"" The heat therefore causes the cyclist to drive excessively and run out of water, also, the objects the cyclsit comes across on his journey affect him. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This saves the biker progress and most likely scared him. The cyclsit is greatly affected by the features in the story setting."	2	3		3																					
114	3	The cyclist was affected by the heat. The fact was June , hes in the desert and has low on water were what almost lead to his own down fall. This hot desert setting sounds hostile and am I�m surprised he lived and that he was that lucky.	1	1		1																					
115	3	The features of the setting had misled the cyclist. When he had first left the town where the old men adviced him cyclist had high hopes as a looked and senery enjoyed seeing very ? of the struggle.	1	1		1																					
116	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a large way. He has a hard time going on his journey. He began to lose hope, get tired, and began to think he was going to die. The settings played the biggest role. It was very hot with no people or buildings around him. He had very little water and no place to get anymore. He then encountered a large snake which made it worse because he was in fear with no one around to help him. If he would have followed his own directions instead of the old men he would not have had this problem. The setting around him really made his trip a hard one with no water, people, towns, or buildings around him.	1	1		1																					
117	3	"The features of the setting in the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� greatly affected the cyclist. In the beginning of this man�s journey he was confident in his abilities. �I rode in the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.�  The cyclist was prepared for an exciting day and the setting supported this feeling. ""The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" @CAPS1, as the setting began to change and his water ran out, the cyclist's attitude changed. He was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June� without much water and begun to feel desperate. As more and more abandoned buildings and deserted towns appeared he went into despair. �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake - it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� He was in the middle of nowhere with no one around and because of this setting he lost hope of surviving. He thought he was going to die of heat stroke, not having any water left, on these short rolling hills and under the extremelyly hot sun. The cyclist was affected by the features of the setting, going from confidence, to desperation and despair, and then to relief, the changes in setting caused his change in attitude throughout this journey. "	3	3		3																					
118	3	"The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, �affect  the cyclist in major ways. First, when the cyclist sees the grape juice factory, he is reminded that he is out of water and is doubtful about even living. The text states, ��A young   pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung  my head �   (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). The  text later states, "" At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..."" (kurmaskie). This tells that the cyclist feels de pressed and is majorly affected by these sights. This could and would later ruin his self esteem and think about diying."	2	2		2																					
119	3	The cyclist went on a rough journey and he was explaning how tiering it was and difficult it was for him going from town to town having to diel with lack of water poisonous snakes and the condition of the road.	1	1		1																					
120	3	The setting of the essay didn�t really help the author at all on his journey. There were not many structures on the way. Either that, of the towns said to be, �a ghost town.� @CAPS1 this couldn�t have reassured the author that things were going his way. It also was very hot during his journey. The author says he is �traveling through the deserts of California in June.� Deserts are very hot places and June is during summer which is the hottest month so it had to have been extremely hot and humid. @CAPS1 all this must have taken a toll because he never really saw anything reassuring until the last town he reached with the bait store. So the setting definitely had to have affected his confidence and his energy levels.	3	2		3																					
121	3	The features that set the affect of the cyclist is very clear in case of this essay which resene when it @CAPS1 the signs  that said �Rough @CAPS2 ahead: Do not Exceed posted Speed Limit.� That had to slow down his bike. �Then he said that their were no building or cars nowhere	1	1		1																					
122	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the essay, it states, �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.� This statement might affect the cyclist in the way that, they fear if they get into any trouble there is no one around to help out. This statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way. In the essay, it states, �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral they couldn�t had in the larger mule greeted me.� This statement simply gives the cyclist the impression that this particular town is juice, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, @MONTH1 be decades. The different features of the journey of the cyclist in the essay, many would fear the outcome,if they over fear the journey and turned �old timers� who had never left their porches, in order to experience such things.         	1	2		2																					
123	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because, forty miles into the desert, I arrived at the fisrt �toun�. The setting of the desert affected the cyclilst because the cyclist, because cyclist was arising doun the road when the men with the settings came and affected the cyclist. The man was very crazy. Her water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of driead sweat circled my shirt, and ?? he ?? that should drop from heatsroke on a gorqeas day in june simply because I listened to some gentleman who were it been off their ??? ???, ??? to tough. This my responese to the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
124	3	The cyclist trusted a man that didn`t know much about the world, he thought that the guy would know how to get to the place he was looking for. The cyclist took his advice, he thought that he would be there really soon so he start to drink his water really fast. He realized that he was out of water and the park he was going to wasen�t anywhere near. The cyclist got frustrated and angry he was now crossing the desert which was making him tiered and dehydrated. He pased this road that was a rough road with tumbleweeds and snakes he kept on going until he sow the �@CAPS1 Juice� company. He hurried there, went into the bathroom drank same water. When he got out an old men asked if he needed directions, the cyclist said no.	2	2		2																					
125	3	"During the passage �Do not exceed speed limit�, the cyclist endures many hardships. One of those countless hardships was the setting that he was in. while he was lost, thirsty, and exhausted, he remained all the while in �The high deserts of California in June�. This shows that the temperature most of been unbearable. This would cause the cyclist to tire out and dehydrate faster than usual. Also, the surface he was riding on had many steep hills, as it is said when he says �over one long, crippling hill,� This shows that the hills took a lot of energy to get up. And finally, the author says that �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" This shows that if he needed help, there was no one around to lend him a hand. That is how the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way."	2	2		2																					
126	3	It affects the cyclist because in the begging talk�s ablut the old man. Italso talks about basically saying there information is out of aase also in other words should have just followed his map in the first place.	1	1		1																					
127	3	"In the stories, don�t exceed posted speed limit, there are some very descriptive settings. In the stories these settings have a great effect on the cyclist. Through these our settings the effects change. Some good effects some harsh effects. The first setting that is described do you is, ""the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them."" This setting gives you a vivid picture of were the cyclist is heading. This setting also establishes a happy sort of mood. Let the pretty picture is about to change. Not so much further in to the cyclist ride he noticed a change of terrain,"" flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is short on water, and is becoming very tyered. Seeing this just crushes his spirit. @CAPS1 riding hills hard, but ridding hills with our knowing of something good waiting for you on the other side of the hills. Both of these, very different settings gives off very different feeling. The first one makes you think he is going to have as easy enjoy able bike ride. But this all changes when he hit those horrible hills. Just the thought of having so ride over miles of hills, makes your legs hurt. Over all the features of the setting saposed an intense bike ride for the cyclist, followed by a reward by beautiful place.      "	3	3		3																					
128	3	The author had to bike through extremely hot weather. This made him feel sweat a lot. The narration states, �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt� (@NUM1). This caused him to drink water until he ran out. The narration states, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips� (@NUM1). He then had to suck on pebbles which he could have choked on. The narration states, �With any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat�(@NUM1).	1	1		1																					
129	3	In the story �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The most challenging problem faced  by the author was the lack of water. � I pumped that handle for several minutes but the water wouldn�t calm down nor I tried a drip or two,it had the flaver of beatterly acid.When @CAPS2 set out for the next train @CAPS2 came to a road that read �Rough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. The tarrain got more bumpy & hard to cross. The effected the determination the cyclist had left @CAPS2 the regreted not listening to the old men of didn�t think they knew what they were talking about. Due to the fact they never left their porches. As you can see the setting most deffinated effected the cyclist in physical or mental ways.	2	2		2																					
130	3	"The features of the setting affects he cyclist. One way it affect the cyclist is it by being hotlike a says in the text""I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgerous day in June ""@CAPS1 way it affects the cyclist by being bumby like it says in the text ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" that is how the setting affects the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
131	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the mood the cyclist and what happens as he journeys in the desert to a town. For example his mood changes when the old man asks him for a map and his attitude changes by cautiousness of the new, of the new road he went on then terror when he thought he was gonna die � I was gonna die and the birds would pick me clean� then to pride when the old man asks for a map and the author says �I own a very good map� But as he journeys to Yosemite the setting changes when he goes to a  desert type of place then goes a bait shop to rest. Then probably on his merry way to his destination.	2	2		2																					
132	3	'Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie demonstrated that the features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. First off, the cyclist was in the desert on a bicycle. This affected her because if they had been in a car, or on a bus alot less energy would have been used up. Secondly, the cyclist started running out of water. This setting didn�t help because they were on a bike so that kept them hydrated. Another setting that affected the plot was the deserted towns. If they hadn�t been deserted everything would have been better. These features affected the cyclist a great deal.	1	2		2																					
133	3	The features of the setting affects the cycles such that it was affecting his altermmation to continue. For example, after @NUM1 miles he looked upon the �ramshackeled sched, several rusty bumps and the corral� This sight troubled me. In the desert his water tasted like the flavor of �battery acid.� It also goes on to say that it was a �test for my inner spirit.� It also states that he went along with a few drops of water through the tumbleweeds. This passage shows obstacles he had to go through in which he did and made it with a little confidence. Although his situation was somewhat unbearable he still kept striving on.	2	2		2																					
134	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in most of the story. The heat made him hot & thirsty while the travel gave him a lack of energy and even     of a need for water. In paragraph @NUM1 the writer says one of the hills was �long and a               � The hill was wearing him out & draining what was left of his energy. The setting of the story was the biggest party if the road was flat and bumpy while the tempeture was	1	1		1																					
135	3	The setting easily can affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in which the cyclist was in the seemed to be abandoned which doesn�t give a well thinking to this person . If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won�t be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly infront of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist. The conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him.	3	3		3																					
136	3	The different settings that the cyclist had to ??? were mountains or hills winding roads and California desert in June. As well as he was running out of water.	1	1		1																					
137	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist by taking and not had the right setting. The features are just not right and and they could be changed around a little bit and still have about the same meaning of the essay. So I think they should change it around.	1	2		2																					
138	3	The features of the setting have an affect on the cyclist. He is going on this bike ride through the deserts of �california in June. This obviously is going to have an affect on him because it will be very fast. At one point he says, �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed.� @CAPS1, the setting of having all these ghost towns was troubling to him because no one else was around and he was beggining to rum out of water.  The weather outside was starting to get to him, and he said, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� When your petalling through the desert on a hot day it is going to have effects on you. If he was in a different setting this felling of despair would not be      in the story. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
139	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Ti�s better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing what�s going to happen next.	1	1		1																					
140	3	As the features changed in the setting it becomes harder for the cyclist .At first the cyclist stoned off pretty easy .He had plat smooth roads to go through .He started out before the sun could to him.� The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite my name written all it �He kept his mind off the sun and this helped him .Then, he got to a highway that made it kind of harder .I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills �So he had to pedal harder and would tire him faster.� At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path. Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state �.By the tumble weeds that means he was in the desert during a hot period of time .So he had little water left and he was becoming dehydrated .This was a hard task for him to overcome .By the terrain changing it become harder for him.	3	2		3																					
141	3	The setting in this short story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� is a hot, sunny desert, in which all towns have been abandoned, �The sun was beginning to beat down� (@NUM1) � i arrived at the first town it fit the defination of a ghost town (@NUM1) trational. The cyclist at this point is not, tired and worried about the lack of water. The setting and cyclist�s state run side by side.	1	1		1																					
142	3	In the story there are many affects the cyclist deals with. He has to go through a lot of bad things just to finish. The cyclist has to watch out for a rough road he was going over. Also the whole time he was racing he had to watch out for diamond back snackes. Also the whole race, the cyclist biggest problem was water. He ran out quickly. And when he saw the factory and stopped. He put rocks in his mouth to make him forget about water, and lets yours split circulate. The cyclist had to go through all these problems which made it show that he had determination.	2	2		2																					
143	3	The features of the setting greatly  effected the cyclist.  He was  riding along   on a  route he had little confidence would end up anywhere. That being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework. The temperature was very hot, where was little shade, the   sun was beating down on him. The route was very discouraging .all the cyclist wanted wanted   was water and the route kept touenting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that approved to be an old bottling factory for Welch�s  grape  juice. The cyclist would appear  to be closing in on something to drink, but be left with nothing.	3	2		3																					
144	3	During the cyclist bike ride the unbearable conditions changed his attitude when he firsts starts the reader can sense frustration because of the old timers and there directions. Then as he realizes that he might have enough water his attitude changes. The cyclist goes from frustrated to loving the secenery, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,� as the conditions changed to even more unbearable heat. He decided to just give up. Until he got courage and �slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� When he saw Gary and Wilber�s fish camp, he realized he was safe.	2	2		2																					
145	3	The byciclist from �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit� was effected in many ways from the environment. The most talked about feature in the environment was the lack of water. The byciclist was going to die because there was no water and he was really dehydrated. Another feature was the heat. It was really hotwhere the narrator was bycicling. When @CAPS1 hot, the heat dehydrates you. So the narrator was being pushed to the limit because of the heat. Also, everyone was gone from the towns so every town he came to was hauntinghim until he got mad at the lodgers hetalked to and was really frustrated. The smooth flat road gave way to rolling hills, which made it harder for him to ride. Lastly, the snake inthe road affected him because he had to avoid it. All of these things affected him. 	2	0		3																					
146	3	�Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie is truly a story of man against nature. Here is a man who is completely alone except for his bike, the baron landscape and relentless sun. First he notices the sun, over head him, expected from California June, but not none the less. Then next come the rolling hills and incline in elevation, going up hill means his body working, harder, and burning calories and his much needed water supply. Then there is the man much torture. A speed limit of @NUM1,were he is going a tough 12. And worse a billboard of �a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,� this truly hit his emotions, showing him exactly what it was out of reach. In this story every element of his surrounding contributed to his hoplessness.	2	3		3																					
147	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by one, the conditions of the road were awful. Two, the cyclist said there was a huge snake blocking his path as well as the occasional tumble weed. The biggest affect on the cyclist was the lack of water with unbearable heat and he was tired. Those are the affects the features of the setting had on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
148	3	"If I had a choice to ride a bike in California or vermont, it would be a no-brairer to bike in vermont. The temperature in vermont would be much cooler than in California. In the story the cyclist comlains about the ""wide rings of dried sweat"" and the possibility of heatstroke. It is proven that when temperatures rise, you tend to lose more water from your body. Had the cyclist gone to a cooler site at a different time of year he wouldn't have struggled with dehydration on his bike ride. "	1	1		1																					
149	3	The features of the setting in the story affected the cyclist a lot. In the morning when he began his trip, he was eager and determined to get to his destination. Although it took him forty miles to get   the first �town�, he didn�t seem to mind. �The cool pires and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them,� is what crossed his mind once the sun began to beat down. Meaning that he   didn�t mind or wasn�t   troubled   by it  at the time. But the farther his trip went, the hotter, and less water supply he had left. Once he passed a couple of �troubling sights�, because they were abandoned and no one   was around, he began to worry. The cyclist got to the point that he stated to suck on pebbtes, in order to circulate the last spit he had in his mouth. In his desperation he finally saw a sign for hope that gave him strength in order to continue on. When he arrived at GARY AND @CAPS1�S FISH CAMP,  his   emotions, and mind changed from begin lugubvious, to becoming thankful.	3	3		3																					
150	3	During his cycling trip, the author had to endure extreme heat, face snakes, deal with little or no shade and survive a dire lack of water, all problems related to the setting of Yosemite National Park. The author, cyclist Joe Kurmaskie, writes of becoming dehydrated, and describes, �the sun was beginning to beat down and l was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 struggle for him was crossing the path of a �ridiculously large snake� and �trying to keep his balance in his dehydrates state. Kurmaskie ran out of water, due to the extreme heat, and upon reaching a water pump, finds the water to be unfit for drinking and �in the neighborhood of zoo degrees.� @CAPS1 setting-related issue for kurmaskie was the fact the area seemed deserted and he had to continue for mile until he was able to find a spot with clean water where he could rest and rehydrate.	3	2		3																					
151	3	The features of the setting were very affective in the story �@CAPS1�t exceed @CAPS2 Speed Limit.� It affected the cyclist because in one part of the setting it went to roling hills. That�s going to be hard to pedal a bike on. Another was the setting affected the cyclist is at one point tumbleweeds were in his way. If the gets caught on the bike it could have caused him to fall and it could harm him. Lastly, the road started getting rough up ahead which could be hard to ride over potholes and thugs like that. Therefore, the setting was affecting to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
152	3	The features of the setting keep affecting the cyclist because first its hopeful then he relizes its hopeless. He was laughting when people told him the right directions and now �It was sad, hopeless laught, mind you, but at least I still had energy to feel bad for self.� said the cyclist when he was refering back to the first town. The reason this affect the cyclist is at first he was going good then he got thirsty and bad things happened.  thats how it affect th cyclist.	1	1		1																					
153	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the author in many ways. One feature was the hills. The speed limit affected the author because he felt that he was moving to slow. In the story when it says �I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1,� is evidence of this	1	1		1																					
154	3	This is how the setting effects the cyclist. One is the hot dry California desert heat. It was making him hot and thirsty which was making him low on water. The hot desert heat had made water a for like a substance which he could not drink from the well. The water bottle only containe a few tentalizing sips which was not enough to quench his thirst. The hot heat that would make birds pick him drys all of those examples make it hard for the reader to take the old timers advice. It made him realice that in time comes wisely and youth can make silly mistakes. The heat had made it only a trip for his inner soul to survive. That is ho the setting effects the cyclest.	3	3		3																					
155	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist mainly because he was in a desert. There were no stores, no rivers or lakes, it was very hot, the roads were long and there were even snakes on the road. It made it harder for him because he didn�t have much water to drink.	1	1		1																					
156	3	Many features in the setting affect the cyclist. Several main features include the cars lading town. that aint really towns anymore, and the water pump. Both of these examples gave him hope but none gave him relief. The town he first saw could give him water, but it was all run down and weakened. �I arrived at the first �town�. This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time... refer the @NUM1 word war.� He is saying that the town could�ve given him more water and enery, but it appeared that it was over for this town. Additionally, he biked across a water pump that was well needed He tried to pump water but got no success. �I pumped the handle for several minutes but the water wouldn�t cool down.� A working water pump would�ve been huge for him giving him more strength to bike. However, once again it was very misleading	2	2		2																					
157	3	This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� That changes the effect because by saying that it will show how tired he is going to be or the work trying to make it over the hills. Another example would be �high deserts of California in June.� That�s saying its hot outside and very tiring. I think it means that because in California its really hot and in June the �summer time� its very tiring. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  	1	2		2																					
158	3	The features affect the cyclist because of how the road is made. If the road is a downhill ride the cyclist might ride faster. The road might be up the hill so he @MONTH1 go slow. There could be a possibility that the road might have bump rocks or grass on it that could be something tough to ride through. So the affect of the cyclist is depending on how the roads are made.	1	1		1																					
159	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the worst the features get the more he wants water. For example, in the essay it said at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculous large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me when I think of tumbleweeds I think of dryness because it is like dry grass and when I think of snakes I think of heat because that is the time for snakes to come out when ot gets hot. So the cyclist was thinking about dryness of his throat and the dryness of his sorrounding making him want water. Another feature is when he seen a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth probably making the cyclist wishing he could have that cold refreshing drink.	2	2		2																					
160	3	In �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the cyclists was effected by the features of the setting. She was first effected by the old men which told her a �shortcut� to her ride to Yosemite National Park. Then she was effected by a ghost towns which had no water to give her. Then she was almost dehydrated when she came to a rickety road which had a few tumbleweed and a huge snake which was quite difficult to get by. Then at the end she came upon �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� where she decided to make decisions herself. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist in a negative way except �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� which saved her from dehydration.	2	2		2																					
161	3	In the short story, �Rough Road Ahead�, the cyclist faced with many problems. One of these is the feature of setting. I believe it has a big affect. The setting is in a dessert, which is very hot, there is no water around and usually nobody lives in a dessert. @CAPS1 thing is that he was running out of water. In the text it says, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1 setting of the book that affects the cyclist is that it is in June. June is a very hot month, especially when the cyclist is in a dessert traveling many miles.	2	2		2																					
162	3	The settings of cyclist affects the way cyclist perform. If the weatheris too hot then the cyclist might slow down because of the sun beating down on them. If its too cold, the cyclist puts on more clothes which might weigh them down from achieving the speed they need to obtain. The bike has to be stable. Riding on rough roads, braking, speeding, chains in good conditions. The area were the cyclists rides sets the mood. If its a nice scenary the cyclist might be in a wonderful mood as to the scenary being dark and gloomy with nasty weather behind it the cyclist might not be as happy as they could be. These typess of things @MONTH1 help determine how settings can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
163	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The @LOCATION1 desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist. For example the was further route, he takes is not only @LOCATION1, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he @MONTH1 restock on water and become hydrated once again.	2	2		2																					
164	3	Many different things affected on his way to Yosemite National Park, but the environment he was in played the biggest role in his journey. The cyclist was in a dry, desert area where tumble weeds were more common than people. When the cyclist came across the old men and asked them for directions, they led him to a �ghost town� there was no water for the dehydrated cyclist who had been baking in the extremely dry, hot weather. This caused a problem where the cyclist thought that he would die in the desert because of the weather, directions he was given, and lack of water. When the cyclist come across the bait shop he know he was saved. He became rehydrated and declined directions from an old man because these features of the setting are what caused his problems in the first place: old men, dry weather, and water.	2	2		2																					
165	3	"There are a couple things that affect the cyclist in the story. One of the ways he is affected is de hydration. In the story about dehydration it says � The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� A good affect on the cyclist was no one in sight to slow him down on his bike ride. A bad affect on him  was don�t ask direction from a guy from heat strokes on a gorgeous day in June simply because listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been left their porch in decade, caused me to laugh�. One more thing that got in his way was the poisonous snake."" At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously larg snake--It really did look like a diamond back.. Blocked the major of the parement in front of me""."	3	2		3																					
166	3	The cyclist knowing not where he was going got a wrong enformation and he followed it. He was excited to know that he knows where he�s heading too. Along his journey he was aciccted with a lot of things like the sun. The weather condition of their exaction and the big snake he saw. He was affected by sun because he was dehydrating and he almost had no water left for him as it was also becoming so hot alike makes the journey very difficult for and made his mood strange while also following the direction he was disfernded by a big snake he encounter at the case slic desn't while succeed their add was scared that he was going to be attacked unlike anyone to make his way through. The features affects him because he doesn�t know where he was going and he wait a as her cut.� Then he was going to wrong direction and he wasn�t prepared for the journey because the weather condition was� summer time� it was hot and he was riding a bicycle not a car.	3	2		3																					
167	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist with his train of thought. On page @NUM1 it says, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This gives a sence of heat and foreshadows maybe the lack of water he�ll have later on. As he passes a snake, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� So the cyclist is most likely begin to feel dizzy and begins to loose hope. On page @NUM2 he says, ��I could drop from heatstroke�� meaning he�s starting to think of the worse possible things that could happen. Which effects him because he�s beginning to loose hope and  thinks he�s not going to make it. On page @NUM3, he says, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�� By this point the conditions he was having were rough and making him worry. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist throughout the story.	2	3		3																					
168	3	"With little water the setting was not helpful to the cyclist. Joe @PERSON1 said, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� (@PERSON1). After receiving bad directions from a few old men having people passing by in cars or near by stores would probably help the cyclist for asking directions. @PERSON1 said, ""working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength"" (@PERSON1). Having no water to replenish your body will make you weak and unstable. In the middle of no  where that is a problem. @PERSON1 also said, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (@PERSON1). With little water left and a weak body it must have been hard going up and down those @NUM1 also said, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (@PERSON1). I dust in your lungs and heat from the sun as it becomes harder for your body to work."	2	2		2																					
169	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist. The setting takes place in June. It is very hot and the cyclist is getting very dehydrated. You can imagine how hot it got when it said, �wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage.� It also sounded in the story that it felt like two hundred degrees when the sun was beating down	2	1		2																					
170	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist in many diferent ways. For example it was June and he was in the @CAPS1 of California. It was very hot and the dehydrated him. Also he did no know where he was going so he had to rely on other people directions. Also he had to keep dehydrate. That what affected the cycleist. 	1	2		2																					
171	3	The features of the settings in �Do not exceed the posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie were rough and challenging. A biker rides through todi, California which is a rough area to ride. The ride was hot and long that he was so dehidrated that sweat was dried around his neck. The solo cyclist says �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� He had no where to get water or food. It was deserted. He thought if he died no one would find him faster the birds would pick him clean. The essay �rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit by @PERSON1 shows a solo cycilist are very independent.	2	2		2																					
172	3	In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions were from elder men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to decide which way to take when there was a fork in the road. He chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into flat roads that went to rolling hills, snakes blocking his path, and a dehydration state that could�ve killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
173	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist in various different ways. First of all he listened to the old man so he was on the wrong path. So he travels and it�s a hot June day in California deserts. The odds are against him from the start �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I needed a drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June��(Kurmaskie @NUM1) From the ganle you can tell that hes tired and almost out of water. It puts a lot of strain on the cyclist but he manages.	2	2		2																					
174	3	"The setting clearly has a huge effect on the cyclist. The flat roads are easy and smooth to ride on, but as the road changes to short, rolling hills, the biking becomes more difficult. This is supported by the sentence that reads, ""Over are long, crippling hill...� This shows that the hill is a very challenging obstacle. He is also effected by the things that come with the change in terrain. For example, one sentence reads ""...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondbuck-blooked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This stresses how remote the area in which he is biking really is, and shows how it mentally and physically effects his trip.  "	2	2		2																					
175	3	The affect of the setting are two old timers sitting on their front porch out in the desert since carter was in office. It was starting to become daylight and he  had to walk @NUM1 miles to get to the next town. So he gets on a bike and rides to the next town. The speed limit is 55 miles per hour and he  was going 12 miles per hour just like the waterflow. He was riding up and down rolling hills. He finally got to the next town to live.	1	2		2																					
176	3	The setting of the essay efects the cyclist because he got lost when he ask for directions from old people!	1	1		1																					
177	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a lot of ways. in the essay, the author describe how the setting is hot, it is bumpy, it makes him sweat, it makes him tired, he is also, running out of water from his thirst. The road gets, very rocky at one point. The narrator states �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (Kurmaskie @NUM1). There is also a photograph that shows how rough the terrain is. It is barrain with nothing around it.	1	1		1																					
178	3	The feature�s of the setting affect the cyclist because, the cyclist is dehydrated and has to nde on a horrible conditions of a road, snakes and hills. All of these features act like obstacle courses, which makes it hard to do what he�s trying to do which is recieve water. Also, with the cyclist being hot and in need of water he at this point is delinous and most likely doesn�t know whats going on. In the story the authors main feature of the setting is the road. �Rough road ahead.�  This explains the cyclist having to go on a rough road, and doing that dehydrated is very dangerous these are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
179	3	The settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the �@CAPS1 town� he isn�t really warried he is kind of laughing and thinks his funny by saying.� This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time  - say, before the last world war.� Then after he says that it ways he chuckled. When he gets the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water he begins to switch into conservation made and begins to get is scared. He says.� I would comer  water- a test at my inner spirit � This showing that he was scared. After he sees the abanoned Grape juice factory he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind same expensive biking gear. This definatly shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction. When he finally reaches the balt shop he is releved and goes to the bathrom and drinks water. He  also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn�t have a rod. These examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
180	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit, the faetures of the setting effect the cyclist. To keep cool on a hot summer day, is might be neccessary for one to find shade. Just to add to the misfortune of the story. There was no one in eight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" This factor does not help the cyclist at all, infact, all it does is make the cyclist more  exhausted. Another element in the story that effects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tatalizing sips."" With more miles to go,the cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to  add to his misfortune, ""flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the hills are short, they still could have put impact on him because of the ropolalive hills. Many features of the story effected the mood of the story."	2	3		3																					
181	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. It affected him because it was saying @NUM1 miles and then were in the first town, thinking that the cyclist was getting excited and he was kind of all most done he thought he was going at a fast past. When the cyclist got to the first town he said that it looked dead. And then after he kept moving he kind of knew that he wasnt getting anywhere. Then after thinking he noticed that he had listened to some old folks that had never even been off their porch. So after the cyclist had hit the first town he had known right then and there that ho should never listen to old folkes ever again. Because that first town had looked like nobody has been in it for years.	2	2		2																					
182	3	The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.� This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration.	2	1		2																					
183	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the climate could be hot, the road could be bumpy, and the town could be deserted. For example, ""Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This would be hard for a cyclist who is thirsty. And if he is not and with no water he probably could  barely make it up the hills. And with no town for water he would be thirsty.""First ""town"" This place might have been a thriving little spot at one point but anthor warning it fit the outsides of ghost town"" No waters"	2	2		2																					
184	3	Hot, lack of water, lost-all are how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, it was hot. In one sentence he say the sun was beginning to beat down. Also that the water felt around two-hundred degrees. That sweat was all over him. So he had to be really hot. Next, the lack of water affected him and his performence. How was because he was dieing in need of water. He tried everything to get water but made it through with almost no water. Lastly, he was lost. The map that he had was wrong and the trip wasnt what he expected. But in the end he was relifed. So even toward all these negative affects he still managed to come to positive. Basically this story is explaining how if you try your hardest, never give up, and try new things you are most likely to succeed in life and other things you @MONTH1 take part of. So try your best and make way of your life and plans in your life.	2	2		2																					
185	3	The conditions the cyclist has to face are always problems or helpers. Say there is a rocky up-hill part. That will most definuntly slow him down. But if there is a nice smooth downhill part that will speed him up. and take alot of work of pedling off his hands.	1	1		1																					
186	3	The cyclist lost hope because he was in the California desserts in June. The cyclist started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump that pumped out battery-acid tasting water. When he said the sign �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, was very cautious. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist was in the California desert and that made him think he was going to die out there.	2	2		2																					
187	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his trying biking trip through California. In the essay, he describes the weather with �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� While this @MONTH1 not directly characterice the weather, the reader can confin a clear image of the sweltering heat of a desert in the summer. When the author comes across the �ghost town� followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read �Rough Road Ahead,� his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.�"	3	3		3																					
188	3	The setting affects of the cyclist was that the exhaustion was getting to him. What made it worse he was out in the heat sweating which also cause dihidration.	1	1		1																					
189	3	To begin with a feature that affect the cyclist was a lack of water this is shown when the speaker says when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid-thats was one of the biggest factors he had risked. 	3	2		3																					
190	3	As the reader listened and followed the directions of the old-timers he faced many issues and also learned a leason. As he began to ride into the day break of morning he had strong legs and even a smile on his face. As time went on he soon became close out of water and a loss of energy. The @CAPS1 summer day made him sweat and began to think that he birds would pluk at his body as if he would die on his ride to Yosemite. When he finally got to a town he soon refreashed and learned that he would and start to began to follow his own way: of getting to places	2	2		2																					
191	3	The features of the setting in the essay �Do not exceed the posted speed limit� affected the cyclist in a negative way. The more and more he rode, he thought more negatively and had alot of doubt. The cyclist was not very confident, he thought he wouldn�t make it. For example, when the cyclist notices nothing in sight, his tone changes. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon telling myself that if I could make it that far , I�d be fine�. He seemed unsure and a little nervous. As the journey continued, the cyclist loses hope it seems. �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary� He does not see himself finishing this journey the more and more he rides in the middle of nowhere with nothing to be seen except �Rough Road Ahead� signs.  	2	2		2																					
192	3	The features in the setting are very effective to the cyclist. He is in a desert area of California and he has limited water supply. It is very hot and very dry. He barely had an water to drink and he had to go a long way in the hot and humid weather. The deficiency of water could have made him became dehydrated. Another obstacle that he had during this biking trip to Yosemite National Park was the hills that he faced. At the beginning, he was on flat terrain, now he has hills that he has to pedal up that makes it a lot harder for him. One other obstacle that he faced was the snake he ran into. That setting had many obstacles for this guy. If it wasn't for the heat and lack of water, he might have been able to make it a little easier.	1	1		1																					
193	3	"The features of the setting strongly affected the cyclist. The rolling hills were the cyclist�s most challenging problem because they were long and cripppling. Maneuvering down the hill would take a lot of energy and determination from the cyclist. Considering the cyclist was already tired and sweating from riding on rough roads and passing a large snake, riding on rolling hills would be extremely difficult. The features of the setting were not helping the cyclist stay healthy because their difficulty was causing the cyclist to become dehydrated and possibly drop from heatsroke. However, the cyclist kept a possitive attitude and did not give up. His determination saved him as he felt relief when he finally came across the ""Gary and wilbells fish camp.� In conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because they forced him to work extra hard and put forth more effort. But with determination,you can accomplish anything!  "	3	3		3																					
194	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit.� The cyclist mood seems to change as the road and setting does. The narration states, � a large high way sign jumped out at me. I read : Rough road ahead : Do not exceed posted speed limit � sometimes life can feel so cruel (Kurmaskie). Slowly as the terrain gets harder and harder the cyclist feels worse and worse. Every time he believes there is a town he gets happy but his dreams are soon crushed. One can see in the picture the hard cycling terrain that can affect the cyclist making him tired due to lack of water and sense of hopelessness he feels as he loses energy and believes he will die.	2	1		2																					
195	3	Some features of the setting setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said �I wipe the sweat from my eyes.�	1	1		1																					
196	3	The setting had a huge affect on the cyclist. One affect was the lack of water in the area he was in, which was a dessert. Also, the lack of people in the area didn�t help the cyclist out at all. The hills on the road made it more tougher on the cyclist because it drashed what little energy he had left. Also, the sun beating down on him made his body more warm and making it harder for him to focus on what he was trying to do.	1	2		2																					
197	3	"In the setting of � Rough road ahead: do non excee posted speed limit.� The cyclist is greatly affected. In the beginning the authour is enjoying a nice campground outside lodi California when �old-timers� told the cyclist directions and from his piont of view  ""they'd  sounded so sure of themselves when pointing off out land marks and spouting off towns  I would come to along this breezy aunt.� So the cyclist used that information and it wasn�t for   The Better."	1	1		1																					
198	3	How the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when the old guy had told him do you know where to go? An the other guy was like � yes sir! I own a very good map� so how did it change for the man that was riding this bike he saw all of those towns an a sign that said Rough Road ahead. That the man would always stick to the future. What had change was he saw all of those buildings, town, an he was going an going. I think he might stick with the future.	1	1		1																					
199	3	In the story the cyclist faced many problems, one of the biggest problems was the terrian that he had to maneuver them. The terrain was hilly, having to go up a hill on a bike is tireing and wears you out faster than flat land would, and making him use more energy. The heat was also unbearable making it harder for him to focus, the cyclist did everything he could to keep consiese while  manuvering threu the terrain and deserted landscape being a huge desert of rolling mountains he pushed forwad, finding no civilization anywhere to get a refill of water. For example, if the terrain wasn�t as hilled then it would of made it easier for him using less energy and less strain on his legs, the heat of the desert beating down on him probably slowed his progress also. Heat will make you move slower and a cyclist moving down a  barnest road with no shade will make the journey seem longer, and imposible. In the end his will and determination got with threw the landscape, so he could get the water he needed to finish his trip	2	2		2																					
200	3	In this essay, the features of the setting cause the cyclist to become irritaed toward the old men. Ten this essay, old men give the cyclist direction, and instead of using a map, he takes their advice. However their information is out of date, and takes the cyclist through rolling hills and bumpy roads. The cyclist uses all of his energy to get to unknown towns of no importance, and with no water. The cyclist blame the old men for giving him directions that wasted his energy. However he showed realy become himself for taking their advice, and motuising a credited map on real directions.	2	3		3																					
201	3	The setting of where you are riding has alot to do with the cyclist. In my own opinion I think the setting is the most important part.	2	2		2																					
202	3	In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie. the setting greatly affects the cyclist and his mindset. When the scenery is pretty and cheery, he is happy as well. This is shown when the author writes, �denyoved the serenity of an early- summer- evening.� This quote describes the scenery as a serre or peaceful place. His happiness is found in the first part of the quote when he said, �denyoyed� One does not enjoy something unless they are happy or in a cherry mindset. Therefore, the peaceful scery affected the cyclist by making him happy. the same can be said for merry scenery too. This is found when the author says, �At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke�. This quote, describes the scenery as a place that they tumbleweeds. Steryotypically, tumbleweeds are found in dreary and lonely place. This lonely scenery takes it if full on the cyclist. He becomes pessimist and is making of all that could go wrong, not all that could get better. This is found around us every day. The poor and homeless who live with a low standard of living are often said. They have to exist with the affected the cyclist. In conclusion, the seeing does affects the cyclist and his mindset drastically.	3	2		3																					
203	3	The features of the setting affect of the cyclist because the setting changed so drastically. The flat wide open road turned into to �short, rolling hills�. Because he was already running out of water it was making harder for him to have the will power and determination to go up and down these hills. His determination started to fade because he started to see wide open lands with nothing but �tumbleweeds and ridiculously large snakes.� He felt like he was going to dehydrate because the sun was beating down and had no water left. He used pebbles that he had found to put in his mouth to help circulate the saliva he had in his mouth. He wishes that he would choke on one because he feels so useless. 	2	3		3																					
204	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faces many hardships on his way to Yosemite due to the features of the setting. The fact that it was a hot summer�s day contributed to his hardships. With little water, it was easier for him to get dehydrated. In the text, the author writes, �.I could drop from heat stroke, on a gorgeous day in June.� (Kurmaskie, @NUM1). This lets the reader know that the heat of June was very dangerous to the cyclist. There was also nobody around except �Old timers who haven�t left the confines of their perches since water was in offing� (Kurmaskie, @NUM2). The narrator stresses his viewpoint on taking directions from these people since their directions are as poor. It can be inferred that he meant they was obviously out of date when across directions since the ones they gave him were not correct. The cyclist in this story had a rough time getting to his destination due to the setting.	2	3		3																					
205	3	The terrain in �Do not exeed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist had to cope with many difficulties. He was already lacking water from the anduous journey and then the enviroment turned against him. The narration states, �I noticed the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means the cyclist is going to put forth more energy to make it up these hills. Energy he barely has. This  will drain almost all the energy the cyclist has. Another example is, �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that the cyclist is in the middle of nowhere with barely any water and energy, causing even more problems. In conclusion, the setting in, �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie caused many problems for the cyclist.  	2	3		3																					
206	3	In the story �Rough road ahead� the setting affect�s the cyclist. The cyclist is affected by lack of water, the distance he has to travel, and the hilly terrain. �The water bottles contain only a few tantalizing sips. wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt,� this statement shows how he was out of water and was tired and hot. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in the story.	1	1		1																					
207	3	The cyclist has it hard in the conditions lack of water, heat and rough terrain are all things that made his ride harder. First, the lack of water took a tole on the amount of energy he had to keep going. Secont the heat also affected his trip It mad it hard for him to Keep going he thought he would die. And the birds would bick at his dead body. Last the Terrain didn�t help. The trip had many hills and that used alot of energy so I made it harder. In conclusion those are things that worked against th cyclist.	2	2		2																					
208	3	In this I will tell you how the cyclist was being effected. One way is the heat caused him to drink more then her ran out of water. The next was is the misleading old guys that gave him ba directions. Another way was being the long distance and bad terrain slowing him down. The last reason is the snake that slowed him down.	1	2		2																					
209	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. He was riding his bike across a place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food. It was a dangerous journey for him but he made it.	1	1		1																					
210	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. one example is, the condition of his jar	0	0		0																					
211	3	The features of the setting can affect the cyclist because, say that there was nothing. It might make you want to go faster and left out your inner speed demon. That�s all I can really tell you. Because personally I don�t think the setting of where you ride your bike doesn�t even matter. Possibly for a bicyclist it can, but to me I don�t even think so.	1	1		1																					
212	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there are no cars, building, water, or people in sight. It goes from flat road to rolling hills. Even though he had no water he was determined to keep pedeling. �Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit� At this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation I would feel hopeless. There was no sign of hope. He just saw endless rolling hills and that was all. Then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free. So he pedeled up to the building, and that with all the others was abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die. In conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope. If he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case. He is in the middle of nowhere. He finally came to bend and say �Then, as easily as randing a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.�	2	2		2																					
213	3	Theres many features of the setting that affect the cyclest. His dehidration started with the sun beeting down on him and the thirst for water. He was mainly affected when he was out of water and road by an abbanond welchs grape juice factory. �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.� Then when he had almost nothing left he spoted a bait shop.� Somehow I climed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� Then, as easily as rounding a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.� @CAPS1 is when he saw �Gary and @CAPS2 Fish camp � If you want bait far the big ones were your best bet thus realcaving his troubles.	2	2		2																					
214	3	The features of the setting that the author cyclist through definitely effect not only his mood, but his the physical condition. To start, it is mentioned that he is in �the high deserts California in June,� @CAPS1 it is implied that the weather is hot causing the author to sweat as he bikes along. Next there is a change in terrain an he soon approaches �rolling hills� which are more difficult to bike on. Finally the author sees a sign that reads �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit but he still has to manage getting past the rough road. After passing this road he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated before. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the author�s change in mood.  	3	3		3																					
215	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, is the beating sun. The heat dyhydrates and almost kills him. The rocky road is also a factor. It takes up the time and energy he has to preform. Another key ingreedient of the setting was the desert. There was no one to help him and there wasn't a place to get water. In conclusion the setting was a big factor in the story.	1	1		1																					
216	3	The setting affects the biker in many ways. For one, he is riding through the high deserts of California during the month of June. It is naturally hot in the summer, but in the desert, it is twice as hot. This means he will dehydrate quicker, and will need more water. The only water the biker can find is from an old pump, but he couldn�t drink it since it was so hot; nasty tasting. �When I tried a drop it had the flavor of battery acid� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His route was deserted, so nobody could help him. Also, the terrain was bad. The hills caused him to use more of his energy, which he needed to stay alive. �the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke caused me to laugh,� (@NUM1). He also encountered dangerous animals like the diamond black rattles back. The setting also affected him mentally because he was silently yelling at himself since he took directions from the old men. He knew he should have taken the right way, instead of trying a short cut that he now realizes is abandoned and dangerous. The biker is being affected in many ways, both mentally and physically.	3	3		3																					
217	3	  The setting causes major problems for the cyclist in the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist was faced with a desert, traveling in extreme humid temperatures and no water. He encounters poisonous snakes and areas of no buildings or civilization all together. The effect on him was the main conflict of the essay. He had no water during some of the trip and lost all hope. He told himself that it was no use. In the story it says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die��. The extreme measures of the setting caused the cyclist to lose control, putting stones in the mouth to stop thinking of his thirst. Over all, the setting caused the cyclist major problems, physically, and mentally.	3	3		3																					
218	3	The ways that can effects the cyclist by the setting of the place are how the road is shaped or the riding up the hills and the roughness of the rode. There were an sign where it said �rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit.� That sign if he didn�t see it he would have over the speed or didn�t know what the speed he was to go as a cyclist and gotten hurt. The road was made for the cars so the speed limit is hard to	1	1		1																					
219	3	In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affects the cyclist. One setting that affected him was the first setting. I this setting he used up his water and it was hot. this affected the cyclist because he was starting to feel dehydrated and thought he was going to die. The text shoud this when it said �I could drop from heat stroke�, later when the cyclist came to an abandoned juice factory he thought about how thirsty he was. This affected him because usually when you think about thirst you get thirsty er. This also made him dis apointed. The finale setting affected him because he had finally got water and wasn�t thirsty. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
220	3	"On that long bike ride the cyclist was affected by the setting. He was affected of the lack water, the heat and the bad directions, throughout the story the cyclist ran out of water due to bad directions from some men.""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride.� I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men.� Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information. But not the land has changed and the directions were wrong. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help. The cyclist experienced how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal."	2	3		3																					
221	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist very much. For example, the sun was beginning to beat down. Another example, I was hitting my water bottles pretty regularly. The setting were hot and dry. It effected the cyclist very much. It was to the point of dying.	2	1		2																					
222	3	The cyclist in this essay was a very brave man. He had many obsticles in his journey but he still made it. Nature was most definatly not on his side that day. He had to ride his bike up and down hills several times which wears you out very quickly�. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, �After he got threw the hills, he came to a sigh � ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT�.  Now he has to go through bumply roads. �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me�. Now the poor guy had to deal with snakes bigger than him! Thankfully he got by the snake, alive. �Over one long cripping hill, a building came into view�. The man thinks he found someplace to get water, but its an abonded building . �...,by the looks of it � and been a welch�s grape Juice Factory and botting plant.�.	0	0		0																					
223	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is hot, therefore he gets thirsty. When he says �the sun was beating on me� this shows it was hot. Thats one of the reasons why he was tired and dehydrated.	1	2		2																					
224	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist about old timers giving him wrong information about taking this short cut he was going to take. Running out of water and energy and he was doubt himself and giving up on race It say he.	1	1		1																					
225	3	"In the piece, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many  ways. The cyclist felt black humor, despair and then relief due to the features of the setting. The cyclist felt black humor, due to the features. This was because it was very ironic were he was. It was a hot desert and he needed something to drink. He passes a closed juice factory. This spasked his black humor The cyclist felt despair due to the features. This was because as far as he  could see, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind. ""This gave him the feeling there was no chance he could survive. This made him despair. The cyclist felt relief later on due to the features. He eventually got to a bait shop. When he was this live and so he felt relief Of this is, ""Then as easily as  ?  ?  ?   hobbles, thirst and fear were all behind me. In this piece the features were determined how the cyclist felt."	3	2		3																					
226	3	In the essay �Do not exceed posted spedd limit� by @PERSON1 many features of the setting effect the cyclist. First, when he arrived at the first �town� and said, �this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time � say, before the last world war.� This deserted ghost town setting was like a joke and had a small effect on the cyclist because it was the beginning of the day and he still had a good water supply. Though when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps the effect it had wasn�t so mild. He says, �The sight was troubling.� Then when he got on his hands and knees and started working the pump the situation didn�t get much better. All that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid. Lastly, when he arrived at an abandoned welch�s Grape juice factory after several miles. This had a very wearing effect on him since the water supply was low and he had cycled into disappointment after disappointment. This setting in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless. It was only determination that got this cyclist through it.	1	1		1																					
227	3	The story �Do not exceed posted speed limit is about a cyclist who got bad direction to Yosemite National Park and has a depleeding water supply is extreme heat. He is doubtful that he will make is journey because he is dehydrated and dizzy.	2	2		2																					
228	3	The setting in this story is important because if you don�t have a setting then this will not make sence, setting is something everyone can do. It can be anywhere or anything. The setting helps puts the whole story back together. The setting in this story is @LOCATION1 spending time with his family. Setting is a very important part in a morvie/video.	0	0		0																					
229	3	the way I would set my affected cyclist is by him riding throught. Something u would never thing he can set thought then over coming his intention.	0	0		0																					
230	3	The features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead� affect the cyclist. The cyclist started at a camp ground and conversing with some old dogers, and he asks them how to get to Yosemite, and the tell him a shortcut that turns out to be out of date. On the road to Yosemite he sees nothing except abandoned towns. He is really thirsty and there�s no water anywhere. He thought he was going to die. He said, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It was a hot summer day and there was tumbleweeds and snakes by the road and him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it was cooler and if there was a big river flowing by the road. But it was hot and dry in California and desert-like and it made him feel like he was dying because he was in the middle of nowhere therefore the setting affected the cyclist	3	2		3																					
231	3	This cyclist had the conditions of the land to deal with, He didn�t have too much water with him and there wasn�t a good source anywhere near him that he could see. He just had to keep going. He also talked about how the road was rough. This was conflicting on how long it took him to get to the next place with water. More over he was in a desert area. The air was dry and hot, the heat was making him sweat and that was leading him to become dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
232	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting effect the cyclist. They effect the cyclist�s confidence, and hope. I say this because through out the story he sees things that would consern other people like the towns that are suppose to be the best end up �Ghost towns� and the road from flat to hills. Yet he continues on and then says �what I believed was my last burst of energy,� �I was going to die.� The cyclist dosent think he can continue but manages to keep going hoping that the next horizon to see a building or something. Hope saved his life because if he knew he could not continue that he could die.	2	2		2																					
233	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason the features of the setting affect him is because it is hot outside which makes him need more water. An example of this is �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 example of being hot outside is �A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� 	1	1		1																					
234	3	It the short story �Rough Rode Ahead� a cyclist is pushed through an extremely harsh setting  trying to get to Yosemite National Park. In the story the narrator takes a trip to Yosemite National park after getting directions from two older men what the narrator doesn't know is that the road ahead is indeed rough. One narrator states �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated @NUM1). The narrator is really really taking a beating from the travel and this rocks, dry climate is really takens a tale. From reading this story the setting does not do any good for him other than the general store he finds in the end. Like the title states the setting of this story was a �Rough Road Ahead.�	2	2		2																					
235	3	The setting affect the cyclist features because if the cyclist was riding in @LOCATION1 around june the affect @MONTH1 not had been that harsh. But overall the setting out begin in a hot place with limited water was not a good thing. That�s how the cyclist is affected by the setting.	1	1		1																					
236	3	Being a cyclist and in the condition he was in would be even worse in the setting he was in, such as the heat of California, and difficult condition of the path he was on. Him being so hot and tired from the difficult hilly trail would be worse with having the lack of supply of water. The author was very dehydrated and was on the verge of fainting. If it were not so hot, the cyclist would have been in a much better condition.	1	1		1																					
237	3	The cyclist in the article almost died from dehydration and heat stroke and wrote his misadventure in a light hearted, humourous way. I commend him for almost dying and laughing about it and then turning around and blaming it on old people. He is an inspiration for reckless young folk. Oh yeah, and the setting was a desert.	1	1		1																					
238	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� time setting very much affects the cyclist during the story. One of the things that affect him during the story is that it was a very hot, sun scorching day. Also he ran out of water and there was nothing but desert and poisonous snakes around. Another thing is that when he ran out of water there was no snakes warmers  just desert so he started to become very thirsty. In the essay it also said he reached a part where she saw a sign that said � Rough Road Ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limited, so the road conditions starting to get rough him that was another affect. In the end of the essay he reaches a camp where it is all peace and relaxed, and they have cold water there, this affects him because he feels replenished. All these different features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly.	2	2		2																					
239	3	The setting was affecting the character, because as the day got hotter he got thirtier. Also because when he got to the sign about rough roads ahead. He started to get worried and kinda paranoid, so that�s how the setting affected him.	1	1		1																					
240	3	There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town there wasn�t any real water he could drink. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty. Also, it�s the middle of June in California, it�s very hot and size and the is going to wear him out pretty quickly. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says �Over one long, crippling hill�, he�s saying the hills are very hard for him. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story.	2	1		2																					
241	3	The setting of this essay was the California desert in June. If any of the settings features affected the cyclist(which they all did) This had the biggest impact. In the fifth paragraph, the reader leaves that the author was �travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� My prior knowledge tells me that California is generally always a very hot place especially in the desert in June, the hottest month of the year This would have greatly affected the cyclist. He was riding for over fifty miles through the California desert  with a limited supply of water. This put him at a great risk for dehydration, which he tells the reader he reaches in the last time of paragraph ten. This terrain and the extremely hot conditions would make the cyclist very tired and dehydrated, making his journey to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 all the more difficult.	2	2		2																					
242	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Like he was in a desert, no one to give him good information, no towns close by that are still running, it was a hot summer day, no water near by. These affected the cyclist because they made him not sweaty, dry mouth, no energy, and he was having alot of doubt that he was not going to make his journey alive. In the story they cyclist said, ''I picked up some pebble and put them in my mouth. With my luer. I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn�t really matter. I was going to die. ''When he said that he showed alot of doubt. Everytime he got to a town or bulding it was abandoned. He saw an abandoned  building witch was ironically a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. That made him even more thirstier. Thats how the features affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
243	3	The setting in the story greatly affected the cyclist. The main setting was that he was riding his bike in the desert. The desert is really hot so he needed more water than he would have if he were riding in the woods or if there was snow. Also there was hills on his travel that he had to ride his bike up which takes more  energy so again he would have needed more water than if the road was flat, finally, because of the terrain he was riding on the animals he ran into, a snake, could have hurt him. Because the setting of the story was in the desert the cyclist was affected more then he had thought he would be.	2	2		2																					
244	3	In this paragraph I will be explaining some features of the setting that affected the cyclist. One affect was the uneven, bumpy roads he was trying  to cycle on. If it was flat he wouldn�t have to really be more aware, cause with bumpy roads he has to look out for rocks, holes in the road. Another affect are the hills. He had to put out more energy than if the hills were just flat. Those are some reasons that explain the features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
245	3	Some features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey to Yosemite. Starting off, ad men who haven�t seen the changes this world made for about a decade, gave the cyclist a bad start. If the cyclist wouldn�t have gotten the shortcut information, he wouldn�t have been without water in abandoned towns. When the cyclist arrives at some rusty pumps, he decided to check it out and see if there is any water. The water was really not and it tasted like battery acid. The cyclist decided to keep going, even though he was running out of water. When he came to a snake in the rode, he had to get by his �dehydrated state.� I would imagine this would be dangerous if you couldn�t focus well in the road. He then came upon @ORGANIZATION1 that has do and abandoned. He obviously couldn�t get any water there seeing as how bad of condition the building was. When the cyclist had no water, he became dehydrated and unfortunately there were no stops for water on his journey that day to Yosemite.	3	2		3																					
246	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist in many was it was like a crazy maze, the road he was own, and him not really knowing were he was going didn�t help him, or not having enough water. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
247	3	"The cyclist's adventure was very much affected by his setting. It seemed as though the worse his setting became, the worst he personally felt. For example, when he hit the ghost town, he just laughed. Once he got to the fork in the road, he saw less of once exisiting civilization, and he says, �This sight is troubling,�. Once he moves on, he gets more discouraged by the ""Rough Road Ahead"" sign. It seems as though the more dehydrated he gets, the worse things became for him. The climate in the story also becomes @CAPS1 difficult. The land at first was flat and easy to ride, as it got harder to bike on, the cyclist grew @CAPS1 wary and delievious, but knew he had to keep going. The area in which the cyclist was in, had an enormous effect on him emotionally."	2	3		3																					
248	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him in a near death situation. He said �sometimes life can be so cruel.� because he was running out of water, running out of strength, and running out of patience. Also a snake ""it really did look like a diamond back,� could have killed him. He was in the desert and anything could happen. The setting of old men who didnt know anything and the heat could have killed the cyclist. The situation would have been different if it were anywhere else."	3	2		3																					
249	3	"The cyclists problem in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by ""@PERSON1"" is dehydration and the California terrain is the cause. California is full of long deserts that can exceed @NUM1 degrees in sammer, and the cyclist was exerting himself so dehydration was inevitable. In the story the cyclist says �I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June� so the setting is obviously a hazard."	1	1		1																					
250	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very serious way. The features cause him to consider he @MONTH1 die soon, as well as present a variety of challenges to him. The setting takes place in the deserts of California, in early summer. There are no other people in there, no establishments, towns, etc. ; @CAPS1 dangerous feature of the setting in addition to it being in a desert in summer, for example the author is the town learntedat �might have been a thriving little spot at one time-sat, before the last world war�. The cyclist is given almost a hopelessness as well as determination to survive as he runs out of water. For example he says �I was going to lie�slowly gaining elevation while losing hope�. The author makes the trip to a fishing camp and survives. He lerns, because the setting the setting is now lifeles and deserted, to not listen to old people who remember the current setting on if as it was many decades earlier. Because the features of the setting nearly kill the cyclist, the cyclist learns a lesson. 	3	2		3																					
251	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the authour was not and augsosted and as she was ridding her bike there was no place for her to stop and fill up her water bottle.	1	1		1																					
252	3	The rode was deserted there wasn�t a builing, car, or house in sight. He was stuck andhes in the middle of nowhere without any water or food, poisonous snakes and the heat could made him collapse.	1	1		1																					
253	3	"The cyclist on her trips sees a lot of features that would discourage her. She is riding in high desserts of california in June"" (kurmaskie). We all know desserts are steaming hot and dry especially in june. She also encounters hills (kurmaskie) to make matters wose she was travelling on hills in the extreme heat.Though the cyclist goes through many perilous obstacles she makes it to a camp a lives I could seethe horizon, telling myself that I could make it that par, I'd be fine.""(kurmaskie) This shows the author's dedication and that if you don tgive up you will be fine."	2	2		2																					
254	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� the setting is an all- important factor. The author feels the need to describe the path that the cyclist is following and the details each place he stops, such as in �one ramshackle shed�and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule�� and �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite�� In a story such as this setting is of great importance especially since it is so rapidly changing. The story itself would be of much different quality likely for a lower quality, if the author never put emphasis on the areas that the cyclist rode past, this story would not be worth reading if the author were not as skilled a writer as he is.	1	1		1																					
255	3	The setting of the cyclist was harsh, the weather was too intense to be cycling your heart out all day  .	2	2		2																					
256	3	The feature of setting affect the cyclists because if you are a guy and you ride a bike then you might have to where about falling of your bike, or out of water. I you keep at a fast past and don�t have any water then you can get dehydrated. In the essay it tells how he had ran out of water and he thout he was going to die he had gotten dehydrated but lukly he had find some were to get something to drink	1	1		1																					
257	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the mans ride gets pretty rough. Because he took the old mens advice on a shortcut, the once enjoyable ride became a  "	1	1		1																					
258	3	The cyclist in the essay goes through phases that effect him differently according to the setting. At first the cyclist knows where he is and is very familiar with his location. He is excited for his ride and ready to accomplish it. He then shows up at a �ghost town.� He begins to have doubt in his mind about what the old men told him. This place was completely deserted and there was no water for him. He began to feel discouraged when he passed the Grape juice factory and he seriously believed this was the end for him. His hope and enjoyment finally returned to him after he saw the sign for the bait. The bikers feelings and attitude changed as often as the setting did.	2	2		2																					
259	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned �@PERSON1�s Grape Juice� factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets �old timers and the give him a �shortcut� to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their �shortcut.� While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. �It din�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.	2	2		2																					
260	3	The features can affect the cyclist very well or not. I depends on what condition happening. For example, he could fall. Does he have a traveling first aid kit.	0	0		0																					
261	3	Setting is a very important element to the story �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit: by Joe Kurmaskie. Kurmaskie experienced a harsh scenery with high temperatures, low water supply and wild animals. High temperatures without an efficient supply of water can lead to heatstroke, hyperthermia, dehydration and even death. It is very important to always be prepared with enough food and water to sustain yourself through an event such as being last. Dealing with wild life can also be an obstacle. You never know how any animal is going to react to your presence so you must be as cautionary as possible around non-domesticated animals. In conclusion, scenery and setting of a story can make all the difference of how interesting a story can be and how informative, for instance, if Kurmaskie had experienced no weather with plenty of food and water riding through a flat small town in @LOCATION1 the story would not be as interesting.	3	0		2																					
262	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie. The setting effects how fast, hard and long the cyclist needs to pedal. For example, ��Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist was going 12 mph, where the speed limit was 55 mph. The cyclist was beginning to lose hope after reading the sign, but he kept going. Furthermore, not only was the land add pressure to the cyclist. So does the heat from the sun. For instance, the cyclist says, �� and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke��. The heat begins to affect the authors health and his perseverance. The setting affect the mental and physical strain the cyclist has to endure.	2	3		3																					
263	3	This story was a great motivation for older man that can still be healthy and feel like an teenager again. It showed how much effort he put to his goal and how he survive. Forty miles he peddled for forty miles to drink same water the cyclist was and interesting story not ginaupup	1	1		1																					
264	3	It affect cyclest because the condition determines the pace and even how fast they could travel.	1	1		1																					
265	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist was in California, which is an extremely hot place in the desert in June. These features made dehydration a more keen possibility. Another example, is paragraph ten. It explains how the rough road, tumbleweeds, and large snake made it hard for the cyclist to keep his balance without water. Also, the essay describes a building with a poster of a small child drinking a refreshing glass of juice,this made the cyclist think more about water and  become very thirsty. Although thier was some possitive effects of the setting on the cyclist. The pebbles aloud him to keep his mouth moist and not think so much of his thirst. Also, the bait shopped allowed him to opt something to drink, and not die from dehydration.	2	2		2																					
266	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One way it affects the cyclist is because of the weather condition. Being that it is very hot outside the cyclist does not have enough water. Another way it affects the cyclist is because of the condition alongside the road. For example the tumbleweeds and the snakes. Being that its not out most likely the desert is in process of a drought and he gets very dehydrated. I believe these are the reasons because it all makes a lot of sense and affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
267	3	"The features of the setting affect the cy clist in many ways. For example the lack of water was the biggest thing. Without cool water he had nothing to reboost his energy. He would get tired out faster. Even he does find water its hot, like when he says,� brakish water feeling some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This shows how in �the high desert of June,"" the water is all very hot. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes the water still wouldn�t cool down the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot. Also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it. We know the roads rough when he says, �large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. ""This also shows you couldn�t go fast."	3	2		3																					
268	3	The cyclist is dehydrated. He has lack of water for a significant distance before he realizes �that the old men would have been right,had he been riding,� before the last word war.� But any �town� he rode into, was just a run down, deserted, and abandoned piece of desert. He says,�It was a sad, hopeless, laugh, mind you, but at leas I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� @CAPS1 that he was getting more and more dehydrated, but was not quite ready to die. He still had enough energy to keep going, But �hope was fading.� Then all at once after climbing a large hill he gains all hope back. He sees �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp� The rider is safe now, he stumbles into the modern looking bathroom and drinks from the sink. He is now safe, ready to ride, and avoid all men who haven�t moved from their front porches in years.	1	1		1																					
269	3	The harsh setting in �DO Not Exceed Posted Speed limit �by Joe Kurmaskie made the @CAPS1 for the cyclist more difficult due to the hot weather and the inconsistancy of the pavement. The very hot June day was a cause of the cyclist slowing down. �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This proves that the cyclist is very hot due to the summer heat. Another factor of the cyclist slowing down is the inconsistant of the pavement on the road �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� The @CAPS2 proves that the road could be slowing the cyclist also. It seems the cyclist has a lot against him. But if he keeps his head up he can make it to �Yosemite.�	3	2		3																					
270	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the hottnes of the deserts of California because the cyclist was sweating, and drinking his water bottles. Also when the cyclist saw the building, he thought he could rest and maybe get a ride to where he was going but, the building was abandoned years earlier so the cyclist couldn�t stop. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
271	3	Several features of the setting that affected the cyclist were time of year, the desert land, the lack of civilization, the lack of resources � especially water, and the rugged characteristics of the land. The cyclist was traveling during the summer time, which was the hottest time of the year. He was also traveling through the deserts which create an even hotter climate. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,� was a quote from the selection that tells us this. If he had been traveling in the @DATE2, for example, he @MONTH1 have been more comfortable. Throughout his trip, the author does not after come desert civilization. He runs into a deserted factory and miles of land without people. The fact that he is traveling through desert terrain also helps us realize that water is scarce. He has trouble finding a place to get water. This made the trip extra hard and discouraging. �I was going to die� he says. As he travels farther, the land also becomes harder to travel on. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� this characteristic is a setting, like the others, negatively affects the cyclist by making his journey harder.	3	3		3																					
272	3	"The cyclist surrounds did have an affect. In paragraph two the cyclist describes how �I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening the."" To have a wonderful day to begin with was parably assurance even thing would be fine. Confidence was a factory for the beautiful weather as well as he knew a short cut. In paragraph @NUM1 the cyclist mentions how old men looked at his map and pointed out �this breezy jaunt.� The cyclist just thought his life got a little easier. Then in paragraph @NUM2 the cyclist comes upon the ""traditional definition of a ghost town."" This setting was nothing like the old men were talking about. ""Twenty miles up the road, i came to a fork of sorts."" In paragraph @NUM3, this caused confusion and worry. ""This sight was troubling."" ""I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" The cyclist was ""hitting my water bottles pretty regularly."" This setting made the cyclist uncomfortable as well as the ""two hundred degrees."" The cyclist then began puzzled and distraught. ""I notices the terrain changing"" in this quote the cyclist's settings @MONTH1 have caused confusion. But in the end the cyclist suceeded. "	2	3		3																					
273	3	The features of the setting in Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, affect the cyclist because the cyclist is in a desert with no water and trying to find a town there is further than he thinks. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This shows the cyclist did not have much confidens in this desolates area of the jerny.  	1	1		1																					
274	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the road could be damaged or there could be a lot of hills. One example is on pg @NUM1 �with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat�. This explains the conditions of the road could be dangerous. That is how the condition of the road can be affective.	1	1		1																					
275	3	"When the cyclist takes off on the road again he has plenty of water, strongs legs and enjoys the sunny and warm day. But as the day gets more hot and the terrain more desert like and cough, the cyclist begins to lose his confidence, as he keeps riding, his water supply is depleting and he begins to believe that he will die. At one point, talking about the terain he says,"" i toiled on at some point, tumbleweeds crossed any path."" It sounds as if he is struggling very hard to keep going without water and a clue about where he is. When he is almost sure that he is going to die from the queruring that he says,"" i was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�. This shows that by this time his confidecnce was lost because of the insane heat and unberable terrain. He begins to lose  his sanily along with his strength because the setting around him was so terrible."	2	3		3																					
276	3	The features of the settings affect the cyclist in many ways when he starts of, he is bright and happy just as the slenecy is nice and calming. There is a pace that makes him feel like nothing wrong. �I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� After about @NUM1 miles on the cold, his life was getting low, and he came to his second abundant place. He then felt a little disturbed and worried. He needed to find a place with water. �This site was trebling.�  There he fins water plant not his hopes rise a bit, until he finds the water isn�t good. �A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brickish water feeling some which is in the neighborhood of two hundred trees�. So he moves on and finally he re aches life! He is so relieved he can�t believe his luck.� Then as easily as rounding a body my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me �The setting affects the mood in a very big way, the cyclist feels as the setting looks.	3	2		3																					
277	3	The features of the setting greatly effect he cyclist one way it effects him is because it is so hot and he doesn�t here any water left. Also because their are so many almost buildingc and ghost towns this gives him cables haze that he will be able get the water.	1	1		1																					
278	3	Almost all of the cyclist�s surroundings are old and barren. Hot @CAPS1 like weather. The road is hard to ride on. �Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills.� So his ride was a very rough and tiresome one.	1	1		1																					
279	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by how much confidence in where he�s going and how he�s gona get there. Having no water	1	1		1																					
280	3	If the sun had not been so  blaring all the road so trecharous. Also the �devation� often bothers the author because he had to get over the dry and dehydrtion.	1	1		1																					
281	3	When cycling or doing any outdoor sport, the setting matters greatly. If its cold you need a jacket. Hot you need water. Depending on how secure it could be life or death. It could be realy hilly and you might get tired, and if you have no water you could die. Also it depends if its in a city burbed, small town, desert, highway all these factors play a huge roll in cycling	3	2		3																					
282	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in @CAPS1 ways. The cyclist was in California in June weather. If it wasn�t so hot, he wouldn�t have needed water as badly. He wouldn�t have been sweating as much. Also, there weren�t any buildings or cars around, so there wasn�t anyone to help him. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.� @CAPS1 features of the setting could affect the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
283	3	 In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� written by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is that he is cycling �through the high deserts of California in June�(Kurmaskie). This affect would mean that the author would be dehydrated faster. The cyclist, author, is dehydrated before he can make it to the next town because he �gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in [his] mouth�(Kurmaskie).	1	1		1																					
284	3	"In the essay Do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the surrounding setting affected the cyclist. The setting was somewhere outside Lodi, California in early summer. The cyclist took advice from some old men that led him to difficult places to get out of. As the sun made things better and his water started to deplete getting to Yosemite was much harder. The cyclist was traveling through high deserts of California in June. When the terrain started to change from flat road to rolling hills the cyclist pushed himself even harder to get to his destination. The sun and hot air dehydrated him faster. After traveling over, ""along, crippling hill,�  the cyclist had to stop and even tried sucking on apebble in an effort to take his mind off thirst. When he found a habited store he was exhausted and relieved. Then features of the setting had a big effect on the cyclist. The weather dehydrated him while the terrain exhausted him.   "	3	2		3																					
285	3	The settings in the essay affected the cyclist mentally and physically The fact that he was riding through the desert in June affected how long his water supply lasted. If he had been riding in the @DATE1 then his water supply would�ve lasted longer and he would�ve had more energy. Since the town the old men had told the cyclist about was abandoned that also affected the cyclist because he had to keep on going even though he was getting weaker. What affected the cyclist most, I think was when he arrived at the bait store. If that had been abandoned like everything else, the cyclist would�ve died. Luckily though it wasn�t and he was able to drink water.The factory affected him mentally because the picture of the boy was haunting him in a way due to the fact he was drinking juice something the cyclist could�nt do. All in all, I think the conditions that the cyclist was in affected him. Since I�ve fainted from dehydration before I know how it feels to be without water. First you get a head ache; then your mouth dries up and desperation gets in and finally you get dizzy. 	3	3		3																					
286	3	"The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� @CAPS1 the cyclist's physical and mental state. There are negative and positive effects for each state. The physical effects of the cyclist because of the settings all apparent throughout the story. For example, the cyclist reaches @PERSON2 and @PERSON1�s Fish Camp, he is able to hydrate once again. The positive effect makes the cyclist healthy and safe once again. The setting mentally, @CAPS1 the cyclist very substantitially. This can be seen when the cyclist in the comfortable camp around in @LOCATION1. He feels happy in this area. This positive effect prepares the cyclist to go on the trip to Yosemite. Also, when the cyclist reaches the �Ramshackle @CAPS2, several rusty pumps, and a corral, �he feels troubled. He is negatively affected mentally by the little amount of available water. In addition, the cyclist felt ""sad"" and ""hopeless� when cycling in the Dry, arid terrain. The cyclist is in the worst mental state in this place. Finally, the cyclist felt relieved upon seeing the fish camp. He describes the feeling by saying that his trouble are now �behind� him. Settings positive effect in this instance changes mental state from negative to positive. Setting was the main factor in deciding upon the cyclist�s physical and mental state. Setting @CAPS1 the cyclist�s physical and mental state in positive and mental states almost equally in the story."	3	3		3																					
287	3	"He setting made the cyclist feel lonely. The cyclist lost hope quickly because she was never saw any people or water on the way. The cyclist said they saw a �ghost town�. Before he got to the fish camp the cyclist saw no one and was becoming dehydrated. This caused him to lose hope and at some points he thought he was going to die. For example, he says, ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It is clear that the setting affected the cyclist in a very negative way."	2	2		2																					
288	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was in a forest. This was a bumpy trip with a lot of troubles along the way. This was along trip. But he made it tough with a story to tell in the end.	1	1		1																					
289	3	The setting of the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� effects the cyclists physical and emotional attitude. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist, �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on [his] face.� It was not too hot yet in the morning. So, the cyclist was happy and strong. He was confident he could conquer anything. As the day grew on �the sun was beginning to beat down� He was beginning to drink lots of water but he was still confident and strong. �I came to a ramshackle shed [and] several rusty pumps the sight was troubling. �The cyclist was travelling in the hot deserts of California. He was becoming tired and thirsty. He had to save as much water as possible. What started as a confident ride into the desert became a survival ride. Once the cyclist findswater he is relieved. He feels more confident and can ride to his destination. The weather and setting can affect us emotionally and physically just like in the essay, the cyclist became tired both physically and emotionally as the hot, sunny day went on.	2	3		3																					
290	3	As the cyclist begins his journey, he is confident & exited to have been offered new directions from some �old wise men� which promise a shortcut. This water supply is mediocre & attitude willed against the flat and hilly terrain, untill he realizes the directions are way off  target. The cyclist was making his way to Yosemite when he came to the first �town� but it wasn't a town but more of a ghost dwelling. As he continued hoping the shortcut offered by the old �codgens� would actually materialize, he realized he was utterly alone in the hot desert wt a depleting water supply & dwindling spirit. He was disturbed that he had chosen to follow the advice from the older men and through his his pain & dispair, encouraged himself by deciding he would never listen to their type again. The cyclist felt skrewed over, yet through his will & determination, by rationing water & mentally choosing to cycle for each hill one at a time, he endured his physicall, emotional & mental trials and lived to learn the valuable lesson of never consulting old � codgers� on mapping issues, because their information would most likely be out datted.	3	3		3																					
291	3	The whys  the  setting  affected  the  cyclist  is  that  the  hotter  it  was  the  more  water  that  he  drank.  Also the further he  travled  the  more  tired  he  got  which caused him to get hotter  and  which  caused  him  to  drink  more  of his water.	1	1		1																					
292	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly in his determined ride. At first he seemed at case talking about the cool pines and rushing rivers he was going to encounter once getting to Yosemite. After a strenuous ride he started to get nervous and wonder if he was even going to survive. He was running out of water and he thought be a diamondback. Once he reached the rolling hills he saw a posted speed limit sign saying not to exceed the speed limit of 55 m.p.h. He was doing a ''water depleting 12 m.p.h. wonder how he was going to survive. At the end of the rolling hills he came to an old Welch�s grape factory wondering his life was so cruel. After that he was determined to survive and make it to his destination. He picked out spoke on horizon and rode to them makes his way across the desert. The finally made it to �Only and wilbers fish camp where he know he was safe and would survive.	2	3		3																					
293	3	The hot, dry, and baron setting affect the cyclist greatly. Baron is a hot, dry and abanded place. The cyclist is trying to ride his bike to Yosemite national park. He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake.��Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades,�(Kurmaskie). The hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated.	2	2		2																					
294	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. One way was because of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. With the cyclist having limited amount of water effected him to. The cyclist listened to the old men so therefour he traveled a good distance. So that made matters bad. With having lack of water with such distance to go the cyclist stuck pebbles in his mouth hoping to forget about his thirst. The cyclist thought of him dying and the birds picking him clean, because he thought he would die because dehydration. The conditions of the road made it harder, First he started with nothing but straight roads then ended up going up and down hill. In conclusion, the cyclist hit many obstacles that made his trip harder then what he thought.	2	2		2																					
295	3	The features of setting affects the cyclist because the setting then you won�t had, lots on hills. Also there was no water. For example, in the story He says in was were hilly area. Also he says that there are no buliding he is all by him self which @MONTH1 make him scared. So the setting affects the cyclist by being a very hot dry cimate with no water and no builiding; and no peole to ask for direcions would make him scared and lost and fearful of what is going to happen to him.	1	1		1																					
296	3	"During the cyclist journey he was faced with many ?? ??. Mostly the driver ?? and out of water. In the essay it says how he arrived at the first town and was in search for water. It said ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war."" This affected the cyclist because he was running out water. Another feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heatstrokes, and not a single car or building the whole way. "	1	1		1																					
297	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because of the bad conditions of the road and the not sun and the desserts and the low amount of energy supply he had left the reasons why  	1	1		1																					
298	3	As if along bike ride through the city isn�t grueling enough, the author of this story had it much worse. First the climate was a recipe for a disaster. �High deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 is clearly a debilitating factor as is direct sunlight and humidity. If the cyclist did not have the proper gean he could be hurt by all three of these factors. Secondly, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS2 his endurance is being tested because it is going for tolerance energy and will power to climb each individual hill. Most importantly, with his lack of water in his bottles, all of these characteristics were harmful. Within a desert, water is to be found nowhere. In hot weather, the water bottles will turn warm and in sunlight, water could even evaporate. To me, it seems like the setting and the weather were the perfect combination for doing much more harm than good.	3	2		3																					
299	3	The features that affect the cyclist is the lack of water he slows. Another is the directions from the old men that probably aren�t up to date nowadays.	1	1		1																					
300	3	The setting explains an early summer evening with some eccentric men. The mood that he would be in would probably be lively. �Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice�� (Kurmaskie) says that if you were very lively, I would take that as a way of being drunk without being drunk, and doing whatever someone thinks you should do without knowing you are being persuaded to do it.	1	1		1																					
301	3	The setting causes difficult problems for the cyclist and tough hazards. The weather is hot and just going through hot weather is tough enough, but giving through a desert with limited water had to be miserable. The warmth of the desert had an affect on the cyclist and caused him to be fatigue. This delayed him from getting to his destination quicker as well. Not only did he have to through tough weather but hazardous condition too. There were times when �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�. This delayed him and took time to cycle around. As you can see this was a difficult journey for the reader and the affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
302	3	The features surrounding the cyclist effect him greatly. All he has around him are hills, rough terraine, sand + tumble weeds. These features leave him thinking he will die because there is no life around him. Everything is dry + vivid + thats how it makes him feel. The old, rusty water pump shows that it hasn�t been used in ages + the black tar pumped out is no help to his negative thought of life.	3	3		3																					
303	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, �This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I�d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, �conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.� It made him think the situation wasn�t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																					
304	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, �Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven�t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. �This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se � a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
305	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they figured that they were old enough and seen what was going on and been through that situation that they were well experienced and knew more about what was going on so the people should listen to them.	1	1		1																					
306	3	After the cyclist spoke to the �old timers who hadn�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,� his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and �tested like battery acid�. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and �ridiculously large snake� and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn�t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded.	3	3		3																					
307	3	"The features of the setting affets the cyclist in afew ways. For example, the features of the �Rough Road� didnt allow him to arive as fast so was drive @NUM1 on a @NUM2 speed limit. Second the fact that he was drivuing through a desert a large snake made its way on the Road, causing the man to have to ""ease past, trying to keep my balance in my dehidrated state.� @CAPS1 again because he was driving through the desert,hegot so hot & started to get dehydrated of lack of water. Lastly the features that there werent any buildings far miles so he was left lost and didnt have anywhere to stop & ask for directions. These few features defenitly affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
308	3	There were many features of the setting that affect he cyclist to make his difficut journey to Yosemite. First, it was the old timers at the reservoir campground. They might have been old, but not very wise. For example, �I followed their advice and launched out at first line, nd along a �short cut� that was toslice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.� This is describing how the cyclist takes the short cut from the old timers which almost gets him killed @CAPS1, the sun had a warming affect on the cyclist causing him to dehydrate. For example, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularlyand I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This is showing you an image of just how hot the climate he is in. Finally, a lack of water can cause major problems, such as heatstroke or dehydration, yoth which can lead to death. For example �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June�� This is stating without enough water to keep him cool he felt as if he were going to die.  	2	3		3																					
309	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting often affects the character. One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me�. This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was confused. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels @NUM1 degrees. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� That quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. ""@CAPS1 road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made the biker have to work harder, and use more energy. These conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination."	3	2		3																					
310	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,� affected the cyclist greatly. For starters it says he was �traveling through the high desserts� which is never a safe thing. He had been drinking he water regularly but the temperature was rising. He was, �trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state.� From lack of water because the terrain had altered his water into �A far like substance� The setting of the story was cruel to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
311	3	The conditions and features affect everything about the cyclist. The conditions were that, he had to save as much water as possible and keep himself hydrated at the same time so that he wouldn�t dehydrate himself.The features of the desert like land were fierce. It was dry and bumpy, not to mention that there were creatures such as snakes on the prowl out there. You can never predict what they�ll do.	2	1		2																					
312	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when he arrived to the first town the water had tasted like battery acid which made the rider concerve water another is with the harsh conditions such as the temperature. The ride would listen to the old people to try to get to the place he was going faster.	1	1		1																					
313	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. One feature would be the dryness of the land. He was pedaling for such a long time that he became dehydrated, yet there was not a drop of water for he did not know how long and he didn�t think he could make it that far. Another feature of the setting was the heat. He felt like he could not go on because the heat from the sun made him want to have a heat stroke. Clearly, the features of the setting did greatly impact the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
314	3	During the cyclist�s trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the �shortcut� was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, � there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn�t anybody nearby to help him and there wasn�t any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie�s physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, � the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke� This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. 	3	2		3																					
315	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie�s, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. First of all, the cyclist is dehydrated from the heat and lack of water. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""This sentence from the text stores he is dehydrated, because of this it creates an obstacle he must face. Also, another bad affect from the features of the setting the cyclist is facing is, the rough road ahead he had to face. �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXcEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� If I were the cyclist gazing at the sign I would die just knowing there was trouble up ahead. Luckily the cyclist made his way through and managed his obstacles well."	2	1		2																					
316	3	There are many features in the setting that will affect the cyclists. One feature is the climate. When you are cycling and it is really hot you can dehydrate very fast. If it is really cold it is harder to breath and catch your breath. Another feature in the setting that can affect a cyclist is the terrain. If there are too many hills that are really steep than you will get very tired quickly and when it is rocky you have a posablity to fall off the bike and hurt yourself. Last feature in the setting that will affect a cyclist is how isolated the road is. If a cyclist runs out of water and there are no places to stop on the road, this could be almost deadly to a cyclist. Also if the road is so isolated and you get hurt who would find you. This is another deadly situation. These are the main features in the setting that can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
317	3	The features at the setting affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. The setting had a hot sun, no trees, and no water. The cyclist was also feeling lesy. In the story he said �I and the growing ??? :??? That I could drop from heat stroke.�	1	2		2																					
318	3	The setting was hot and dry, which affected the cyclist greatly. She didn�t have enough space to carry a lot of water and rod to make portrons to drink. Also listening to old guys who didn�t know much didn�t help either and sent her on a much harder path to travel	0	0		0																					
319	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. The first was the cool forested road that he set out on. Since the rote not easy, he felt confident and started end in the wrong direction. Another factor was when he rode into the desert. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated and whats little water he could find tasted like battery acid. These factors affected the cyclist by giving him false hope and nearly lead him to his death.	1	1		1																					
320	3	The way the setting of the story help the guy out alot. He was riding and it was hot but with �cool pines and risum river� it was worth the ride. It keep him cool so he could get his weter in the nex town. That is why I think that the pin and river were a big help.	1	1		1																					
321	3	Whether the lack of water, the hills, the tumble weeds � all are things that affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water. The hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills. Finally is the tumbleweeds. The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look. When he sees tumble weeds he try�s to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn�t want to crash. The dehydration / lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive. When you are lack of water and energy it makes your goal more hard to complete.  	2	2		2																					
322	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist by gradually wearing him out and pushing his limits of hope and survival skills. At first, the cyclist enters a deserted town but he remains calm and amused by this in the sentence, �I chuckled, check my water supply, and moved @NUM1). Soon after, the cyclist is troubled by a �ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM2). He is agitated by this, makes a significant dent in his water supply, and unfortunately continues. At the point where he is still isolated and lost beyond repair, the cyclist tries to stay hopeful but soon breaksdown. He reflects, �Telling myself that of I could make it that far, I�d be @NUM3). The features of the setting become more and more disappointed at each leg of the journey for the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
323	3	In the beginning of the cyclists journey, he is very happy and carefree. The cyclist comes to the first deserted town the setting isn�t described because the cyclist is not worried yet. After leaving the first town the cyclist barely noticed the heat because, �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.� The cyclist still has high spirits. The cyclist begins to get thirsty when he comes upon a water pump. He attempts to get water but the pump isn�t in working condition. Until this point in the story to road has been mostly flat and straight. Then the cyclist notices that the road has some hills in it. At this point the cyclist has no water and is very dehydrated. After one hill the cyclist sees a building. The building is an abandoned grape juice factory, which is ironic considering the state the cyclist is in. The cyclist sucks on rocks as a last resort and gives up hope of living , when he comes upon a fish camp. He gets water from the bathroom and all is well. The setting in this story affects the cyclist because as the setting changes, so do the cyclist moods and feelings about survival and the danger he is in.	3	3		3																					
324	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When in the essay it states, �The sun was beginning to beat down� This shows that this affects how he feels when he is cycling through the road and this can affect his ability to keep cycling while the sun ??? him hard. Also when he states �I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,� this shows he was also dehydrated once goin, very slow because of the ammount of heat and lack of water that affected his ability to keep cycling in the area.	2	2		2																					
325	3	I believe the cyclist is a alone, and I think the old man should have shot him. I believe a bike ride that long is a little retarded. I feel that no matter how great or horrible the shape your in you should even go on a realling long rider on a bicycle.	1	1		1																					
326	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.	1	1		1																					
327	3	The setting it the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� in three ways. One way is that it is very baren so there is no shade to stop the sun that is beating down the the cyclist body which adds to his dehydration and lack of to focus. Another way the setting affects the cyclist is the terrain the rolling hills, and desert he bikes through the hills make him work harder using up more energy and exsusaing his ater supply the desert also with it enemies heat make his not trust himself thinks there mirages he sees. The last way it affects him is the ghost towns when he sees them he get a hope of relief that he might get water and out the heat but when he passes in he finds nothing and leaves him chrested and think of death.	3	2		3																					
328	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because, it is hot, and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle, hot and dry with bad directions, and in a desert is bad. It was a long distance ride, in the burning hot sun, with little water, and he thought he was going to die because there was nothing insight. 	1	1		1																					
329	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more ways than one. For example in the short story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist had to endure going over big dirk hills while being dehydrated and tired from biking miles and miles to get to a destination. The setting can sometimes even cause you to lose hope and give up. The cyclist in the short story; started to lose hope until he found a store that sold fishing bait. The setting controls how long it takes you to getts your destination and how you get there. For example, if you come across a dirt road and theres a big boulder in the way, you have to find another way to get there. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways."	2	2		2																					
330	3	The setting effects the cyclist because he is in the California desert in June without water. He is also cycling up and down curry, hilly back roads. The cyclist eventually starts to lose water and his determination is tested as he struggles to get to the next town. He says �wide rings of dried sweet circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some old gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades. Caused me to lough.� The author is showing how the circumstances he is in are taking a toll on him. He also states a road sign �Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This is ironic because he is already exhausted and now he is about to encounter a treachorous stretch of road. I have never cycled for long periods of time and can hardly imagine being pushed to such a state of exhaustion. I can relate it to a time I was played @NUM1 soccer games during the summer heat. It was painful and everytime I received the ball it took all I had to tack it.	3	3		3																					
331	3	In the story the features of the setting effect him because he was running out of water. He also had to manuver around a snake. It made him tired and dehydratied. His muscles got sore from the rough terrain. He got dehydratied from the sun.	1	1		1																					
332	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways because it�s almost like the background and theme of the cyclist The features used in this story are mostly about the background in which he is going and the sites of where he is. He�s showing the reader of how much he needs somewhere to go and also now much he�s indespair at the time. When he says �It was sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� In this quote he is saying that he @MONTH1 be tired and physically not be in his best shape but atleast he knows he�s not in a good shape and he knows he�s in trouble, but he can still laugh it off and aware but he keeps trying anyways. This text in my opinion is showing many different ideas such as hope, awareness, and ability and courage to realize you need help but go on anyways to prove to yourself you can finish what you wanted and planned to do.	2	3		3																					
333	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is a dessert. The dessert is very hot. I know this because in the story, he states that it feels around @NUM1 degrees. He struggled for water but couldn�t find any that was cool. He found a water pump that had ""a tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This means it was hot and couldn�t find water."	2	2		2																					
334	3	Many hazards and rigorous features affect the cyclist. He starts off his journey with the advice of a short cut from old men. The cyclist is very excited about the thought of a short cut and is drinking his water effectliy. Soon he begins to run lost and the sun begins to beat down on him. He take pressure in thinking about the cool stress of @CAPS1 and is then not bothered by the sun even the imaginary setting of fictious stream had an effect on the cyclist. Soon the sun starts to beat on him even more. The cyclist starts to run out of water and he makes sure the vivid he comes across is not a mirage. When he come over the bend he cave to his troubles road and thirst	1	2		2																					
335	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist persevered through the rough terrain which caused him to become weak. For example, the author states �looked the majority of the pavement in front of me and ceased past tilling to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� This shows the author is dehydrated because it is so hot and he kept going even with a physical obstacle. Another thing that affected the author was that he felt like giving up because the terrain was too harsh. For instance in the text, �it didn�t really matter I was going to die and the birds will pick me cleary waveng only some experience outdoor gears.� This shows that the author still had to go even when time get tough. The text shows how exhausted he is by the winds eating at him when he dies. He would dehydrate to the humidity of the desert and heat. In other words, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.	3	2		3																					
336	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist because if you are going down hil and then hit a rough road you not going to do so good. Like for example he had been going on flat land then it changed to hills lastly into rough road. These conditions could seriously hurt someone.	1	1		1																					
337	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a couple different ways. When the cyclist found the gohst town since no one was there he could not ask someone for better directions or get some food or water. The short rolling hills make it harder to pedal because it is hard to pedal uphill. At the end of the story he found a bait shop where he got water and better direction's.	1	2		2																					
338	3	The features of the setting affects the setting by all the big hills, and all the roughness of the roads. As the essay says ''flatroad was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I crested the first few of these a large highway sigh jumped out at me,� prety much what it is saying is the flat road soon turned into rolling hills. If I was the cyclist riding up the hills my legs would get very tired and sore after a while one example, is when my friend ,@PERSON1, and I went  bike riding, we went to @CAPS1 @CAPS2, in fechmisburg, and we had to ride up a big hill, so after a few pedals our legs started hurting, so we decided to just walk go the hill.	1	1		1																					
339	3	There are many ways in which the setting of �Rough Road ahead� affects the cyclist. First of all, he is bicycling through the desert. This poses a problem because it is very dry and hot. At one point in the story, the author writes that he was �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� It is obvious here that lack of water is affecting his in a big way. He almost collapsed because he is so thirsty. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is that he is in a very remote area. He says that �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Since there was rolling now, the cyclist had to keep cycling and drinking his water until he could find a place to stop. Lastly, the �rough road� affected the cyclist. The road made traveling even harder to do and caused the cyclist to have a very rough time. If I had to bicycle for a long period of time, I would much rather have a smooth road so I could renew my energy. The heat, remotness of the area, and the rough road all affected the cyclist on his journey. 	2	1		2																					
340	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly in the story. The list desert climate tales damage onto the cyclist by quickly depleting his water supply. He also began to get worried when every town the old men told about turned out to be a ghost town. This crawled doubt in the cyclist mind that he might not survive the �shortcut� told off by the old men.  	1	1		1																					
341	3	The features in the setting effects the cyclist because there it different kinds of hills. He has watch out for rocks in the middle of the road. He has to make sure he has a lot of water because it looks like he is in the desert. There is no cars around but he still has to look for any cars in case they came out of nowhere. There is a lot of turns. It is very hot so he has to make sure he does not have a neat scaoke. There is no places where he can stop because there is no shade. There is no stores where he can stop & get water and food at either. That is the setting of the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
342	3	@CAPS1   the  story  the  condition of  problem  often effected the mood of the cyclist . For  example when the sign said ,” Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.” @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated . The dry and hot climate began to become problem for the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
343	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he could have tried  if he drunk the battery taste water. or if he didn�t get enough clean water on time. Driving a bike on in a long distance, with no water or any other supples is very energy consuming. So you have to plan trips like that very wisly.  	1	1		1																					
344	3	In the story, the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The cyclist, pedaling through California, is obviously very hot in the �beautiful @DATE1.� He also runs out of water, which nearly dooms him. But that�s not the worst of it. The hills make him run out of water and energy even quicker. There are also no places to stop for water. The cyclist is lucky he survived the rugged terrain of California.	2	2		2																					
345	3	The features of the setting afect the cyclist in many ways. If he wasn�t in �High deserts of California in June� he probaly wouldn�t be dehydrated if he was in @DATE1 it wouldn�t be so hot out. Also if there weren�t �short rolling hills� he would have had more energy. As you can see setting affects the cyclist a lot.	1	1		1																					
346	3	There were many features that affect the cyclist. Lack of water slowed him down. Also the hills and sun were a big problem.	1	1		1																					
347	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit,� the featurs of the setting had a great deal to do with the cyclist. The rodes were bumpy, windy, and many hills. As the effect of that the cyclist had to drink a lot of water. As the cyclist rode into the so called town he found nothing, as he says �I began to pump the old rusted water pump, but nothing came out except nasty blackish water."""	2	2		2																					
348	3	The way the features of the setting effect  the cyclist in what was, going through hot neighborhoods and very road that made her dehydrated and effected her journey including the long cycling which he had to go up.	1	1		1																					
349	3	In the story, the cyclist starts out with a lot of confidence that he can complete the whole ride. But after he left first town he had been riding and needed water, so he stoped at a fork in the road he had just to;to get water from a pump which tastes like battery acid. Then as he progressed further in his trip he came to a sign that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed speed limit�(Joe Kurmaskie pg @NUM1) This part of his trip made it very challenging by making him face rough roads and mountains that he had to cross which sucked the water out of him. Then as  he came over the last mountain, he saw a sign for a gart store. So when he arrived he got some water and got directions for a man who had the best map. So you can see that going over an the mountains, sucks all the water out of the cyclist, so he was so relieved when he got the water at the end.	2	2		2																					
350	3	The features of the setting in the essay entitled �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist in an tagonizing manner. He is dehydrated and exhausted due to the conditions of the environment he was in. the cyclist became dehydrated because of not only a lack of water, but also the scorching heat of the desert. He sweat to much to the point that he lost an enormous amount of bodily fluids. The cyclist also was traveling on unpaved road which required more energy than traveling on one that is paved. Therefore the cyclist became so exausted that he almost died. These are the ways the environment the cyclist was in affected him.	2	2		2																					
351	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in ways of feeling doubtful, confidence, determination and relief. For example he feels doubtful when he has hardly any water and has no clue where he is or where he is going to end up. He first felt confident when the old people on the porch told him how to go and then at the end when he says he will listen to his map next time. He was also was determined because he wanted to get to the next town which he does, that also makes him relived, and wants to get to Yosemite National Park. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
352	3	"The features of the setting in which the cyclist is in change his outlook on the trip. When he first begins his trip, the road is fine, so he becomes confident. When the terrain began to change, he writes, �sometimes life can feel so cruel�, he grows despairing as he faces new terrain with so little water. When he begins to see a building, he becomes hopeful and determined. However, when he realizes its old juice factory, he grows bitter. When he leaves the factory, he feels ??? all hope. The comparison can be shown when he writes, �somehow i climbed away from the abandoned factory of of juice and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope."" @CAPS1 the end, when he is revived with water he almost looks back on the journey comically. The rider knows that his out look drastically changed depending on setting through his journey"	3	3		3																					
353	3	The features of california and the fact that the cyclist was neave Yosemite made the terrain rugged and dangerous to the cyclist california has a very hot climate, and is neove  a desert, so the need for water for the cyclist was much greater man if the had been cyclist in @LOCATION1. In the story, the cyclist had to travel through desert-like conditions with a limited water supply. The cyclist even mentioned in the story how many hours into the ride the land changed to � short, rolling hills,� which would have made it harder to pedal, and making him work harder, in the story, he also mention how the sun was beating down on him, and that would alos serve as a factor thout helped deplete his hydration. Through all of the problem the cyclist faced nowever, he managed to stay determined, when other people faced with his problems might not have been able to make it through. Also, in the story you @MONTH1 notices that in the different stages of his struggle, the authours tone ananger from confidient , to unsure, to desser	3	3		3																					
354	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It made him tired thirsty and he was near exaustion.	3	2		3																					
355	3	The cyclist in the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� took the advice of older gentlemen who offered him a shortcut they knew to get to @CAPS1 national park. However, the land had changed long ago after these men were last here. The fist town he came upon was a realistic version of a ghost town. He laughed at how long ago those men must have been here. Long hours on the hot road and with dipleted water, @CAPS2 sank in. He lost almost all hope when he reached an old and destroyed grape juice factory. He had made it to a bait store for water at last. He would never take the advice of anyone but his map again.	2	3		3																					
356	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by letting the author have hope . When he came across a sign which read ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, his hope was faint because he was doing a water-depleting @NUM1 per hour. Because of the rate of the water, he felt life was cruel sometimes and he thought that he was at the point of losing water. Also when he came across the tumbleweeds and the large snake he tried to avoid them. If he would have been bitten he would have died. Finally because of the heat he might have also did from the heatsroke ""wide signs  of   dried""       "	2	2		2																					
357	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�many features of the setting challenge the cyclists.The cyclist accepts information from foreign old people which made his first mistake.After realizing this he,�I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,and i was traveling through the high deserts of California,in June�the lack of water plus the heat in California,in june would have turned to heatstroke for most people.Even further into the journey,even with all those things against him it states,�flat rode was replaced by short,rolling hills,""@CAPS1 not only did he have excessive heat,and no water,but @CAPS1 he was handed troublesome rodes too.Although the cyclist must have been near to complete exhaustion,he continued through.Fighting all adds,and elements,many features in the setting of this story affected the cyclist,but he overcame them honorably."	3	2		3																					
358	3	"The dry desert like setting would affect the cyclist because he could easily become dehydrated from the sun, and loss of water through sweat. The cyclist states, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state� (Rough Road Ahead). The man is badly dehydrated, but in his determination he moves on. The terrain went from being flat, to short rolling hills. The road had been abandoned along with the town he had passed through, hoping to get water. The man goes can to say, � I toiled on, at some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me ""(Rough Road Ahead). The setting is obviosly desert like, so it is dry, hot, and dusty. This would definately have an affect on his body which is sweating, which causes dehydration due to water loss. In conclusion the cyclist was greately affected by the setting."	3	2		3																					
359	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist quite durastrely. First of all, he was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� He was running out of water and the pump he found only produced.� brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. �and� had the flavor of battery acid.� Then he came upon �rolling  hills� and �Rough @CAPS1.� By the end, he was exausted, dehidrated, and in desperate need of water. The turain made the story more meaning full in proving that you souldn�t get directions from old guys. 	2	2		2																					
360	3	"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist encountered several problems. The main conflict of the cyclist in this text is the lack of water. Cycling is a vigorous exercise and can take much strength out of a rider. Water is neccesary to make sure the cyclist stays hydrated. In the text, the old men had the cyclist take a detour through desert areas and hilly terains. Because of the hot weather and rough roads the cyclist became dehydrated faster than normal. For  example, the text says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tentalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatsroke on a gorgeouse day in June."" @CAPS1, by usings vocubulary such as ""tentalizing"" expresses the cyclist need for water. Furthermore, later in the sentence the narrator make a reference to the old men, giving the blame entirely to them for them suggesting the path. Readers can also can conclude that the harsh setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist"	2	2		2																					
361	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his travel a lot harder. The weather was very hot making him very thirsty and due to the towns being abandoned, he could not stock up on water. The terrain that he had to cross had many hills and the road was not in good condition. With the heat, lack of water, ghost towns, and tough terrains, made his journey a very hard achievement to overcome. With all these obstacles in his way, he was able to achieve his goal of getting water.	2	2		2																					
362	3	"The story Rough Road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie was about a man traveling through some pretty difficult settings. The cyclist�s mood was detirmined by the setting as well as his needs and his detirmination to make it. The setting of the story early summer in California. The weather is described as hot as, ""The sun [began] to beat down."" He, ""was traveling through the high deserts of @CAPS1 can June."" Because of the excessive heat, he needed more water, which shortly became the conflict of this story. As things got more difficult his attitude towards the old men�s advice changed from gracious for their help to wishing he had never listened to them. Also as the difficulty increased his detirmination to move on also increased by, ""telling [himself] if [he] could make it that far, [he�d] be fine."" @CAPS2 for the cyclist, the settings affect was negitive.     "	3	2		3																					
363	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. Their are many features that affected the cyclist. For example, �The sun was beginning to beat down.� they were starting to get hot, than tired. Than when he came to all the bumps in the road, It was harder to pedal. He was also drinking his bottle of water hard. So that means he's hot getting tired and lost �I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength� That is telling us he�s working too hard, than he�ll be worn out to ride. Those are reason's why features affected the cyclist. 	2	2		2																					
364	3	First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a �shortcut� that will take him right to his destination. Then the cyclist was faced with rough rolling hills of a highway. Over his long journey the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination.	1	1		1																					
365	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. If the cyclist was riding his bike in @LOCATION1 in he middle of June he wouldn�t of gotten so dehydrated. This biker is riding in the high deserts of California that reach to @NUM1� degrees. In the middle of @DATE2 in @CAPS1.A it bearly reaches @NUM2� degrees. Also the desert is know to have nothing. If he was riding somewhere else every mile there could be a gas station. Although this cyclist is riding in �No @CAPS2�s @CAPS3�. Lastly the roads in the desert are a lot more dangerous, since people never really drive through, no one really comblains regularly about pot holes and stuff. They are more worried about the cities were many people travel, there is no point to change or fill pot holes where no one really travels.	1	1		1																					
366	3	The setting really takes determination away from the cyclist. The were hills that made his ride difficult. It says, �over one long cripping hill, a bulding came into view.� This shows the hills were hard on him because he says they were long and crippling. Another thing in the setting was the building. He was extremely thirsty and becomes he to an abandoned grape juice factory it said, ''by the looks of a had beth a @CAPS1 Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant.� These were two of several examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
367	3	The features of the setting have a major affect on the cyclist. It is a very hot day and he is in a desert in California with a limited water supply. It starts becoming very hot, and his water supply begins to decrease quickly. The old men who he says �have not left their porch since @PERSON1 was in office� gave him very wrong directions to Yosemite and he ended up getting lost out in a hot California desert. He eventually came to a fishing store where he refreshed with alot o f water from the sink, and then was off again on his way to Yosemite.	2	2		2																					
368	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclists in a big way because roads had bottles in then that could have caused him to get really hurt. Also, the water he was drinking was streaming and tasted like battery acid. Then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him. The setting was pretty baron for the cyclist because he also come across a snake. Last, he thought he saw some mirages that tells me that the climate is extreme for the cyclists. That�s how the setting affects the cyclists.	1	2		2																					
369	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for a few reasons. One reason is that it makes it easier to picture how the cyclist feels. Also it makes the cyclist seem a bit insane for doing what he�s doing in weather that he could, �drop from heatstroke.� @CAPS1 reason is that the weather is affecting the cyclist so bad that he�s seeing a mirage of a �building-abandoned years ealier.� The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the conditions seem impossible to make it in.	2	3		3																					
370	3	Throughout the story, the cyclist describes the hot weather and harsh tarrens of the midwest in his quest to find a source of water. He notes several times about the nice @DATE1, which ear him, quickly warms into sweltering heat as he pedals along. He also goes into detail about the change from flat ground to rolling hills on his journey. Behind these aspects make the use frol final much inorder  for the cyclist and gives the reader image as what he is going through.	1	1		1																					
371	3	In the article �Do not exceed the posted speed limit,� the features of the setting took toll on the cyclist in many ways. First off the whole Setting was a dry, dusty not desert that would chair anybody. �The sun was beginning to beat down, but i borely noticed it.� The own affected the cyclist by dehydrating him so much, which bring me to the next point. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and i was traveling through the high deserts of california in June. This caused him to become even more dehydrated, resulting in him thinking he was going to die. Along the way he found an old abandoned juice factory. This affected him by filling him with despair and hopelessness, causing him to push more and more to reach water. In the end the feature of the setting only made him more determined to reach water.	3	3		3																					
372	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, One way was the weather. In the story it said �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (kermaskie @NUM1). Thats quote said he is in a desert and desert are usally warm. It also said in June and June is usally a hot temp month. The weath affected the cyclist because it was hot and he started to become dehydrated and had little water. Another way the setting affected the cyclist was the souroundings. In the story it said. �There was no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind �(kurmaskie). That saying there know one around to help him so if he gets hurt or something. Also theres no where to get some water.	2	1		2																					
373	3	Many of the features of the setting effect the cyclist. The most obvious and direct feature would be that this adventure took place in the �high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 about that passage says blistering heat; high meaning its going to be closer to sun, deserts, where the world is hot, California, which is known to be smoggy, and June, which is the middle of summer. Also, the closet water supply was �somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees,� there was a �long crippling hill� all while the sun was heating down.  All of that would most obviously effect the cyclists by making him tired, which he vividly explains by expressing his fears of losing conscionous.	2	3		3																					
374	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One example is when the cyclist says �I noticed the terrain changing, Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� This effects the cyclist because it makes him work harded when he is dying of thirst. Especially on a hot summer day. It makes his muscles work harder and use his strength more. In the summer time it is extremely hot. When the cyclist is biking it is very hot, he says�� in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� After this quote he is explaining the difficulty of getting flustrated an there�s No cold water. This affects the cyclist to think about water and not bothering to think about where he is at he could be lost. He didn�t have a good map.	2	2		2																					
375	3	As the cyclist goes on his trip, he is met with many dreary places and people. For starters, the old men he knew he shouldn�t have trusted but did any way. This led him through the desert. Even in a car the desert can be a very despairing place. On a bicycle it must be even worse knowing that if you run out of water op one will be there to save you from dehydration. Just the endlessly bleak landscapes also played a roll in the cyclist feelings. Another bad feature is the endless amount of abandonment towns and spoiled water. Every time he thought he was saved he was put down again by that fact. For example he had to pump for minutes only to get bad tasting water. Finally just when his strength was to give out he found the bait place & water and that dramatically and a place to rest too bad there was another old man there, isn�t it?! 	2	3		3																					
376	3	IIn the essay the features of the cycleist affect the setting because the readers wouldnt have thought that he was in that bad of danger if he hadnt of been going through the desert. When the cyclist got to the grape factory he stated that he was almost dehydrated. And then when he got to the bait shop he drank from the faucet.	1	1		1																					
377	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by their were rolling hills that went up and down and it to alot of streanth and also he barely had water because, it was so hot he kept drinking and ran out of water early. In the story it say when he was riding that � He barely noticed that the sun was starting to beat down.� This quote shows it was starting to get hot. Also, in the story he says � I checked my water supply.� @CAPS1 means he�s starting to realize his waters running short. So in all the setting is hot abandoned and theirs no water source, so  the cyclist is being affected by all of this	2	2		2																					
378	3	SETTING WAS A IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE STORY. I WAS A DESSERT IN A DESSERT THERE IS A LACK OF WATER. AND ME WAS IN A BIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS. BECAUSE YOU ARE USING YOUR FEET TO MOVE WHICH TAKES OUT ENERGY, AND USES WATER FROM YOUR BODY.	1	1		1																					
379	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was biking up hills in extreme heat. He also had a short water supplyl while head in the wrong direction.	2	2		2																					
380	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly was incorrect and he got lost. The lack of water led to the possibility to sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst. The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy.These were the affects the setting had to the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
381	3	The feachers of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. When she biked around a bend, �my troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me.�	1	1		1																					
382	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie, A cyclist set out on a bike ride in the heat of summer in California where he will staying he met some old people who gave him a �short cut�. As he forms out most of the places he was told about were abandoned ghost towns without a single drop of drinkable water. If he were in a different setting like by a river or spring he would just stop and drink from that. Or even if he was in a more populated, industriated area he could stop in any building and ask for a drink; But he was in the dry, hot, abadond hills of California without any water. Under these conditions he grew tired, thirsty; dehydrated; and desperate for a drink finally he came apon a bait shop that had water there	2	2		2																					
383	3	Durring the cyclist @CAPS1 he was affected by the setting frequently. When he was cycling it be came very hott to him but at first it wasn�t so bad. �The sun was begining to beat dow, but I barely Noticed it.� This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not affect him. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was travling in. �I had been hitting my water bottles pritty regularly and I was travling through the high dezerts in califonia in June.� This proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out. All of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his @CAPS2. 	2	2		2																					
384	3	I think that the features of the setting really do affect the way someone rides a bike because certain places have certain terrain. Some types are not always good for a bike rider because if it�s bumpy then someone could fall off the bike. Also, if it is dark you @MONTH1 not even be able to see where you are going then you could hurt your-self very seriously. That�s why riding a bike is dangerous. Also, if your in the type of enviroment where every thing is smooth then you @MONTH1 be able to have a nice bike ride.  	1	1		1																					
385	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, �Do not Exceed posted speed Limit.� By changing him physically. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, �It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting."	3	2		3																					
386	3	The conditions gave the cyclist no hope at some points because the heat of the land the of the features of the setting were so harsh he had no hope like when the cyclist says I hope I make It to the horizon because theres nothing else to compare. He can�t say lets ride to the next building or mail box because there are none. The desert features make the cyclist fell that its just him no one can help him he�ll die of dyhydration. Then the features get worse he sees the welchs grape fruit building giving him little hope of survival then he finds out that its deserted and that�s like the final thing he gives up. The cyclist almost unconscious then runs into the fishing store where he has a sip of water. So the features were the main reason the cyclist lost hope.	2	3		3																					
387	3	The features of setting affect the author because it moves him dehydrated. The dessert sun look sweat out of him and he had no water to bring that would replace his electrolites . Also, once the author had got into the hills he had lost a lot of his energy so peddling up his was a lot of work. If I were the author I would also have gotten tired because you need water in your body to survive.	1	2		2																					
388	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist greatly. In the cyclists opinion things began pretty well. He had a positive attitude as it states �with strong legs and a smile on my face.� As the man moves on he comes to a fort of sorts. To him, the sight was troubling. Though troubling, he still had the confidence that he could continue. Next he noticed the changes in the terrain. He explained �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This means that he would have to peddle harder and with greater force in order to get over the hills. The weather was not and the cyclist was running out of water. The possibility of heatstroke came to mind. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind�, as told by the man. His mind entered a state of sad, and hopeless thoughts, but he persevered and cycled on. At this point he was very thirsty and felt his death was near. He said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean� As he kept going he spotted an old guy in sight. He regained hope and moved ahead. The features of this story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. Physically he was tired and worn out. A like this horrible state, mentally he was becoming negative and pessamistic about his travel. The setting's features interfered with the cyclist's physical and mental state.	3	3		3																					
389	3	In this story, �No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, by be Joe Kurmaskie I believe the setting greatly affect the cyclist. I believe this because when it�s long downhill cool roads is fine but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he can�t keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around so the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story. Another example	2	2		2																					
390	3	A cyclist is a bike rider. They can be in groups of diffrent people or they can be a solo cyclist. Some cyclist go for a few miles riding there bikes some can go for more like @NUM1 miles, some go over hills, go trow water they do alot with what they do. They have alot of time on there hards to ride a bike that far.	1	1		1																					
391	3	The setting is hot like desert, no one around, and very dry. Being hot outside affects the cyclist because he is sweaty and needs water. The heat wears him down. Having no one around causes him to not get water which he needs for his journey. These things make him week and makes it harder for him to find a place to get water.	1	1		1																					
392	3	The setting affect the cyclist because it could be a good or bad thing. If a cyclist adjust his own settings thats good but if somebody messe with them that could be bad.	0	0		0																					
393	3	"In this narritive of a cyclist, riding in california, and handed for Yosemite national park, he encounters a lack of water and bad directions from a group of old men on a pourch. The setting plays a big part in his ""challenge"", from the pine trees to the barren hills. In the begining of his trie he passes a ""gbost town"" that has clearly seen better days. This presents him with his first doubt and he continues with caution. Then the pines that, ""had my name written all over them."" This gives him hope and reassurance. Then the rusty pump and ""ramshackle shed."" They took the hope and reasurance away, making him cautrous. The hills that made him work hard to get over, the snake that slowed him down and the whelches juice company that was abundanded all didn't help and made matters worse. Then he got some water at a bathroom and it was all better. It the setting has less the same the whole way he wouldn't have had any hope or he would have hope but it wouldn't fall and rise, making the story interenting.   "	3	3		3																					
394	3	Winding hills limited water and poor directions are the troubles of this cyclist. First he gets very bad directions from a group of old men that have not been outside of their porch in awile, then he gos through the first town and does not fill is water bottles then he gets lost and runs out of water but finds a fishing store where there is water and people that give him a better map.	2	1		2																					
395	3	"No water, and no direction effects the cyclist. Water effect cyclist because he said in the essay �I could drop from heatstroke"" (Kurmaskie). also no direction is another big one. It is important because without direction he is going to rideing for a long time. In conclusion water and no direction was the cyclist problem in the story"	2	1		2																					
396	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thought he packed enough water so he began on his way he drank most of his water less than half way to his destination. He didn�t realize how hot it was until he got down to his last couple of sips of water. He started to become dehydrated he rembered the old men said that the next town was abait eighteen miles away so he kept on going when he reached the town there was nothing to drink just an old run down factory. He took same rocks and sucked on them, he went over a bump had swallowed it. He said to him self next time he would just go by what the map said everything he had gone past on the way had been run down and abandoned. Finaly he reached a bait shop and when inside the bathroom and got some water.	2	2		2																					
397	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist grate deal. For example, it was not and hill goet dehydrated. He went down this rusty-bumpy road, which didnt help his dehygration And another example would be he found a plane was he could set a change and find the best way to get where he was going. That the features on the setting affection the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
398	3	The cyclist goes through many natural settings that affect him. First of all he rides into barren land. The cyclist portrayed this barrenness by saying �it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This was in response to the first �town� he came across. Next he speaks of a large snake that came close to him which is dangerous, but luckily he manuvers out of its way. But the worse setting the cyclist had to deal with was the lack of water. This is a threat to any living creature. But in the end he found some water and the story ended fine.	2	2		2																					
399	3	In the essay �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting relates to how the author is feeling. At first, when the author sees the abandoned first �town� he is not too worried about it and moves on. �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� The author is okay right @CAPS1, and still has enough water. Next he starts to get low on water, and he becomes more panicked; which in return makes the day seem even hotter. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of california in June.� @CAPS1 that the author is low on water the day seems worse afterward he continues on and runs into a rattlesnake, which makes him even mere panicked �and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balanc in my dehydrated state.� @CAPS2, when he got to the bait store and drank from the sink; things didn�t seem so bad anymore and there was no more talk about water nor the heat. As a result the setting was related to the author�s moods.	3	3		3																					
400	3	The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story the setting is a hot dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seems to start have an effect on him about after he reaches the first town. I know this by his statement.�This place might have been a thriving little spot at time �say, before the last war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chucked, checked my water supply and moved on. The the sun was beginning to beat down. The summer heat is thriving how during this @DATE1 and he is drinking lots of water.�So this setting does affect him greatly it causes him to use his water supply and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration. I know how the summer heat can affect you during @DATE1 activity �s. At times it feelslike you are going to die but that building is always around the bend just for the cyclist.  	3	2		3																					
401	3	"In Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the features of the setting are devastating to the cyclists condition. ""@CAPS1 through the high desert of California"" is surely never an easy task to begin with. Without proper hydration, people often suffer heatstrokes or pass out, sometimes even perishing, it is entirely worse for this cyclist because of the effort he is exerting, pedaling over �short, rolling hills.� Even worse, the trail a few very old, eccentric men set run on doesn�t do much in the way of nuping with a depleted water supply. The first town the cyclist comes across easily splits �the traditional definition of a ghost town� and the only other water pump he comes to emits only sewage and incredibly hot brackish water. Therefore, the heat is only made worse by the look of water on the cyclist path. This combination of features in then setting causes a great deal of distress to the cycling, and almost pushing him to death."	3	2		3																					
402	3	There are many ways the setting affected the cyclist in this story like the weather, supply of food and water, wrong estimation for old people and the road. First off the weather was was very dry and it was two hundred degrees, so it made you sweat and hard to breath. The supply of water was harsh not much around at all and when he tryed to get water the pumps would pump out not water. The weather and water supply were two maijor affects on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
403	3	"In the beginning of the story the author is happy, but towards the end grows upset. ""I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face� (@NUM1). This shows how the author is in a good mood and happy to be there. She is on a journey, and no one can touch her. Then the story takes an unexpected turn. �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� (@NUM2). After getting lost in a town that seems distant from any living things the author hears people! She is extremely reliefed to have found anyone of help to her. She gets water and is forever greatful. The setting is horrifying to her because you will feel like you cant even if you live there! She felt alone and that she would die. If the setting was in a city surrounded by buildings the author would still feel some security even without water"	3	3		3																					
404	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The reasons were the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water were cooled down offer he refilled it all the way up. My last reason is because of the rolling hills.	1	1		1																					
405	3	There are features such as blazing heat coming off the sun, �short, rolling hills�, and no water. There was also the fact that the rider thought he was in the middle of nowhere. This has a great effect on the cyclist, both physical and emotional. The heat, lack of water and constant up hill riding can take a lot of energy out of someone and make it extremely hard to ride. Not to mention there isn�t much hope left so that eliminates the whole mind over matter thing. All the features of the setting put together can lead to major trouble.	2	2		2																					
406	3	Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. After about @NUM1 miles, when in need of water supply the cyclist found a rusty pipe which a tarlike substance came out, then a brackish water substance. While cycling, you are in need of clean water. Next, the terrain changed from being flat to very hilly. In need of water,the last thing you need is be to be challeged more. Later on down the food, there were no cars or any buildings in sile. When you are feeling the the worst, you would want someone to he near in case you fall out, but no one was in site on that road. Lostly, seeing the old welch's Grape Juice Factory would affect the cyclist. Seeing that image of a drink factory right infront of you but not business has to make them fell like he/she will never make it. These features of the setting had to affect the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
407	3	The features in the setting dramaticaly affect the cyclist. Everything was fine until he ran out of water and reached the hills. Now if he was in callada he woudn�t of dehydrated. But the hills were sure to play with his mind. The most import setting is the welchs grape juice factory. He would have had all of the grape juice he wanted, but it was abandoned. An ironic twist �as he calls it. And the last one is hte bait shop that sawes his life, where an old man offers him directions.	1	2		2																					
408	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because he was in the middle of no-where with no water or direction. The man was also very thirsty and had no water left in his water bottle, he began to get very thirsty. I found an example to show that he was thirsty. �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel�. By saying he was doing @NUM2 when it should have been @NUM1. was saying he was getting very exhausted and he needed water to get him feeling refreshed once again. Also, the fact that there was no one in sight to give him direction effected him too because he didnt know where the next refudge was. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. � From the mans point of view, he probably thought civilization was many more miles away and he probably could not make it that for. The setting effected him by making him probably begin to stress or panic a lot for the most part.	2	2		2																					
409	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he feels dehydrated and tired because he is riding through the desert and has a lack of water. I often feel this way when jogging for extended periods of time. The men in the story �who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office� also add to the story. Due to their role, the cyclist takes an unmarked shortcut that turns out to be horrible. The Welch�s factory affects the cyclist because it increases his thirst and causes him to once more think about it. The sign showing grape juice looks irrisistable to him and drives him to keep forward in search of anything to drink. The terrain charge also affects the cyclist because it causes him to have to work ever harder to get up hills now rather than just ride flat terrain.	3	3		3																					
410	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 the heat the cyclist experienced, since he was in a desert in June, made him dehydrate faster. The heat made him drink more so he ran out of water more quickly. Then he would try and conserve water by not drinking and this would cause him to dehydrate more because he was losing body fluid in sweat secondly, in paragraph @NUM2 it says, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� These hills affect the cyclist because he would need to use more energy to cycle up the hills. This would cause him to become exhausted more quickly than he would on flat land. If the setting had been different, such as not being in a hilly desert, the cyclist would not have become as dehydrated and tired as he did. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.	3	2		3																					
411	3	The features of the setting directly affects the cyclist. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This affects the cyclist because in June it is very hot and going through a desert makes it worse, so he would continue to drink water until he has no more. He is also using energy which is making him sweat and drink more water. �One ramshackle shed. Several rusty pipes and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule greeted me.� This could also cause a problem because he can�t renew his water source, which means he has to conserve it, and can�t use as much energy. Both of these things factor into the setting, in a desert with no water, affecting the cyclist more than cycling in a cold day.	2	2		2																					
412	3	The cyclist in, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, was affected greatly by the features of the setting. First of all the weather was extremely hot and hot weather just makes you feel exhausted and like you can�t do anything. Also no one is in sight. She is all alone making her feel small and helpless. I know that when there is no one around I get scared. Finally there is no water around. The author is obviously dieing of thirst and with nothing around her she acts even thirstier.	1	2		2																					
413	3	The setting effected the cyclist by the rough roads, the cylist having a hard time pedaling over the roads. The snake, the cyclist got scared of the snake on his ride through the �town.� The fact he was running out of water and the water he found tasted like battery acid. The setting was very rough on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
414	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tiered, scared, thirsty and cause him to worry. The setting was a hot California day in June and the cyclist was riding through the heat and over the hills and difficult terrain. The cyclist describes the land when he says, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� He also says, �Over one long, crippling hill.� As the cyclist gets further and further, he has more doubt. Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, �Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, �Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.� The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence	3	3		3																					
415	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by helping him get water for his thirst. And getting back on the road to go where ever he is trying to go at. But the only thing is that he didn�t never say anything about getting his bait for the fish. Also, cyclist was all so affected because he almost died from thirst and no road.	1	1		1																					
416	3	He race trying to get yosemitre for some rushing river	1	1		1																					
417	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many way. Having desert rahas makes you want to just lay their and not try to go any further, because you don�t know where and end will be. As for grassy, flowery land its more of a sense rout, and makes you want to keep going and see many things. Hills and terrain make it harder to keep going but more of a chalange, and a good workout at the same time, the setting does affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
418	3	When the cyclist first recieves directions to Yosemite Park from the �old timers� he met, he was pretty confident that they knew what they were talking about. To his dismay, these elderly men sent him through life threatening conditions in a deserted area. As the cyclist begins his journey through the hot, June weather, he �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.'' As he continues forward, he notices that there are no buildings, cars, or people of any kind. He passes abandoned towns and creeps into the desert flat land. The flatland however, morphs into crippling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes awaiting. Not only is the terrain suddenly different, but the cyclist is rapidly deteriorating. Tiredness and lack of water make the cyclist think �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.'' It was amazing that through all this, the cyclist was able to reach a small fishing camp where he is quickly replenished. �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp'' saved the cyclist from almost certain death and him to always just use his map.  	3	3		3																					
419	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit.� The feautures of the of the area the cyclists rides through affect him greatly. For example when the narration says, �At some point, humble weeds crossed my path� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The tone of the cyclists from the quote above shows despare creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, �@CAPS1 hill, a building came into view� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist sounds more hopfull than before. That is how the area the cyclist enters affects him.	2	2		2																					
420	3	"In the story the cyclist is affect by many features of the desert. The main feature is the heat. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June."" He�s also running low on water,�The water bottles only contained & few tantalizing sips.� He�s faced by extrem heat and lack of water. He�s tired and has a long way to go. So far, all of the towns have been deserted. Finally he reaches a bait shop and his water and refills his water and promised to stick to the map in the future."	2	2		2																					
421	3	In the essay the setting affects the cyclist is different ways. For example, the couse must have been tough because he was dehydrated and it says that there are rolling hills and rough roads. Another example is there were dangerous animals like snakes that he came across. In conclusion, these are some reasons how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
422	3	The terrain described in this essay add affect to the strugles of the cyclist. For example when the author says �their were no cars nor buildings in sight� that adds to the affect that he is really out in the middle of nowhere. Also it adds a lot of affect when he comes upon an abandond juice factory and he is so thirsty he puts stones in his mouth to gather saliva. Also when he finally finds water an �oldtimer� asks if he knows the best way to go.	2	2		2																					
423	3	In the essay the cyclist is riding in the desert. It is extremely hot out because it�s June and that causes alot of problems for him. He said that since it was so hot he was afaid of getting dihydrated. Also he explains that the roads were getting hilly, which would have caused him to work harder, meaning he was lossing my water.	2	2		2																					
424	3	The features of the setting negatively affect the cyclist. When the cyclist arrived at the first �town�, he could tell there�d be some issue. It was a deserted, run down area. The water was hot. Down the road the setting started to change from flat land to hills. There was a big snake in the road. He was becoming very dehydrated going through hilly areas with little to no water.	2	2		2																					
425	3	I think it explains because they did good job but it was not good either because they did the right thing but they did same thing worng to.	0	0		0																					
426	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead : Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit,�  by Joe Kurmaskie�  the features of the setting affects the cyclist. Dehydration caused by heat could not enough water caused the cyclist to sweat and to feel nautious. �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh. In this quote he is thinking about all the bad and horrible things that could happen to him because he is already in an bad state. In conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.	2	0		1																					
427	3	"The features affect the cyclist in a big way. For one the ""heat beating down on him made him sweaty, hot and tired. The heat had also made him thirst which led him to drink a lot of water in a little amount of time so he ran out of water before the next town. Also the fact he was in the desert there were no trees to give time off shade that he could rest in. There were also no people around to help him or give him water. So in the ride he struggled more than he thought he could."	2	3		3																					
428	3	Some of the things that affect the cyclist was the lack of water. �The water, bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, water is a big importance. To stort men. Your body need water to work right. The @CAPS1 humid, dry weather of California was a affect To. �The high deserts of California in June.� �l could drop from a heatstroke.� The sun is unbearable, expessary without shade and water, @CAPS2 affect on the cyclist up. The have of animals � There was No- one in sight.� It would have been a lot easier for the cyclist if store or people would have been around, @CAPS2 exact is the animals. �A @CAPS3 large   snake crossed my path.� �diamondback- blocked the majoritly of the pavement. It would have been to worry about those things these are all things that affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
429	3	Rolling hills, open terran, hgh deserts-all are features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, Rolling Hills could take energy out of the cyclist when having to travel for miles on end. The open terrain leads to the beating sun which also puts pressure on the cyclist. Lastly, high deserts would have an affect on the cyclist because he has to pedal for mles on end in rough dry terrain putting strain on him overall.	2	2		2																					
430	3	In the case of thr cyclist in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,� the setting has an enormous affecton the biker. Preclaminatly, the weather causes him to feel dehydrated. He says that he �had been nitting my water bottles pretty regularly. �@CAPS1, he tries to get water from the old well, for the demonsrtrating just how much he needed water. The wate in this pump, the owner said, was, �somewhere in the neighbar had of two hundred degrees. If the water has reached such a high temperature, the reader infe that it must be not outside the author implied nthis when he says he is California in June, it is agarsears day, and the sun was beating down. Another aspect of the setting, the lane, dirty, �ghost town� infested land, had a larse affect on the cycle. As he begins to see how hope. He cannot see any signs of madon life; �there was no one is sight, not a building car or structure of any kind. This empty land make the cyclist himself feel empty. Most literally, the fact that the setting was unknown to the cyclist affected his confusion. He didn�t know the best path to his destination and therefore relied on others for aid. Because of this, he ends up lose and acne.	3	3		3																					
431	3	There were many different conditions that effected the cyclist. He did not have the proper ammount of water for the journey witch made it difficult. He states in the story, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1 the terrain and hills made it difficult. He ran into snakes and very deserted country. But his determination led to success and arrived into a town	2	2		2																					
432	3	"In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first �town� that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist �chuckled and moved on�, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached �the fork of sorts� twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber�s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men�s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."	3	3		3																					
433	3	Some features can affect the cyclist. The weather can slow them down like if it was cold or hot outside it can slow the person down. If the person does not	1	1		1																					
434	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the road that he was on. He was on a road that had snakes and that the trees where all on the road. The road was like a snake cause it was waved and it had a hug hill that made you go fast and it was hard to star dark because the hill was stipped and know one would ride that hill by if it was a rash than it would have been easier to ride the hill cause than there will be more people these would be some people that are these that can help you if you get hurt. There is also no lights there or if you ride at night then you can�t see where you are going un less you put a light on you bike or himilet then you can ride easier the hill at night. That light there is the features of the setting that affects the cyclist that is going down a hill that know one is there that can help you if you need the help you can get it.	1	1		1																					
435	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there was a lot of detours and distractions where the cyclist rode. The cyclist had to pay full attention to the road or else the cyclist could have been seriously injured. The features of the setting also affect the cyclist because he has to go down steep hills and windy turns. In conclusion the features of the setting has a huge affect on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
436	3	Setting can affect a cyclsit in many ways. Just as I read in the story, being in a desert dehidrated him. It was hot, the road was bumpy and the dangers of poisnous snakes. The cycclist could have died in many ways such as: heatstroke, falling of his bike, dehidration, and a bite form snake. Say ??? in the mountains of ???.There are many problems that face you there.	1	1		1																					
437	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by causing him to be hit with his water bottle regularly, the high deserts of California affected him. Also, �Not the miles into the next section of the ride, he noticed a terrain change.� For example flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills. Then after over coming that, �A large highway sign jumped out at him saying or reading,� �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit. And that was 55. Last the author says, �Sometimes life can feelso cruel. In conclusion there were many things that affected the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
438	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that they would drink up all of there water because it was hot and they would get ??  thirsty from all of that ???	1	1		1																					
439	3	In the essay intitled �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed the speed limit� the setting changes as so does the mood of @NUM1 essay as well as the mood of the cyclist. For example towards the begining of the essay, at the reserve the essay states, �At a resevoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening.� This shows how towards the begining of the essay the cyclist is happy, just woke up and getting reading to go on a nice bike ride; however this all changes when he gets directions from a cople of �old-timers.� From that point on his trip goes down hill and the essay states, �About forty miles in to the pedal, I arrived at the first �town�, a ghost town,� �The sun was beginning to heat down,� This also shows the the setting of a ghost town and a setting with the sun beating down is effecting the mood of the essay and the mood of the cyclist as well as when he goes another @NUM2 miles to a different ghost town with only a few rusty water pumps containing acid flavored water. At this point cyclist is very worried because its hot and he has no water, while knowing he has another @NUM3 miles to go. @NUM3 miles of rolling hills and hot sun shile seeing a �A Rough Road Ahead� sign and a diamondback snake he is sure he is going to die. However it all changes when a different sign, one for a baitshop. This is how the author, Joe Kurmaskie uses the setting to effect the mood.	3	3		3																					
440	3	The dusty, dry setting has a serious effect on the cycling author. It got so long and hot that, ��@CAPS1 blues tune �summer time� rattled around in�my deteriorating brain.� The author has spent so long cycling through heat, his brains starting to shut down. It�s also because there is very little water left for him. Another problem is that every building/town except the last building is deserted. So without any chance of being refueled and restocked, it�s the author v.s nature. Plus, as the author states, the directions came from old people who, ��haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� The word has greatly changed. Towns have become deserted, buildings rundown but the roads are kept in shape. The towns the old people mentions are now ghost towns, and are no help to the author. 	2	2		2																					
441	3	As the cyclist continues on his ride, changes begin to occur in the surroundings, which ultimately affects the cyclist�s attitude. When first starting out on his journey to Yosemite, the cyclist started out that morning, �with strong legs and a smile on my face�. He had received information from a few of the older locals that would help to cut the amount of time it took to arrive at Yosemite National Park. However, as he was riding, the cyclist realized that perhaps the older men�s travel advice was a little out dated. with barely any water left to hydrate himself, and being surrounded by nothing but more road and desert, the cyclist couldn�t help but laugh. �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. �At this point, the cyclist was mad at himself for not just using the map that he had brought with him instead of listening to the locals. Although the cyclist remained determined to find water, he had begun to lose hope when he suddenly came across a bait store. Here he was able to rehydrate himself, and with his renewed spirit, continued on his journey, this time using his map.	3	3		3																					
442	3	The cyclist was riding on a rough bumby dangerous road. He had to be on the look out for animals that might try and nort or even kill him. Since he had no water he was de hydrating. Also the road was hot very well taken care of it took more energy to get through it.	1	1		1																					
443	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it just looks like he is on the highway as in the desert riding his motorcycle or bike and it does look like hes coming or going on a vacation and because of the way hes riding it it seems hes going real fast as about to fall.	1	1		1																					
444	3	The cyclist is out in the desert there for was tired & also running out of water so hes getting dehydrated. 	1	1		1																					
445	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist by changing his mood. At the strat he had can eidance which died once he got into the barren dessert but picked up when  he round a rest stop. A prime example to how he started leds and a smile on my face �to� and the growing realization that I could dropping heartstroke on a gorgeous day in June becaused listen to some gentelmen who hadn�t been off their perch in decades � to� I had an over welming urse to seek out Gary and wilber kiss them and buy some bait. � The over all mood ox the story is based off how the authour feels.	2	3		3																					
446	3	The features of the setting in this story, �Do not exceed Posted Speed limit,� affect the cyclist in a huge way. The cyclist was biking through California in a desert-like area. It can get very hot there,like the writer describes, �wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.� The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed.  	2	2		2																					
447	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist. �I maneuvered down the hill.� This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would hawe been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy. If there werent anyhills to get in his way.	2	1		2																					
448	3	"The setting in this story was hot and filled with rolling hills. These factors greatly effected the cyclist. The hot weather was bad for the cyclist because he had a limited water supply.The text says, �The sun was beginning to beat down� (@NUM1). Showing the temperature was rising.  The text says, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (@NUM2). The author�s battery was leaking acid so it was harder to make it over the hills. Seems like everything went wrong for this man but he still made it."	1	2		2																					
449	3	"In the start story �Do not exceed speed limit,� time of year and place setting were the main things that affected the cyclist. This story takes place in the deserts of california in June. The fact that the story took place in June (and especially in a California desert) really is what caused the cyclist�s dehydration. Anywhere in this country, June is summer, and summer means that it gets hotter and more humid than usual. This heat cause the dehydration and the ""growing realization that I (the author)"	1	1		1																					
450	3	The settings in the story affected the cyclist throughout the story with winding roads and hills peddling can already be tough, tiring, and challenging, with the rider having little to know way or the roads were ten times harder to deal with. And with no landmarks or places insight its hard to have confidence because theire is nothing to keep going for.	1	2		2																					
451	3	Don�t let anything stop you with your goals. Going to Yosemite National Park. Takes a status that would out home off side. Forty miles into the trys comes to a town. Got to a water station and get nothing because old men say �the water taste like buttery acid. Lead going to hills and azyl towns, @CAPS1 can be rod without anything to drink. People die  from heatatacks because they don�t  sits and take herats for water and food.	1	1		1																					
452	3	Features in the setting of the cyclist does in fact affect him in many ways. The setting in the passage include features like, no one to be seen, no buildings, dirty, bumpsy terrain, hot weather and plenty of vegetation. All these features affect the cyclist in negative ways. For instance, the dry weather affects the human body with dehydration which the cyclist is affected by.	1	1		1																					
453	3	The setting in the story affect the cyclist alot. It is June in the California desert. The sun is heating down on him. Another problem that he faces is that there is a very rough terrain. All of this together makes him drink up his water even faster. The setting is making him feel very disprate when is even worse.	1	1		1																					
454	3	Each person has a really good ability that stands out. Someone can be good looking, smart or confident. Someone @MONTH1 never give up and do what he wishes to do. The cyclist in the story is or man with a strong will. He wants to be alive. He saw too many difficult in his way to get the place he wanted to be. He listened to some old guys and he lost his way. The sun was beginning to beat down. He was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal. He was losing his strength. The weather  was @NUM1�@CAPS1.The  water  tasted  like  acid battery. He  believed  himself  that he can be alive. He got stronger by believing in himself eventhough he was losing strength. Every place that he passed by was a new experienced for life. They were like a game that he came successful. He never give up. He did everything he could do to not losing his mind. He didn�t want lose the battle in his mind.   	2	3		3																					
455	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist more tired and thirsty. The rolling hills where he had to pedal up and down and the desert with no water in sight just dry land. Everything in the setting was increasing the conflict in his story. The old Welch�s Grape Juice Factory,is like drinks are right there but are now gone. If it would have been Yosemite with cool pines and rivers he would�ve felt completely different. No people in sight lacked security and water, also no buildings. The tumble weeds gave you no hope of getting any where and the snakes and vultures just eating you after you died. Everything in the story was the opposite of what he wanted until he got to his last hope the bait shop.	2	1		2																					
456	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting of the story majorly affected the cyclist. The story tells us ��I was travelling through the high deserts of California  in June.� The extreme heat of the summer definitely put a  strain on the cyclist causing him to have to drink lots of water . Unfortonatly the  �towns� were very far apart and many not having good water making dehydration  problem. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.� @CAPS1 of this would have happened had he been cycling at a marathon with people handing him water when requested, or if he had been smart enough to follow a good map.	2	2		2																					
457	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, on page @NUM1, Kurmaskie said � I got down on my hands working the hande of the rusted water pump with all my strength� that shows desperation due to the lack of water.	1	1		1																					
458	3	The features of the setting been amajor affect of this cyclist  in the  story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but think is a lot like and winding. The cyclist also comes across bumps, non-paved roads that make it hard to meneuver through. Then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story.         	2	1		2																					
459	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in the high deserts of California where it is very hot so, you need alot of water. Then he needs more water and finds a water pump but cant use the water because it was �some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" Then the terrain in changes when he says �Flat road was replaced "	1	2		2																					
460	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because I was talking about the exceed posted speed limit. How the speed limit or were it says �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office. They are trying to say is that, you do what they say you are going to be mesem peoples travel will not work, so make the right choice and do the right thing.	1	1		1																					
461	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by that he or she should behave act or talk according to the settings. It means that where ever they are existing and whatever it looks like, they need to fit them self in. They also need to fit the mood according to where they are located. The cyclist is feeling comfortable according to the story and he dosent need any change in setting or location. For conclusion the features of the setting affects the cyclist by that he needs to make improvment and changes according to where he or she is located. 	1	1		1																					
462	3	In the beginning the cyclist was ready to go and happy. By the time he got half way there he was �losing hope�. It was very hot and he was simple alone. By the end, he was relieved because not only did he find water, he found an easier way to get to Yosemite. The first old group of men didn�t help, but the second man did.	1	1		1																					
463	3	"In the story �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the features of the setting affect the cyclist, it say this because the cyclist enables us of what is going around him and he feels about it. It says, �one ramshack shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule greated me. The author goes on to say that it troubled him. Actually that made the author scared that maybe he was all alone in the desert with ghost town. The unplanned that the roads were rusty where the speed limit was 55 mph since he barely had any water he was going 12 mph. This tells me, he�s troubled and confused about the surrounding ways, because it all desert seem light it became the author is slowly loosing hope on the travels further and further. I think it�s the same week people that as soon as trouble comes; or looks like it�s among they start losing hope and their better judgment, and life seems a lot harder."	3	2		3																					
464	3	In this story it seems as if everything is dry. The rider would be getting real thirsty. He is all by himself that would make any man feel strong, because if you have an ascedent that nobody would be there to help. Hes going up and down steep hills so he would have to be careful.	1	1		1																					
465	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For instance, If you were cycling in a very cold climate you wouldn�t sweat as much and wouldn�t need to drink as much water, but in the story the cyclist is in a very hot climate and he runs out of water, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sps,wide cings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realizating that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�� This quote explains that the setting of the cycling plays a huge role in the cyclist. Also, the terrain can affect biker. If one was to ride on a flat terrain is gonna put much wear�and tear on the cyclists body therefore the flat terrain would be easier. All of those reasons explains that the settings affect the cyclist in many  ways.	2	2		2																					
466	3	The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men�s �town� was now abandoned. ��(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled�� This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When �a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a �sad, hopeless laugh.� The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water.	3	3		3																					
467	3	In the passage �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� the setting must definetly affects the cyclist. When the cyclist comes for the first abandured �town� he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid �when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� The makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water it is just undrinkable. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist in on his last legs he must work even harder to get water a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,� this quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist most perservere. Also quote �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridicuosly large snake ��tumble weeds and snakes give the feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is what the cyclist is this point. The setting of this story directly correalates with how the cyclist is feeling.	3	3		3																					
468	3	The hot day in June riding a bike in the desert. The cyclist rode off into the sun on his way to Yosemite National Park. The old men told him where to go on the map even though they had not been through that way in years. When the cyclist started his day off ready to go. He thought he would be able to stop and get water regulary but as he found out he was in the middle of the desert with no water around. The man pushed himself and stopped thinking about water. He even put pebbles in his mouth to suck on so he would be able to keep his mind off water. The man was very smart in this situation and knew what to do. This experence has made him stronger.	2	3		3																					
469	3	FLAT ROADS, HILLS, BUILDING - ALL ARE SETTINGS THAT AFFECTED THE CYCLIST. WHILE THE HILLS WERE FLAT THE CYCLIST WAS DETERMINED HE COULD MAKE IT AND WASN�T GOING TO GIVE UP ON HIMSELF. WHEN THE HILLS GOT BIGGER AND HARDER TO PEDAI, HE BEGAN TO GET EXHAUSTED AND TIRED. LASTLY, THE BUILDINGS WERE WHAT MADE HIM WANT TO GIVE UP. WHEN HE SEES THE BUILDING OF THE WELCH�S GRAPE JUICE FACTORY AND THE YOUNG BOY DRINKING HE �HUNG HIS HEAD.� HE WAS GETTING MORE TIRED AS HE WENT ALONG. THE LAND WAS MAKING HIM FEEL AS IF HE DIDN�T WANT TO KEEP MOVING ALONG.	2	2		2																					
470	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and he was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the �ghost town� and bait shop he says, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story. 	2	2		2																					
471	3	It think  it means  to be all you can be.	0	0		0																					
472	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because of how hot it is, how big the hill is and the shortage of cold water. For example it is so hot that the cyclist does not think he is going to make it. Also all he could do was a water depleting @NUM1. Also the hills became so big he crested the first couple until the sign jumped out saying rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly he had some rough terrain to ride over and no water he was at a dehydrated state and he could only do a water depleting @NUM1 when the speed limit was @NUM3. 	2	2		2																					
473	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by causing him to become dehidrated and start to lose conciousness. For ex. the town he was suposed to comue to was just an abandoned factory and he had to travlle another @NUM1 miles or so with no water.	1	1		1																					
474	3	The humid climate and hot weather will want to make you keep over if you don�t have water in your possesion. Like near the end of the essay the person sucked on stones to try retain water better which never heard about it its time. This weather is the cause of the character ??? dihydration which is a symptom of lack of water in the body.	1	1		1																					
475	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because in paragraph @NUM1 it say that the temperture was was getting high and that when he drank the water that it test like battery acid. This would affect him because it it was so hot and the water was starting to get hot how would he be able to get through the day with out pasing out also in paragraph @NUM2 it say the roads changed to hill when you ride up and down the hills you become tired from pumping you legs then you would feel hot and tiredd and would not want to ride the bike. That how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
476	3	The cyclist in the story is @CAPS1 affected by the fatause of setting in the story. The Hill afected him becaus they have harder to get over.	2	2		2																					
477	3	"The features of the setting, or environment, in which the cyclist is in greatly affects him. First of all, after leaving the campground with directions from the older gentlemen, he enters an area that is greatly isolated. In paragraph @NUM1, he wrote, ""This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time but on @TIME1, it fit the traditonal definition of a ghost town. ""This state of being alone later affected the cyclist because his increasing dehydration was becoming dangerous; if he were to collapse, he would most likely die. This drove the cyclist to continue on in order to survive. Another aspect that affected him was the extremely hot temperature. In paragraph, he implies the weather is hot by telling the reader he is traveling through to California desert in June. The heat gives the cyclist another obstacle to overcome in his struggling to get to the next town for water. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he mention the terrain changes to gently rolling hills. This shows the physical and metaphorical obstacles must get over the heat and isolation, but must also find the mental drive and determination to carry on. "	2	3		3																					
478	3	The setting affect the cyclist in alot of ways one way is that if you dont know where your going you could get hurt. Also is if the road condition are very bad. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
479	3	In this essay features of the setting affect the cyclist in his journey to get to Yosemite makes it worse. Firts for example the cyclist was in the high deserts of California in the heat of June. Which makes it bad because of the heat makes it harder on the cyclist. Also being in the deserts there wasn�t any watwer supply so after the cyclist ran out of water it got worse because he got dyhigerated, and caused him to become weaker and not pedal as fast. Also the author says that the tarren changes from flat roads, to short rolling hills, which also made it more difficult because the short hills made it more work, and since it was so hot and he didn�t have water he couldn�t funcation as well as if he was hydrated.	2	2		2																					
480	3	The features in the setting of this story affect the cyclist very much so. Throughout this story this poor person has to get lost and end up in the middle of nowhere. By her being out her cycle was being affected. She was just trying to get somewhere and get things done, but of course she didn�t. She kept moving on down. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it bad.	1	1		1																					
481	3	In this story, the cyclist had to ride threw the desert, during june and with little water. I would say that this has a big effect on the cyclist since he dehydrates alot and is threatened with heatstroke. Also he had to ride careful past a huge snake which could have hurt him. Personally I don�t know what he was doing ride threw the dessert by himself, and that�s his problem.	2	2		2																					
482	3	"In the @CAPS1 ""Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit"" many ways affect the cyclist. Three of those things are heat, lack of water, mud its anything town. The heat affects him because he gets extremely hot and tired. For example the text states."" I could die form a heatstroke on a gergeous day in June."" this shows that it was extremly hot. The cyclist had a lack of water and was very thirsty. For example it states in the text."" I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This shows that he was very thirsty from lack of water. The last way the setting affects the cyclist is when he goes into a town and tieds it empty. The text states,"" on that morning it fit the traditional detinition at a ghost town."" This show that he expected it to be there so he could rest but it wasn't like it was appare to be things all show how the setting affected th cyclist."	2	2		2																					
483	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a couple of ways. The first and main way was that he was riding through the dessert. This caused him to sweat badly and get very dehydrated. The seconded way was that there were rough roads and hilly snotts this made him more tired faster. In conclusion the setting did not help him not one little bit.	2	2		2																					
484	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map. He almost died because he listened to the old men and didn�t look at his map. If the cyclist was in a car mabey he would have better luck because he would be going  faster than the @NUM1 bike.	3	3		3																					
485	3	Many things on the cyclist journey affected him. It was in the middle of summer in California. The heat is unbeleivable and rediculously hot. �� I could drop from heatstroke�� he was so bad overheated and dyhdrated that he could of died any minute. He could have also been killed by a giant snake. ��look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement�� It could have easily killed him, if he wasn�t careful. But with his determination and spite he pulled threw and made it to a fresh supply of water. If he would have gaven up his life would have been over.	3	3		3																					
486	3	When the cyclist went to ask about the road the old men told him all its good way that he should go. But the old man hasn�t seen the land in a really long time. The man don�t long that the land has changed. So when the cyclist went back to ride the roads and everything ends ?? the cyclist didn�t know what to do.  	1	1		1																					
487	3	There are many reasons how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. There are ways mentally and physically. The ways mentally is that the cyclists can loose determination and pride if they cannot fight the journey of cycling. The ways physically is the setting is hot and rough and the cyclist would have lack of water and food supplies. Those were the ways how cyclist would be affected by the features of the setting both mentally and physically. 	2	2		2																					
488	3	The cyclist in �Rough road Ahead� was riding his bike in the middle of June, and in California. Both are very bad if you are lost and on a bike. This is because in June it usually hot, and I know in @CAPS1 it�s usually always hot, The cyclist is on a bike this means he has to pedde everywhere he goes. This is not along going to use up all his energy but also make him hot, And when your this hot you need to keep hydrated. But your lost so if you use all your water before you find safty then your in major trouble. Also In California theres like Hills, and mountains and stoff and peddling up a mountain isn�t an easy trick.	1	2		2																					
489	3	The features of the cyclist affect him in many ways. One way that the features affected him was that when he ran out of water all the buildings were like a ghost town. He said that there was no one in sight. In the story it says �the bulding abandoned years earlier.� If I was him I would of turned around and went back so I would take the chance of not dieing out in the middle of an abandoned area.	1	1		1																					
490	3	The setting is the main factor on effects on the cycleist. The cycleist�s main problem is that he is low on water & dehydrated, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� The author wouldn�t have been so dehydrated if it weren�t so hot. Also, all the problems he faces are setting related like the snake & the rough road. If it would have taken place in a more mild area, there wouldn�t have been any conflicts.	2	2		2																					
491	3	In the story the cyclist is afected by setting because in the @NUM1 paragraph it talks about him seeing the old water pump and how he was trying to get water out. At the end of the story he gets angry when he sees the old welches juice factory because he relizes that the old men didn�t know what they were talking about. Also at the end he is realived when he finds Gary and @ORGANIZATION1 because there is water there. 	1	1		1																					
492	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie in a very profound way. While he is riding, he sees surrounding him� no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� When he realizes his solitude when he is in a state of almost dehydration, he despairs. As a result of the seclution of the setting, having only seen �One ramshackle shed in many miles, the cyclist almost looses hope. However, hope is renewed when he thinks of �the cool pines and rushing rivers of @CAPS1.� That is how the cyclist is affected by his setting, and despair is turned to hope.	2	2		2																					
493	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it�s very hot outside and he is starting to loose energy. The setting affects how fast he rides when he stops or when he drinks or eats. all of these depend on the type of weather he is riding in. like in the story it was so hot out when he saw a building he wiped the sweat from his face to make sure it wasn�t a mirage.	1	1		1																					
494	3	In the essay �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The features of the setting had a great affect on the hard-working cyclist. The weather land and surrounding objects really determined the cyclists mood and ability. One example would be the statement, �cool pines, rushing rivers of upsemite had my name written all over them.�The refreshing nature and cool air made the cyclist feel confident energized and ready. Another example would be the quote, �One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest Mule greet me.�there, the cyclist feels troubled and alittle curious as to what lay ahead this water wasn't not the best and he was worried. The last example was, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills...tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� there, the cyclist tries to stay focused through distractions. It is deserted and he feels dehydrated as well. As his route ends he comes across in manymore aspects of the setting which create a different feeling or ability. Therefore the nature of where his bike passed, and the things he saw affected his choices and ability.	3	3		3																					
495	3	There are many features in the setting that affect the cycleist, one of which is that he is in the middle of California riding his bike in the sun with a limited ammount of water. It affects the cyclist because he almost collapses from heatstroke and lack of water. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
496	3	The features of the setting in this essay affected the cyclist in many ways. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expecting a small town with people in it and some type of good water supply. However he instead found a deserted ghost town with only a rusty pump that didn�t even supply water. It made the cyclist feel depressed because he was running low on water and could easily dehydrate without it. �The speed limit was @NUM2. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM3. sometimes life can feel so cruel.� (Kurmaskie @NUM4). The cyclist is possibly being passed by cars on the highway going @NUM2 while he is only going @NUM3.This probably makes him feel as if he is getting no where at all. It would be all the more reason for him to give up. But he keeps trying to reach his destination. The feeling of being passed by the cars makes him determined to continue and finish his journey.	2	2		2																					
497	3	The cyclist had very little water. It was very hot. He had a long way to go. The road was very bumpy so he couldn�t go to fast or he�s tire�s might bust. There were know cars in site so if he did break down it would have taken even longer.	1	1		1																					
498	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions	3	2		3																					
499	3	On the cyclist way to Yosemite National Park, he is given directions from a group of old men, but their direction aren�t so good. The desserted place affected him because there was no where for him to stop and eat or refill his water bottle �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. There were rusted water pump�s, with hot water, but nothing to cool him down. His surroundings led him to the state of dehydration.	2	2		2																					
500	3	The features of the setting including vast emptiness, hills, heat, and no water all create obstacles for the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� @CAPS1 to the vast emptiness of the area in which he was traveling he could not stop somewhere to ask for help or to take a rest. Also there were no other travelers so he could not ask for assistance from them. Another obstacle during his trip are the hills. It takes more energy to pedal up hill so he ends up tiring easily and taking longer than expected. There is also extreme heat which causes him to sweat and even become even more thirsty. So he ends up running out of water. In the story he writes, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He is now becoming thirsty and if he doesn�t find water he @MONTH1 dehydrate. He searches for a place to rest where there @MONTH1 be water but he is not able to. All of these obstacles cause the cyclist to become devastated and give up hope but he continues his travel and eventually finds a place to rest. All of these obstacles tying into another.	3	3		3																					
501	3	I really thought the story didn�t make sense the setting was crazy I really wasn�t feeling it at all I don�t think it was even a good story	0	0		0																					
502	3	The features of the setting affect a cyclist in many ways. If you have a bumpy ride, then the cyclist will have a harder time. also, if it is really hilly, then it is harder and will take longer too. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� It will take him longer to reach his destination. animals in the setting can also be effective.� and a ridiculously, large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� animals can get in the way like this snake did for the cyclist. If a squirrel or some kind of animal was to run across the rode right infront of you, it could scare you and you could clash. Sometimes trees make it cooler because you don�t have to sun beating directly down on your back. If there is a fresh water stream you can stop and wash all the sweat off of you and get a drink. The setting in which is cyclist is riding, can help or hurt the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
503	3	It affected him by dehydrating him and wearing him down to the point where he was about to give up. But he never gave up. As the end sartisfaction came out of it all.	1	1		1																					
504	3	The trees were in the landscape and it was making the colors red and the volcanoes and the tall pine trees covered were in the landscape and milker years ago it make the swampland became the desert	1	1		1																					
505	3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement �I was travelling through the high deserts of California.� not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement �I was travelling in June.� @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, �blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also �had the flavor of battery acid.� This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he �had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.� The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink.	3	3		3																					
506	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� the cyclist was excited and determined to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist had to be thinking of the beautiful waters with �His name written over them�. The rough terrain and harsh weather took its affection on the unaware cyclist. The sun, beat down on the cyclist back, he tried to ignore it, but soon the heat made him frequently drink his water away to sips to drink. The cyclist was told by the old man a town was only @NUM1 miles aways. The town was the traditional definition of a ghost town. �That probably gave the cyclist no hope for surviving of finding anyone to help him reach his destination. The conditions of the roads, the lack of water which made him see a mirage, made the cyclist not trust the words of an old man who had led him to the abandon locations he had seen. The cyclist was affected by the settings in a bad way but in the end was given a little help from a traditional map.	3	3		3																					
507	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected the cyclist because it made it more difficult for the cyclist to survive and make it through his journey. In the essay, it says, �I arrived at the first �Town��this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time�but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost @NUM1). In the essay, the cyclist takes directions from a few old men to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist has a limited amount of water, and it was a very humid day for traveling. Because of the humidity, the cyclist nearly ran out of water when he had to cycle up, �short, rolling hills� (@NUM2) in the hot weather. Had the town been thriving, he could have bought more water to make his trip easier to accomplish. Also, if the road in the story would have been flat, he cyclist wouldn�t have gotten as tired as he did and needed more water. It would have been less strainful on the cyclist to pedal on a flat road rather than a hilly road. The challenges facing the cyclist remined me of that of the main character of the movie @PERSON2. In this movie, the main character must make his way through the extreme conditions of the desert, just like the cyclist had to in order to reach his destination. In conclusion, the setting clearly affects the cyclist�s journey in a negative way.	3	3		3																					
508	3	In the story, �Rough Road Ahead�, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the setting. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert like area, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through.	2	2		2																					
509	3	In the selection �Do not exceed posted speed limit� there are a lot of great details of the area around the cyclist. In the text, it makes it clear that the route the cyclist is traveling is very deserted when the drinking water was explained as oozing out and tasting like battery acid, you can tell that people hadn�t been there in awhile. Also, being informed that he was traveling through a desert, in June. I am able to understand how thirsty he is. Also, he is traveling for miles over a rough terrain and �crippling hills,� according to the text, so he has to be ovely exhausted. I could understand why he was so upset with getting wrong directions based on the troubles he encounters when he finally reaches the camp and drinks water, you too are glad he has reached somewhere that wasn�t empty and deserted.	2	3		3																					
510	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the he was traveling through a hot place at a hot time of year and didn�t have much water. In the text it says �I was traveling the high desserts of California in June.� The deserts are always hot and June is a very hot month. The cyclist was getting thirsty quicker from the heat and wasn�t able to drink much because he had limited water.	1	1		1																					
511	3	The setting affected the cyclist because since it was the California desert, and it was in June, it was very hot and dry. Which caused him to get very thirsty and drink all his water. After almost all his water was gone, he began to get very tired, and since it is the desert, there isn�t any one around to help him if he dehydrates and blacks out, so he has to persevere and really push through the situation if he wants to survive. But he eventually finds a bait shop and he has a drink there so he is okay.	2	2		2																					
512	3	In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the setting greatly affects the cyclist. With long rides, hilly roads, and very little water the cyclist was pretty good. I mean he could have been very angry but he kept his cool and stayed calm.	1	1		1																					
513	3	The towns, the terrain, the Welch�s Grape Juice factory- all are parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war,� describes the cyclist, �but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� The town intensifies the cyclist feeling of doubt, in that it is increasing. At this part, he is really regretting taking the old guy's advice in taking the �shortcut.� �Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing,� reveals the cyclist. The cyclist is already very worried and very doubtful, and the terrain is making it worse it mirrors the town in which the cyclist had stopped at earlier to, again make his feeling of doubt increase. The cyclist exclaims, � By the looks of it- had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory.� The cyclist gets very excited when he sees this, and gets a great feeling of hope. So throughout the whole story, the setting of where the cyclist is at affects his mood by giving him doubt, but by also giving him hope.  	3	3		3																					
514	3	The cyclist was biking through the California deserts olwing the warm summer months. The heat and uninhabited canal was the biggest struggle for the cyclist. For example, he thought there would be many stops for water decive his trip, but he was mistaken. Also he runs out of water very quickly because of being dehydrated in the heat. The cyclist became irritated with himself for trusting someone else to give him directions for a shortcut. The setting affected the cyclist�s mood in a negative way.  	2	2		2																					
515	3	There were many features in the setting of this bike race that affected the cyclist. It stated, �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was  pedaling fine until these big hills came into affect and his energy was running lower as he went along. Also it stated,� At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� (Kurmaskie @NUM2). This debris and snake made him stop because he got scared and slowed him down. There was a lot of features in the setting that made the cyclist affected to slow him down and lose energy.	2	2		2																					
516	3	Many things caneffect a cyclist and how they ride, in this essay many things effected him such as the setting of the story. One of the problems of the setting was there were no stores or even people, another and most important thing was the lack of water around him, so many things can effect a cyclist while They are riding inculding there suriondings.	2	3		3																					
517	3	The second photograph better communicates ideas similar to the ideas expressed in the essay �A sea worry �, because the story is about a boy who surfs as a job & in the second picture a boy is surfing. The author says �my son body-surfs. He says it�s his �job�. That quote was explaining that he�s a body-surfer & it�s his occupation. This is the reason I chose the secod photograph.	1	2		2																					
518	3	Condition the cyclist is in affect a lot of how they ride. One example of this is, �I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.� @CAPS1 to this fact the cyclist had went into a �dehydrated state� because of not having much water. When your travelling in hot weather areas without much water your body will become dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists diffently.	1	1		1																					
519	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead.� First, the scorching heat of the desert  in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of dehydration. In the text it states, �I could drop from heatstroke in a gorgeous day in June (@CAPS1).� This shows the effect the exposure  to heat had on @NUM1 cyclist. Also, the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story. In the text it says �I toiled on( @CAPS2).� This shows the increase in effort in strain the  terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure.	2	2		2																					
520	3	In the story �Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being hott affected him because it mad him more thirsty. Than him being out in the middle of the desert made it so he couldn�t get any water. The hills made him tired and weak. All of the features in the setting had an affect on him, which made him powerless and thirsty.	1	2		2																					
521	3	The features that effect the cyclist are that he is riding his bike in the desert and doesnt have any water. That effects his journey because he is dehydrated so he needs to find water fast so it is making him get to Yosemite slower because he needs to find water. That is a feature that affects the cyclist	1	1		1																					
522	3	In the story the setting has a large affect on the cyclist. After taking advice from old people he ended up in the desert with no cars, buildings, or peopl. He was running low on water and had no way of getting anymore, and he was really dehydrated, he got really tired and almost gave up because of the heat and lack of water. All this was caused by the setting he was in.	2	1		2																					
523	3	The setting of the place was �ghost town� as the author said. It was a hot summer day in June so of course the cyclist would be dehydrating. There was no one around so he couldn�t ask for help. It was like an old town because he ran into old men who knew nothing of new world because they told him the wrong directions.	1	1		1																					
524	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a few different ways. At first it helped him. �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers� This is saying the pines and rivers helped him forget the sun. Later on the setting was against him. There was no place to get water and he was becoming dehydrated the terrain was getting rougher. There were no people around to help him, but there was a snake. All these features were working against him until he finally made it to a bait store. This bait store gave him water and a good map.  	2	2		2																					
525	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead by Joe @PERSON1 it tells of a cyclist heading for Yosemite National Park, and the problems he faced. For example the heat was a major issue the cyclist had to face. In the story it said �Drop from heatstroke.� this shows the setting affected him in a negative way, in the story heat was a major part of the setting that affected the character.	2	1		2																					
526	3	The features of the setting affected the author�s story a lot. It affected it by making the trip seem more difficult to the reader. This was made possible by telling how hot it was and explaining how the road was full of bumps or hills. The story says �over one long, crippling hill.� This makes the reader think the trip is very hard since he has to ride up so many hills. But if the road wasn�t as hilly then the trip would seem less difficult. This would also make it as if that the old guys gave good directions. But the whole point.	1	1		1																					
527	3	As soon as the cyclist gained information about which way to go, he set off through tall, cool pines. They  gave him a feeling of confidence, and physically cooled his body down. As he headed down the road, he encountered various small towns-none of which looked promising- which gave him a feeling of despair, in accordance to his lack of water. Even further  into. the journey, he found one last town, and arundown welche�s  @CAPS1 factory. This increased his thirst and gave him a feeling of spite towards the old men who had given him advice. However, he soon found a bait house where he could get water and escape the heat. For this he was satisfied and grateful to the owner. It made him realize to never again trust the old men.	3	3		3																					
528	3	The setting affects alot in a cyclist. For example if you are in a city you seel rush tired and everweled. But in a forest you are happy and a bit less stress. A setting sets the mode also the attude in the story.	1	1		1																					
529	3	The features of the setting affect the authors dispotion as well as his ability to complete the journey, thus creating an obstacle the author must overcome. At the end of the paragraph five the author writes that �I was traveling through the high deserts of California.� This setting is important because it adds a sense of urgency to his trip when he starts to run low on water. This is similair to when I was backpacking and a bear got most of our food. Our normal backpacking trip had become more of a game of survival. So, the water issue was clearly the main point of of conflict that the author presented in the setting. He also writes that �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This aspect of the setting also affects the cyclist because it makes it much harder for him to progress than if it was a downhill road. In short, the setting of the story presents the main points of conflict to the author and thus was essential to the essay.	3	3		3																					
530	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist�s own words, � things began well enough.� @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, �got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.� He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him.	2	2		2																					
531	3	"The cyclist is effected by the setting in �Rough Road Ahead"" because the road is a place and if it is rough or unknown, its a direct effect on the traveler, who is the cyclist. If it is a hill then the cyclist would have to climb it. In the text it said , �over a long crippling hill,� the crippiling hill part stresses that the setting is a hill."	1	1		1																					
532	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because there is mo water, hills, and deserts. When the cyclists saw water a wanting to jump in all he thought about was water that they lack like battery acid.Then the hills slowed him down from the water. The desert just made him want water even more. That are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
533	3	There were many features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One was the extreme heat during the June heat in California. The speaker said that he could have died from heatstroke. The rough road was also a problem for the cyclist. The bumps, hills and wildlife affected the cyclist�s journey. The thing that most affected him was the lack of water. It was such a problem that he had to suck on stones to take his mind off thirst. As you can see, these problems in the story affected the speaker�s journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
534	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is riding in the desert where there is low to rain. This means that he can�t collect any water to drink if he runs out. Also, deserts are hot. The heat will speed up the dehydration process so he will need more water to survive. If he runs out of water, he will die. The cyclist finds a building, but it is abandoned and empty. All these features of the setting affect him. Since he can�t find water, he has to conserve what he has. Also, the heat is killing him. It doesn�t help to have an abandoned building be the only one he finds. During the whole time that there is death in the air, the desert with nothing growing, no water, the cyclist is thinking about his death. As long as he thinks about his death, there is only more death. As soon as he puts the pebbles in his mouth to stop thinking about death and being thirsty, he sees a bait shop which saves his life. He thought about his surviving, and immediately found a shop to and he could drink.	2	3		3																					
535	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly throughout his ride. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke (pG @NUM1 kurmaskie).� This quote is saying that because of the heat, the rough terrain and the length of his �shortcut� his running out of water. That�s when he realizes he could die from heatstroke because he listened to a bunch of old men.	2	2		2																					
536	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is in the desert and has a low supply of water. Without water he tired very easily .On top of that he had to pedal a bicicle. So he was thirsty and tired prambeing in the desert. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
537	3	Setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist has to worry about the road condition. If the road condition is bad then the cyclist must reduce his/her speed. The cyclist also has to worry about if it is day or night. If it is night, they must be careful due to cars not being able to see them. In the text, the cyclist was in extremely hot weather. This is dangerous to cyclist if they are not prepared with things such as water.	1	1		1																					
538	3	"The setting affects the cyclist because the cyclist believes that he has a nice, short, flat distance to travel to get to Yosemite but instead it is a long, hilly(rough),  hot journey. He only prepared himself for a quick ride, bringing only enough water for that ride, and wasn�t prepared for the reality of his ride. First of all he is riding in the middle of the day (the hottest part) in the �high deserts of colifornia in June� I know when I go to camp here in @LOCATION1 during the summer I drink I drink six to seven liters, but the author only mentions a ""few bottles of water"" which aren't going to help him in that heat. Secondly, the cyclist believed that the old men had given him a safe path to follow but instead he came across a �ridiculously large snake. It really looked like a diamond back� That is a poisonous snake and the cyclist has barely able to �ease post� it because, of his lack of water. Lastly, the cyclist expected the old men to give him an easy path on a flat terrain when in fact it was �replaced by short, rolling hills� which means you have to put more effort (using more water) to climb the hills. The setting definetely affects the cyclist because it makes it more difficult for him to reach his destination but without a few bumps in the road, how is he to learn a life lesson?"	3	3		3																					
539	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting a lot. For example the dry hot place makes him thirsty. Then the ghost towns make it hard to get supplies. Also the bad road slowed him down. The bad roads even would probably hurt him and his bike the roads also would make him work harder.	1	1		1																					
540	3	The features of the setting affected the cycalist in many bad ways. For example in the text it says how �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�. Meaning that he had trouble being in a place he didn�t know well of and he was dehydrated. In conclusion the setting did affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
541	3	First the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem. That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn�t trust the guy. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desteart road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn�t attack him. Finally the biker faced his  las long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water.	2	2		2																					
542	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting by making him feel worse than he does. The cyclist is lost, has only found dirty water, and is moving on rough ground. The features of the setting are �cool pines and rushing rivers,� however, the cyclist comes to find that the �rushing river� is not so refreshing. He also encounters a terrain change, from flat road to short, rolling hills. There is a sign, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� also the name of the passage with a limit of 55 mph, while the cyclist is only going 12 mph. Ironically, he finds a picture of a boy drinking grape juice at the factory, which cause him to hang his head in misery due to his intense thirst. Finally, he comes to a fish camp, where he encounters the owner who, ironically, tells him he�d be better off using his map.	2	1		2																					
543	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water. The ghost town doesn�t help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abanded. This is how the features affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
544	3	Features of the setting would affect me if I was the cyclist because, I would be thinking I was going to die just like he did because, there is nothing to look at, no breeze, wind, he seen a snake, he had no water. He went through three towns that had nothing. The sun was setting down on him, it was hot, he had no hope. Who knows, maybe if he would have just went with what the map had said, he would have been fine.	2	2		2																					
545	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is running out of water and is in the intense heat in �the high deserts of California in June. The tumbleweeds that cross his path add to the desperation. Not only do the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically by dehydrating him in the heat, but also mentally. The cyclist encounters rolling hills, tumbleweeds rattle snakes and ghost towns. All of these make the cyclist start to give up hope. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist physically and mentally.	2	2		2																					
546	3	The features of the setting greatly impacted the cyclist. First the setting at the middle of the story was empty and no place to get water. This filled the cyclist with doubt and despair, he/she thought they would die. The setting also made the cyclist thirsty because of the extreme heat. Finally the cyclist was filled with regret because they regretted listening to the old men because the cyclist didn�t make it where he/she wanted to go.	2	2		2																					
547	3	The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.	2	2		2																					
548	3	The setting really affected the cyclist. Since he was in the desert on a bike he was going to be hot and tired. Which would come from the sun coming down on him. You know he was hot where it said �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.�	1	1		1																					
549	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they are extreme and do not change. The cyclist was riding on a small road in the desert. In the desert it was very hot and because of this the cyclist was sweating a lot and getting dehydrated. Also because he was in the desert he had no sense of direction. Also the towns are all run down with nothing in them, so the cyclist couldn�t get any water to drink to rehydrate himself. Only when he comes to a small bait shop close he finally get water.	2	2		2																					
550	3	"The setting really afeted the cyclist alot.The sun and hot weather dehidrated him. He also had pretty much ran out of water. In the story he says ""The bottles contained only a few drops this shows that he had drank almost all of his water. Then it says ""the growing relization that I could drop from a leaf stroke"" shows the heat was affecting him."	2	2		2																					
551	3	The setting was calm and peaceful as he started out riding his bike. He was smiling and his legs were strong. As he hit the @NUM1 town and saw a ramshackled shed, rusty pumps, and a corral, he begun to be troubled b/c he was running out of water. As the flat rodes were replaced wI short, rolling hills he became even more troubled.  When he saw a building he became happy but when he found out it was run down he was sad, thirsty, and tired. When he finally saw an old man and told him he had a map he became a little happier b/c he was going to get to Yosemite. As the setting became worse his mood became worse b/c he had less and less water and felt very hopeless. But when he saw the man he became happy b/c the map was going to help him.	2	2		2																					
552	3	The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn�t get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few �tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge,� By the lols of it had been a Welch�s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory.� He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a �Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.� There is only the problems it is abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth. This was to help tabe his mind off being thirst.	3	2		3																					
553	3	I read �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� written by Joe Kurmaskie in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by accepting advice from �old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches @CAPS1 was in office�	1	1		1																					
554	3	In the essay �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First, the sun is making the cyclist hot and dehydrated. He states �The sun was beginning to beat down,� @CAPS1, the sun was a big factor on the affect on the cyclist. Also, the hills of the country roads. Going up and down hills take alot of work you have to use alot of energy. The cyclist says �@CAPS2 were replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS3, there were snakes in the road, which make the cyclist timid looking out for snakes so he would not get bit. Againg the cyclist states �dimond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS4, there was an old factory that gave the cyclist hope and then crushed his hopes. The factory even made him more thirsty. @CAPS1, there were many affects on the cyclist due to the setting.	2	3		3																					
555	3	The features of the setting take their toll on the unfortunate cyclist. For example.� I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� The deserts of California especially in June are hot and dry and caused the cyclist to use much of his water supply, very quickly. As he �toiled� on, the terrain features became even more trying,� over one long, crippling hill��By this time the cyclist barely had enough energy to make it over a hill from all the wear and tear his body was put through by the features of his setting.	2	2		2																					
556	3	The settings to this story has an encouraging impact on this story, because he is an alike ride. The terrain in the story sounds rough where he seen a sign marked, �Rough road ahead do note exceed posted speed limit.� He already has to go up and down hills with rocks and no water. Such a setting an a really athletic ride can be devastating. 	1	1		1																					
557	3	The feature of the cyclist and the settings arn�t that good. There�re insidents that are a problem. One is the bad weather. There is a tempature that makes it feels pretty close to @NUM1 degrees. He stops at a water pump, water comes out but it is really not cool. He takes two little sips and its like battarey acid. If he would to drink alot of that water it would probably kill him or make him very ill. He needs something because there was another town @NUM2 miles down the road so he has to find something to keep him going. As he is going down the road he sees a sign: Rough Road Ahead: Even though he is going 12 mph he could still hit a hole and go flying over his handle bars. If he does go over his handle bars he could run into the snake he saw then get eaten by the birds because he wouldn�t have any energic to get up. There�re some interesting sence in the story.	2	2		2																					
558	3	Heat, water supply, energy-all are features of setting that can affect a cyclist. First, is heat. When it is too warm out it makes it more difficult, and more inconvenient to ride. Second, is your water supply. If you are riding, and begin to run low on water, your in trouble. The author describes, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips�. If you arn�t prepared enough for your cycling journey, it will be extremely inconvenient when you run out of supplies. Lastly, is energy. If you run out of energy while cycling, you have nothing. Your energy is what keeps you moving and motivated. �With what I believe, was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� the author describes. When you are out of energy, your ride is over. all of these aspects are important to have before deciding to go on a cycling journey.	2	2		2																					
559	3	The features of the setting affect the setting affect the cyclist by. Dehydrating him due to the heat and lack of water and to see mirages. And he loses strength going over the many hills. And there is a very large snake he has to ride by that could have bitten him.	1	1		1																					
560	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when you have hills to climb and little water, you will get dehydrated. Also the heat from the desert is so hot that it also can make you dehydrated. If you don�t  pace yourself and dont drink too much water you will be able to reach your goal. Your rest is a big thing for if you dont have energy, you will not get far.	0	0		0																					
561	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the hills made it hard for him to ride his bike up and he was afraid of the grass becase it was tall and scary looking.	1	1		1																					
562	3	In the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed limit� a cyclist takes a journey through terrain to get to Yosemite. In that part of California there are not a lot of towns or people. The rode he is rideing on is very dangerous and long. It is very dry and hot out there but	2	2		2																					
563	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in a lot of ways. One way setting affects cyclist is when it is hot, it is harder to cycle long distances. I say this because in the story the narrator says ��and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke�� @CAPS1 part of setting that affects cyclist is the terrain they cycle on. For example it is much easy to cycle on flat smooth ground than it is on the rolling hills with rough, rocky ground. This is shown with the quote ��ride down into distances I could see over the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine.� Setting can have a great deal of affect on a cyclist, depending on if its smooth or rocky, or hot or cool. 	2	2		2																					
564	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed the Speed Limit� the features of the setting affects the cyclist a great deal. Each feature causing the cyclist to act. For example, in reaching the �ramshackle shed� the cyclist finds the water inusuable; which causes to conserve water and try to head for the next town. That action leads him deeper into the high deserts of California during June. Also as the terrain changes from flat road to short, rolling hills the cyclist must change his speed to better survive and continue in his dehydrated state. The scarcity of buildings in this dry desert terrain causes the cyclist to try every �shack or building he comes across for water. In this story the features of the setting dictates the actions of the cyclist in his quest to survive in the desert a lot.	2	2		2																					
565	3	The cyclist in the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� is about a great adventure gone bad. He has every thing he needs but some how it turns out bad. He get low on water & the setting is horrible. He is on his way from a camp ground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite river. He gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns & was running out of water then he came to a sign that said, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� He was pedeling over hills & becoming dehydrated when he tought he was going to die he came to a bait shop & got waiter & met an old guy who was going to give him direction & he decided he better stick to the map. Even though the setting got worse through the story & stuck it out & made it to the end.	3	2		3																					
566	3	Heat, hills and ghost towns � all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, the heat dehydrates and exhausts him, almost causing him a heat stroke. He starts dinking more often, and nearly runs out of water. Next is the hills. They can take massive amounts of energy to climb. Which adds to his dehydration. Finally the ghost towns. They make his journey seem hopeless. Which could cause him to lose the will to carry on.	2	2		2																					
567	3	The cyclist is in the desert which @NUM1 degrees with water that tastes like the battery acid. The desert makes him see the mirages having sweat get into his eyes. In the story  �Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie 	1	1		1																					
568	3	In the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the author tells a story about when he took advice from �old folks� and became lost. The setting greatly affected him and his journey, for example �tumbleweeds crossed my path, and a ridiculously large snake�� and a �crippling hill� these quotes explain that the setting was quite scary.	1	1		1																					
569	3	He�s on a very hot climate, in a desert, so he needs lots of water, but he has a limited supply. He�s riding on hills, which makes it even harder. He can�t find any towns that aren�t abandoned.	2	2		2																					
570	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him was time because of the road he had to go slower so took him longer to get to the town. Also because the road was harder to peddle on he got thristy and the water was really hot.	1	1		1																					
571	3	There were several features of the setting that held an affect on the cyclist in this story. For one, the cyclist was riding in a hot desert. This condition normally prevents one from obtaining water. Seeing as how water was a necessity for the cyclist, the lack there at due to the desert created the conflict of dehydration. Additionally, the town that was abandoned triggered a spark of doubt in the cyclist�s mind. The cyclist now had to ride with his brain in doubt and his body in desperate hope. By the time he/she reaches the old factory, the cyclist is extremely dehydrated. Now his head is screaming with annoyance and his body is screaming with lack of water. This abandoned juice factory almost completely wiped out the cyclist hope. A man is little to nothing without hope. Therefore, this abandoned factory had a negative affect on him. Now, the only reason he continues is out of his/her desperation of survival, an instinct in all of us. In conclusion, the desert removed water and the abandoned homes and factory removed hope and all three created a negative affect. The cyclist is lucky to have survived. 	1	1		1																					
572	3	The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn�t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.	1	1		1																					
573	3	In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, he shows features of the setting played that affects the cyclist in many different ways. A setting the cyclist faces is that its so hot he keeps taking (drinking) water, and worrying that he is going to run out. Kurmaskie writes, � I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in @NUM1). This is what the cyclist gets affected by throuout the whole story as he releizes he could die of heatstroke if he dosent watch how much water hes drinking. Also, this is what a lot of people normally face which is a challenge cause of dehydration.	2	2		2																					
574	3	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place things change No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist. Never travel advice home old-timers who haven�th confines of use porches.Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit.	1	1		1																					
575	3	"Many things about the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. The terrain in this story is hilly and filled with deserts. This contributes to the cyclist nagging sensation for a drink of water. The ride on the hills and through the desert, also tire him out dramatically. Not to mention while he is severely dehydrated, and when he finds the water it is �tarlike� and ""in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�. The cyclist in this story really must want to get Yosemite National park if he is willing to go all through all this trouble. The old men he asked in Lodi, California hadn�t left the town in decades and gave the cyclist faulty directions that could of killed him. So he asked for directions and was given inadequet information, which made life very difficult for the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
576	3	The setting of �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� affect the cyclist so many ways. First of all, the cyclist is riding in a desert, in mid- June, with the heat �beginning to beat down� on him. This feature of the setting causes the cyclist to drink more water, but when his supply of water was running low, he was unable to drink much water to hydrate himself. The cyclist began to realize that he �could trap from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� @CAPS1, the long distance and changes in the terrain that the cyclist was travelling, affected him. The distance on which to cyclist was travelling to Yosemite National Park, consisted of hours and miles of riding. Over vast changes of terrain. The �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills�, which affected the cyclist speed and energy to finish his trip.	3	2		3																					
577	3	A response that explains how the features of setting affect the cyclist by getting wrong dirachion The old man. One features when tough an ghost town. The old people in the didn�t know they were tell him. It made it haede for nam because that more harder roads and lesort water. He almost died.	1	1		1																					
578	3	The features of the setting will affect the cyclist because the roads are hilly and he is old so it will be hard for him to ride up them. It was very hot and he had a scares supply of water. He was seeing things that wasn�t there. When he did try to get some water, the weather was so hot that the water from the pump came out hot.	1	1		1																					
579	3	Well some features of the setting like the hotness is effecting the cyclist, for example he was riding through the high deserts of California and was drinking to much of his water. So when he stoped at a place the pipes and things to get water were rusty and old. Another was when he thought he could make it to the other town to get water their. He started his ride the the roads were hilly and short. Then the road turned into bumpy to. So know matter what we was having bad trouble any way. 	1	1		1																					
580	3	The character in this short story has a most that changes with his surroundings. Towards the beginning when he was enjoying his ride no said �� The cool pines and rushing rivers of  Yosemite had my name all over them,�� As time goes on and he begins to realize nobody inhabits the path he is on he becomes continues and the terrain become rougher.	1	1		1																					
581	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance the desert is not a hummid making is lack of water a bigger deal than normal. Also these are many hill making him have to use full force to get up them also making water a big deal. In conclusion I temperatures where level and it was flat land he could go further with less water supply.	2	2		2																					
582	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by never accept travel advice from colletion of old timer who haven�t left there porches since carter was in office. After that because you don�t know if they are real collection or what. After because some people have not left there porches since carter was in office. I don�t know why people have not left there porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
583	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie he accepts directions from old men for a shortcut to Yosemite National Park. He ends up cycling in a desert with no water just barley able to push the pedals of his bike. The setting affects the cyclist by it being so hot, him not having anything to drink, nowhere to get water or food and him maybe seeing mirages. In the essay it states, �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke.� This shows that the lack of water and the surrounding enviroment with nowhere to go is making him give up hope to survive. It also says in the essay, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasen�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. �The cyclist is coming out himself and stating that the dessert has him thinking hes seeing something and letting him down by it not being real. The desert setting of this essay effects the cyclist in many ways other then one.	2	2		2																					
584	3	In �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie: c, I think that e the setting affected the cyclist because he was thirsty and he thought he was going to die In this case he had no water left and he was in the desert. He was regreating not taking the advice of the stranger and was dieing of thirst. Also he dident have the mind set that he wanted to live. Thats how I think the setting affectd him.    	1	1		1																					
585	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the �high desserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. �I could drop from a heatstroke,� he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist�s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. �Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact.	3	3		3																					
586	3	Nature has an affect on everyone, even when they don�t think it does. Expecially for cyclist traveling anywhere or everywhere. In �Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example about settings laffect people like cyclist. When you�re riding your bike as actually cross country transportation, you have to know what your doing and where you�re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route for a cyclist because at these �town� they had no water, because they weren�t towns to begin with, not anymore atleast. If you don�t have any water like this guy did hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example.� l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth. I�d read once that sucking on stones help take your mind off thrist� This guy knew a little bit of survival tips. If he�d gone all that way without standing up yo his thrist and those hills, he probably would have had some kind of stroke. That is just a few way that setting could harm you.  	3	3		3																					
587	3	Some of the feature setting that effect the cyclist was the seal was begging to lent down, but he truly noticed it and about twenty miles up the road he came to park of sorts. The cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June. He get on his hands and hence working on the heated handle of the rusty pump. The pump began it shoot out a tarlike substance and the water was feeling somewhere of two hundred degrees. Two more miles I noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to a short, rolling hills.� He said tumble weeds crossed her path and a large snake crossed her pavement. He gather some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, after reading that if sucking of stones helps to be your mind off thirst. Well after reading of I believed these settings did effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
588	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. First, the �town� The cyclist first comes upon is described as a ghost town. Although the cyclist chuckles about it, this setting sets up the long journey the cyclist has a head of him. There were other features that would negatively affect the cyclist. For example, ��I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� (pg @NUM1). Flat land is much easier for a cyclist to pedal on. The change from flat land to hills affected his stamena and will to keep going. He really had to push himself to trudge up and down each hill. His determination finally led him to, �Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp�� (pg @NUM2). He finally found hope.   	3	2		3																					
589	3	In the story Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the features had a more negative affect on the cyclist. The cyclist got tired because of the big hills and he liked the scene which was they only good that if had on hon. �The water bottle only contained a few tantallizg sips.� he didnt have enough water and he was thirsty. �At some point a rediculously large  snak it really did look like dimond back�bloked the majority of the pavement.� It is dangerous where he was riding and even though he was on a bike he could have been bit. All of these points I made showed the negative affect.	1	1		1																					
590	3	The desert like land affected the cyclist by making him tired and loss of body water, then that therefor making him need water to go on. I think the thought of being so thirsty made him become more weak. If he wasn�t thinking about it the ride wouldnt have bin so ruff	1	1		1																					
591	3	In the cyclist�s outlook on his journey through Yosemite�s park, reader�s can get a good feel of how it might be to be riding right along side. It seems that it is very beautiful along the bike ride. He sees such a vast variety of scenery including rivers, sandy dry deserts also, as well as cool pines and trees in the park part. He said it was also breezy which probably made for an enjoyable temperature.	1	1		1																					
592	3	The features oF the bike ride to Yosemite through California in June affect the cyclist. Some of the features were it was hot high deserts, and no water. This affected the author by making him dehydrated and tired, which made it hard for him to find water or to get to Yosemite. In this cass the outhor says �The sun was beating down on me�. The author is hot From the sun. He says �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips�. He is showing how he hasno water and is probably dehydrated. All of those features are affecting the way he is traveling and getting to water.  	2	2		2																					
593	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� there are many features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. Many of these features affect him in a negative way. One such feature is the hills that are present in the essay. These probably exasperated the cyclist even more than he already was with the sun beating down on him. Another feature was the road sign that said �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� The author/cyclist probably felt like he would never make it. Also, the sign advertising grape juice probably made him feel life was even crueler with its sadistic irony. Finally, the bait shop offered much relief to the cyclist. �I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.� All in all, the setting affected the cyclist in some pretty bad ways until the end.	2	2		2																					
594	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist. First, the heat was the main part of nature that threw him off. It caused him to go dehiderated because lack of water and he went kind of dilerious. He thought he was seeing things and his vision was distorted. Next, the water he had to come across in the pump was un drinkable because of the tarlike substance coming out of it and the degree of water he said it was, which was @NUM1 degree. Lastly, the Welch�s factory that he came across was teasing him in in the way that he couldn�t have the liquids he needed and the little boy advertised on the building was drinking his refreshed Welch�s juice. Not only did the cyclist get off track because the directions, the setting made his bike adventure to Yosemite even more unbearable.	3	2		3																					
595	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways, first is that it is very hot in the desert. Second is that there aren�t many towns out there. Finally is that water is hard to find out there, so if he get thirsty it would be hard to get more water if you didn�t find a town.	1	1		1																					
596	3	The setting affects the cyclist in almost everything he does and everything he faces. The setting is a hot day in June in the dessert. There are many hills and the terrain changes a few times. Because the day is hot the cyclist drinks lots of water. And because he drinks lots of water he very soon runs out. In the story it states, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June. This quote shows that because it was so hot, the cyclist drank lots of water and because he drank lots of water he very quickly run out of water. Also in the story it states, �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� This quote suggests that becaused the terrain changed to hills, the cyclist became very tired and hot from having to pedal up and down those hills. And because this caused him become hot and tired he also drank his water more quickly than if he was pedaling on a flat paved road in a cool day in @DATE1. In conclusion the setting causes the cyclist to become tired, hot, and thirsty, which affects his entire journey.	3	2		3																					
597	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren�t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat.	2	2		2																					
598	3	"The features of the setting have a large affect on the cyclist. If a cyclist would happen to be cycling in the snow, he or she could eat snow do keep from dehydration. If the cyclist in,�Do Not Exceed Posted  Speed Limit"", was cycling in winter time, he would of been so thirsty all of the time. Also if the whole ride was down hill, he would be so tired,"	1	1		1																					
599	3	The conditions for the cyclist in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� are pretty dangerous. �a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement balance my dehydrated state bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips� (kurmaskie, @NUM1). There was a rather large snake in his path. You can tell he isn�t an expert on snakes because he couldn�t identify it. Because he is in the desert on a long bike ride, he is dehydrated. His water supply is almost gone. The cyclist feared many dangerous challenges in his journey.	3	2		3																					
600	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self- determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths inorder to reach their destination.For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are based to reach some rough spots where it seems you can�t walk. But that is where self�determination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there @MONTH1 be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip, when you don�t have the right provision to keep you self energised you can �t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything.This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
601	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the terrain has a negative effect on the author. He claims that �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie). This shows that he has been drinking his water too fast due to the heat from being in the desert at summertime. After travelling from a long time with no water he lets out a chuckles thinking of how he shouldn�t have taken the old mens advise. He explains that �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but atleast I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� This is an example of how badly the terrain had effected him. Its gotten to him so much that he applauds himself for having the energy to feel sorry for himself.	2	2		2																					
602	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist is tired and thirsty already. The features include a desert like setting of California, it is extremely hot, there are no signs of civilization in sight, and the roads are like hills that always were throughout the desert. On top of those facts the cyclist is dehydrating because his water suposely has diminished. 	1	1		1																					
603	3	"The setting of the short cut affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, he said there was rusty water, and ""it tasted like battery acid"" because of this he was not able to drink it which made him become dehydrated. Also in the story is says, ""flat roads were replaced by short rolling hills."" This could of made the journey even harder for the cyclist because now he had a little more effort to get up the hills one more example is towards the end he says ""i began breaking my ride down into distances, i could see the horizon telling myself i could make it there."" By the cyclist saying this it seems like he has given up and he realizes that this journey is going to never end untill he dies. That is how the setting on the story affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
604	3	Some features of the setting affected the cyclist. The rolling hills, poisonous snake, and the conditions of the road worried her. For example, @CAPS1 said, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and the diary.� @CAPS1 had high doubt when saying that quote. @CAPS1 didn't think @CAPS1 would ever make it. Finally, @CAPS1 reached another destination and again finding herself asking another older man for directions!	2	2		2																					
605	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The first major example is when the cyclist finds that the flat road is turning into �short, rolling hills,� These hills are increasing the difficulty and are causing him doubt that he will make it. An additional part of the setting which caused major doubt was that he was in a deserted desert. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The horizon was what kept cyclist going. �I began breaking the ride down into distarres: I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine.� The horizon kept him hopeful and determined. Without the setting he would not have been in such a serious but luckily in the end the setting helped him be determined enough to make it.	3	2		3																					
606	3	I guess really sofcty comes first, and you have to be cautious when yay out in the streets on a bicycle. I really don�t understand much, so I can�t write much.	0	0		0																					
607	3	When the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence. He biked to the first town but it was like a �ghost town.� A town is a town. soon after that, he did not see anything. No cars, buildings, or anything. He was getting sad and dehydrated. The old men swore there was a town coming up so he put his trust and confidence in him once again. He saw a building  coming up, but it was just an old wore down factory. He thought he was let down. He was sure he was going to die, right there right now. He than saw a siga for a fish comp! He was overjoyed! The place was real to! He thought of them as his savior! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously.	1	2		2																					
608	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie there were many settings that affect the cyclist. One example would be when he came up to a water pump and he tried to get water out but water didn�t come out. ��working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out�.� (Kurmaskie). Another example is when he came across rolling hills, and the scaring heat, he also came across a snake that took up most of the pavement.	1	1		1																					
609	3	The feautures of the settings affect the cyclist if it is just between buildings and cars the cyclist won't be able to break free and bicycle freely. So it can affect him.	0	0		0																					
610	3	The setting in the story was hot. The biker was sweating a lot. The whole town was empty. He pasted empty buildings. Their were rivers and big hills that he had to ride through. As it says about the buildings, �somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� The setting would affect the cyclist because their was no one in the town. Also, their was high hills.	1	1		1																					
611	3	The feature of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. He was a California desert in the month of June. There was no water in the desert so he had to use the water he had. He says the sun began taking harder ran and the terrain turned into short rolling hills. The hills made him work harder which dehydrate him guccher.and since there was no water in the desert, he could have died of dehydration	2	2		2																					
612	3	When your with your family in ocean city biking down the board walk your only obstacle is people. When your in a race on whinedy roads you could have lots of obstacles. The wheather could be your greatest obstacle. You could pass out by lack of water and scorcing heat. You could fall over by slippery roads from the rain. Along with that nature could lay its toll apon you. �a ridiculously large snake�blocked the majority of the pavement in front of @NUM1, Kurmaskie) @CAPS1 like a snake you don�t know what you could come across.	1	1		1																					
613	3	Many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist is biking through deserts. �A rediculously large snake� this quote shows that only is weather and climate agasint him but also nature.� I could drop from heat stroke� another great quote showing how hot it really is where the cyclist is.� There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� A great detailed desciption of where the cyclist is and how deserted the area is.� The bottle only contained a few  tantilising sips.� This cyclist is low on water in the desert and in the desert with no water that could be a very bad thing. The above quotes really draw you in and you get to see the many features of the setting and what its like for the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
614	3	The features of the setting in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� Affect the cyclist in many ways. First in the essay when the @CAPS1 says he is in the deserts of California, that can affect because it gives them an idea of how hot it most likely was out there and how lack of water can really harm someone. Also when the @CAPS1 describes the water pumps and what comes out o them, it can give the cyclist a feeling of disgust and remind them to always keep a good water supply.	2	2		2																					
615	3	"Many things in the setting of the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affected the cyclist throughout his journey. One very important part that affected the cyclist greatly is the fact that he was in a deserts without a good supply of water. Another part of the setting that challenged the cyclist was the length of his journey. Those two factors of his journey to Yosemite combined are probably the worst and most challenging things that affected the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
616	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because. It was a lack of the water and he was in the high deserts or California .For example in the text stated �when I tried a drop or two, it  had the flovor of battery acid. That showed clearly when he tried to get water from a pump what it clearly came out as the settling was extremely hot and made the cyclist misreable in such ways.	1	1		1																					
617	3	In the story the features of setting affect the cyclist because there is not much he can depend on. For example, it is the desert and usually there is nothing there. The cyclist only has a limited supply of what he needs and riding through there does not help him. For example, the old men who gave him directions made him think he could make it longer before he could elgo. This affected him because throughout his journey his lack of water slowed him down and made him think he wasn`t going to make it. When he finally got to �Gary & Wilber�s fish camp,� he learned a lesson because when an old man asked if he know the quickest route to Yosemite he said yes, I have a very good map.''	2	2		2																					
618	3	In many real-life situations, nature or a setting can be the biggest hindrance in succeeding, or even surviving. For example, the cyclist with stood the blozing heat of the sun as he pedaled through what seemed to be the @CAPS1�s living room: Dry, desolate, and extremely scornful. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� @CAPS2 and depicts the intense heats of the desert. Another feature in the setting was the every hanging hills and steps though pedaling down the hills was an easier task, traveling up the hill, as well  as maneuvering the thirsts and bends served as a direct conflict. An example, �with what I believed was my last burst of energy I maneuvered a setting affect a situation is ultimately, the cyclist reached his destination is great relief. But the biggest hindrance was along his setting.                        	3	3		3																					
619	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they made the simplist challenges for him. The back of water and the snake in his path are examples.	1	1		1																					
620	3	First, by accepting the old mens� advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would, easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a �ghost town�, lifeless and most importantly, waterless. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like �battery acid�. Next he rides past a �Rough Road Ahead� sign; not the most encouraging thing on his journey. To add to the despair, he has to manever his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp. �To him, this simple bait shop was like  beacon of hope from food himself.	2	3		3																					
621	3	In this story, the cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite, California. In the begining, the cyclist was sure of himself he decided to ask some old men that looked like they haven't been off their porch since Carter was in office for directions. The old men ended up leading him into the middle of the desert. In the desert, the sun was beating down on him and he had a limited supply of water. There was no sign of civilization what so ever. These hot conditions made the cyclist very hot, tired, and very thirsty. But that didn't stop him, he kept going and eventually he came apon a little town where he could drink cool water and take a well needed rest. 	2	3		3																					
622	3	Through most the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way. For instance, he makes it to this town a guy swore was there, but it turned out to be abandoned. So he let out a sad, hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, so he hung his head and that blues tune �summer time� rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst. So he stuck some pepples in his mouth to take his mind off it. Then he thought about how lucky he�d be if he checked, @CAPS1 negative to me.	2	2		2																					
623	3	The features from the essay affect the cyclist in many was because he is getting field, and is drinking more and more water. The raods are getting rough so he needs to slow down. If he slows down he will get tierd and need more water although he is all out on top of that the old men really didnt know what they were talking about the features affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
624	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways, for example, the heat was unberable beating down on him during this long ride. The fact that he had no where around him to fill up his water bottle. So he was deing of thirst and he didn�t know where he was going or how far he had to go. The setting was crushal in this story.	1	1		1																					
625	3	The setting in the begining of the story is flat an easy but as the path becomes unfamiliar it turns into many hills & turns. This effects the cyclist a lot because he was low on water & was begining to become dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
626	3	The setting affects the cyclist. He starts to see things that will affect his mind. Passing there is rolling around him he starts to feel abandoned and misled because there are no signs is going to right way.	1	1		1																					
627	3	The cyclist has to over come a lot of obstacles. For example, there is a snake in his path, so he cationly rides around it. Also, there are alot of hills and he wasn�t sure if he could make it up those hills. Furthermore, he is almost out of water so he could die of heatstroke or dehidration. In conclusion he over comes these obsticles and achieves his goal. 	2	1		2																					
628	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the author goes through many seneries. All of the places that the author goes to make him even more determined because he wants to find water and he just wants to get to Yosemite. The determination pushes him to keep going further and further. And then the determination finally pays off after he goes around a turn because he then see�s a place where he can get something to drink and a place to cool down.	2	1		2																					
629	3	The features of this setting effect the author while he is cycling. They changed his hope to doubt. There were no buildings or cars, which led him to believe he would never get to Yosemite. Also, it had a rough terrain that made him doubt that he would ever get water. Im sure if the setting had buildings, people, even just civilization, then the cyclist would of been fine.	1	2		2																					
630	3	Blazing tempitures, lack of water, dwinding hope-all are the parts of the setting that affect the cyclist. Blazing tempitures, because the hotter the water was the more perspiration and lack of hydration was appointment you can�t put anything back in your skin and your body can�t function without water finally dwinding . Hope, the cyclist didn�t think he was going to live through this. He tried hard and pushed himself and success was made. He lived.	2	2		2																					
631	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he get tiring. The character, in the story is ridding his bike for a long period of time and he gets tired. He rides alone with nothing or none around his accept the tries and wild animals.	1	1		1																					
632	3	The features of the cyclist is rough because of the hills, snakes, heat, amount of water. The hills give you a breeze going down but going up give you a hard time. The snakes can hurt you by bitting. The heat could make you sick. The amount of water can really hurt you by being dehydrated.	1	1		1																					
633	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. The features of the setting affect the cyclist through the posted speed. Due to how the setting is the cyclist have a rough hill with wish.	1	1		1																					
634	3	The hills and bumpy road slow him down, and he is dehydrated. That is also slowing him down because he needs water. There are obsticles in the road too, such as, the big snake laying across the middle of the road. He is lost without water and could possibly die of an heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
635	3	Knew what he was getting himself into so if he needed water or nething like that, it was probly his own falt he should have brought some with him.	1	1		1																					
636	3	The cyclist and his journey in Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit were impacted by the setting. The �deserts of California in June� caused him to be weary very easily. The terrain change from the flat road to hills made him feel less confident because he felt the road sign was taunting him by saying DO NOT Exceed 55 mph. He could only go @NUM1. Finally, the large snake created an obstacle for him by blocking the majority of pavement in front of the cyclist. All of these features affected the cyclist in some way.	3	2		3																					
637	3	The story is basically talking about more people with cars should ride bicycles to work or to school�s so it want be alot of polution in the air.	0	0		0																					
638	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The temperature in the area affect the way he drinks his water which leads him to thinking he is going to die because he is running out of water. The �towns� he comes to are so deserted he thinks he is going in the wrong direction. All the settings in the story also help him not to give up but keep on going. In conclusion even though he had to go through all that doubt he was going to be alive in the end he still went on and tried. In the end he did make it and all it was worth it.	2	2		2																					
639	3	There are many setting that affect the cyclist. One feature would be the terrain around him. Also, the obstacles faced by the cyclist. Another feature would be the types of wild animals & scarceness of water around . Also, the old man who gave him unimportant & non-updated information. All of these would affect the cyclist because it would  wear & fear on his physical & mental strengths.	2	1		2																					
640	3	I think that there were many things contributing to the cyclists state at the end of the story. First, there was the fact of time. He was cycling in June which is very hot due to it is summer. Second, he was cycling through California which is warm even in early @DATE1. And third he was traveling through the deserts. So if you put all of that together. He was cycling on a hot June day in the deserts of California. These @NUM1 things all contributed to the characters state. He went through dead towns in his search for water and found an old well pump with extremely hot water, that tasted like battery acid. He drank to much water at the begining which left him with just spit toward the end. He was lucky to find a fish camp in the middle of nowhere and to have found water. The three things made him drink too much water at first and barely left him with enough.	3	2		3																					
641	3	The features affects the setting of the cyclist because in some ways they through you off a little with others lines and then will get confused of what their acually talking about. The littlest thing that could through you off is the line when it says before the last world war. That kind off through me off alittle.	1	1		1																					
642	3	"The setting that were affecting the cyclist was the lack of water he had because it says �the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,"" and the text also says "" I�ld read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing the spit to circulate� he wouldn�t be trying to get his mind off of thirst if he wasn�t thirsty."	1	1		1																					
643	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it was June and the cyclist had little water. The cyclist was dehydrated and couldn�t find any building or water for many miles. The cyclist took advice from oldtimers which didn�t know what they were talking about. In conclusion, the weather and the location affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
644	3	The cyclist pedaled through all types of different terrain. Through   hills, high desert, flat roads and the woods. This cyclist took the advice of bunch old men who thought they knew a short cut to the Yosemite national park. This short cut turned out to be a nightmare. The cyclist had only brought so many water bottles and was quickly drinking them all. The setting of this story changed a lot making the cyclist at   times have to pedal faster and slowes. The cyclist was quickly worn out and started to loose hope in himself. The  terrain kept changing making it  hard for him not to be thirsty. Eventually he drank all of his water and knew he would die of dehydration or a heat stroke. As he came up over a long hill he saw a bait store and stopped inside to have a drink vowed not to listen to a bunch of old guys again.	2	2		2																					
645	3	"The features of the setting make him happy because he meets some people that tell him of a route that will take a lot of time off his trip. This is what the text says, �what I shouldn�t have done was let them have a peck at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a �shortcut� that was to slice away hours from my ride."" He also talks about not talking directions from old timers. This is when the text says,�"	1	1		1																					
646	3	During the cyclist journey to Yosemite many things got in his way and slowed him down. For example, he listened to the old men who gave him wrong directions to where he wanted to go. Also, his water supply was getting low which drained his energy alot quicker than usual. The heat also played a part of his energy loss. The heat made him sweat perfusely which made the water that was in his body be of no use.    	2	1		2																					
647	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, he was in the california desert in June.The heat and lack of water can cause people to become dehydrated,passout or even die.There are not many sources of water in the deserts.The terrain didn�t help him much either, hills use a lot of energy and  made him perspore,causing him to lose flood from his body. The cyclist was greatly affected by the features of the setting.	2	2		2																					
648	3	The rider in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie has a very analyzing mind, which is affected by things around him. At first, the rider �rode into the morning...with a smile� because of the bright sun, and the �cool pines� and rushing rivers�...he is very confident with the old mens directions, this first sign of disapointment is when he comes to the �ramshackle shed...� And the �...sight of this was troubling...� to him, but he rode on. He thinks as he rides over the �crippling hills� that maybe this wasn�t such a great idea. Finally he comes to a old bait shop, and the �modern bathroom� that he enters to drink from, gives him relief from the desert he had just been riding through.	2	2		2																					
649	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. The landscape was hard to ride on, there was intense heat & little water. As a result, it was a long trip and he had a difficult time reaching his destination.	1	1		1																					
650	3	At first the trip was easy going and flat. It was a nice day out and the water sapply was draining. Soon, the path became hills and soon got rough. Even though the pines gave shade it wasn�t enough to help the cyclist. Eventually he reached some what civilization after enduring a grueling climb and by cycle trip through the woods.	1	1		1																					
651	3	"The essay on ""Rough Road Ahead"" is about the dangers of speed and assault. It�s just letting you know to follow instructions and read signs. You should always keep close @NUM1/= out for signs and things.  "	1	1		1																					
652	3	Setting that affected the cyclist was water tempeter, rolling hills and condition of the roads. Water was a factor because he need cool water to keep him hydrated he came to a shed with pumps after running out of water. He started pumping the water it was hot but he took it he tried to let it cool down but it didn�t. Rolling hills was another a tender to the cyclist hardships because the road started off flat then ended up in hills going up his can strain the leg and makes it harder to keep riding. Another hardship was road condition, it was smooth at frist then it became rough and rocky. Those was some affects the cyclist had to over come	2	2		2																					
653	3	Setting  depends on how you can go or move. The town hills helped the cyclist. The up hills didn�t. The cyclist  got a bad idea or aditude when he saw the towns he was upset and mad he didn�t want to die and yet he though. He was going two. He said he wouldn�t trust old men anymore. They didn�t know where were talking about .How and why did he trust even in the first place.	2	2		2																					
654	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways.For example, ""I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This quote shows that his surroundings were giving him diffuculty and a challenge for his travel. By describing the hills as ""rolling"" it helps the reader imagine the obstacles he was going through. Also, the sign that read, ""Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" gives the reader a feeling that the character is in danger. Lastly an example of the setting that helps shows the charcters hardships is, ""no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any hand."" If anything were to the happen to the character, as the author was foreshadowing, he'd be stranded and all alone to die. He'd be in trouble and there would be no one to help him. If the author did not use these examples, the reader would not easily get a picture of the troubles he had to overcome. In conclusion these examples added emphasise and meaning to the text.

655	3	Well the features of the setting affects the cyclist is a lot of ways. Well when his water was is hot to drink He got some pebbles and stuck them, in his mouth. He had heard somewhere that if you do that it will dilute your spit. The terrain of the story was very rocky and hilly. Those are the features of the terrain.	1	1		1																					
656	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The hills afected the cyclist because they would be harder for him to ride The abandoned town also affected him. When he got to the town he was hoping he could get more water and take a break but when he got there the town was abandoned. Also the highway was hard for him because it would be hard for him to ride on. Also there was nowhere that he could get water around him. Many features of the setting affected him.	2	2		2																					
657	3	The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist�s anger. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, �one ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule.� All of sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to becom frightened and neurotic. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, �the water wouldn�t cool down� and �it had the flavor of battery acid. The cyclist�s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought �had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory.� The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting.  	3	2		3																					
658	3	The features in the setting most definetly affect the cyclist while he travels. The cyclist is incredibly thirsty and tired and the setting he�s placed in just gives him no hope of survival really. He first comes to a �ghost town� where he finds no one is living. This first encounter with isolation in a desolute place doesn�t really affect him because it is the first place he finds but the rest of the storys setting comes to mimic this. As he travels he is met with barren land, no water and no people in sight. It�s June in California and the cyclist fears he @MONTH1 soon suffer from heat stroke if he doesn�t find water yet. It doesn�t help when he comes to an abandoned juice factory that taunts him with the one thing he needs to survive. All in all the features in the setting make the cyclist lose hope, make him feel like he will die if he dosen�t find water.	2	3		3																					
659	3	The setting in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was based in the hot, and dry terrain of California. This setting affected the character mood. It did this because some of its included feature can seem as actual metaphorically based moods. An example from the story is, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite...� this quote from the story could suggest the tone and the mood of the scenery which would be calm, and relaxed. So from the scene that is being seen and the mood it has would also give the character its mood.	2	2		2																					
660	3	The features of the setting that affect cyclist depends where they are located. In this story the feeling on �nothing and the desert around him and the heat gave him no hope�. It all depends on where you are cycling. �It didn�t really matter I was going to die.� This quote states his feelings on what was going on through his head while he was dieing of thirst. He felt nothing he was sure he was going to die until he found a sign of civilization that was near and he became better and his hope was raised.	2	2		2																					
661	3	I think the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It being a long, hot, lonely ride there, had an effect on him. It scared him which made him go longer. He had nothing to drink and thought he was going to die it made him weak. The snake in the way caused him longer and every stop that had once there effected him to.	1	1		1																					
662	3	I would think even riding a bike for so long can be bad for the behind. But also good exercising especially for the legs all the strength you get from the muscle. To know where you going could take forever. But I do know what they would have to face all types of weather, but as long as you have gear on no harm could come to you.	1	1		1																					
663	3	At first he was mad because he took advise from old men who never left their porch. He got scared he was going to die because had he drunk all his water and he didn�t know how long it would be till he got some more. He shouldn�t have drank his water so quickly knowing he had a while to go. Then he became happy when he saw the bait sign. He biked quickly down the hill.  	1	1		1																					
664	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, in many ways. The cyclist is affected because the setting is depressing and frightening. When the cyclist first sees the speed limit sign of 55 mph, he says, �Sometimes life can be so cruel�. Because he can only go 12 mph considering he's on a bike. After seeing the sign, a snake crosses his path. He�s frightened by it because it looked like a diamond back and he was trying to keep his balance and ease past it. Since the main problem the cyclist is faced with is the lack of water, the dry, long hills seem to make him more weak and tired. Tumble weeds crossed past him and there was no water in sight That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
665	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It made him become dehydrated. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 sentence @NUM2 he stated �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� This shows how the heat and climate of the setting affected him by how he was getting thrown off balance and wears     to him getting dehydrated. The setting of the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, effects the cyclist in the story.	1	1		1																					
666	3	The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist. It is an extremely hot now in California while the narrator in aiding his ride. This causes him to become delighted much faster while he is on a �Short hit� leading to no where. �Wide signs of dried outcast winded my limb, and the growing realization that I could drop from ?? a gorgeous day in June� This gust shows how that calm day really was and the fact the cyclist is sweating so much shows how much the weather is affecting him. The rolling hills in the story also affect the cyclist. By cycling towards up and down no often, it secured his journey. It cowed him to the side even longer in getting to a town with water.The deserted knowns in the setting are negatively also affected the narrator. It gave him a hopeless narration because there was no place to stop and depleting his water supply.	2	3		3																					
667	3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal. Before you bike thinkof what conditions are ahead of you	3	2		3																					
668	3	because he was telling to make it wirte he nite to go and he much it because he was drieing to soil and because he was drieing 55 mph pert hour and 12 mph and sometime life can feel so cruel in life ya dig and that ia all I can said right now.	1	1		1																					
669	3	Each time the author comes to a point where the setting isn�t very appealing or helpful, he loses hope for reaching his destination or finding a nice place to rest and get some fresh water. For example, the text states, �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The author has a sort of negative, sarcastic tone at this point. This shows that he�s getting frustrated and losing some hope. He also mentions that the �sight was troubling� which shows how big of an affect the features around him or scenery can have.	2	2		2																					
670	3	Lots of features in the setting play an affect on cyclist. Some that @MONTH1 play an affect are the heat, flat road that�s had to ride on, or how there	1	1		1																					
671	3	This essay is an american tale that express how hard it is to do someing. But do it thought determination. The cycle are faced with many change not onnly physically but also menataly. There was no one in sight not a building  or anything. As this rider come to think that the sabstatal beating he took from the ride he is tirde and no sight of baidi say he might not be able to do it.	1	1		1																					
672	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. First of all he is travelling through a desert in California in June so the weather is extremely hot and the cyclist needs water, however as he is running out of the water he brought along with himself, he cannot find any other water himself so he is thirsty and almost dehydrated. Also, if frustrates him that when he finds water, not only is it hot it tastes like battery acid @CAPS1, when the cyclist decides to conserve some of his water and go to the next town to get more water, but there is another setback. The condition of the road is so poor, that the cyclist cannot go more that 12 mph. Thus, if he ever reaches the next town. he still will have to wait longer for the much needed water, travelling at 12 mph. The snake is also another setback that the cyclist was fortunately able to escape. Thus his major concern is the lack of water.	3	3		3																					
673	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. At first it was a bright shiny day and the cyclist was happy. He reaches the first town which is a ghost town and it makes him sad. Riding on he begins to lose water. The once bright shiny day began to beat the heat down on the cyclist. He reached a ramshackle shed and began to lose hope. He loses water quickly and becomes more dehydrated. The terrain become slopes and hills and the ride become harder, when he reached the grape drink factory his hopes were almost gone. But just over the hill was a fishing shop. He used his reining energy to speed down the hill to get water and get his energy back. 	1	1		1																					
674	3	"The features of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when it says, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.� The features of this setting are making the cyclist determined. Another example, is when it says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" The features of the setting are making him brave and couragious. The last example is when it says, �I hung my head.� The features of this setting are making the cyclist have despair. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
675	3	In the essay �Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit,� the cyclist is affect both positivly and negativly by the setting. Setting is the sounding in which the story tacks place. In the story a cyclist loses his way and band is put in to dangous because of it. The setting of the story can be dicrided as mountainous with many rolling hills. The author discride the setting by say �@CAPS1 two miles in to the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.� The change in terrain made it more difical for the cyclist. However he also used the land to give him hope that he was almost their. He told him self that he�d make it if he make it over the next hill. The setting of the story gave the cyclist hope and problems in his journy to sarive.	1	1		1																					
676	3	The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men who�s information was not accurate. Then he cycled along the desert which was very hot. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way. He almost had a heat stroke a few times. He was probably angry that he took these men�s advice and got himself into this. Then when he found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So it�s really confusing because he probably felt relived and mad at the same time. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn�t, the old man would have gave him some more messed up direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke.	3	2		3																					
677	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by rush he /she got when speeding down the hill. The fresh morning air, no limits just you and your feet. Speeding, going as fast as you can with your heart pounding in your chest. No boundarys, when you can go where you like, when you like. No people to get in the way of you and your need for speed.	0	0		0

In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike. Being unware of where he is on his journey the setting begins to really affect him. For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that ""The sight was troubling."" As he continues to California in June the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. For example he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" The quote shows because he is biking so long is looking water and there is not a town is sight he becomes weak and although he is at terminated to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in. "	3	3		3																					
679	3	�@CAPS1 directions, June, lack of water� all are elements that effect the rider on his ride. He took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut. I turned out that their short cut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California. It would have been burning hot. Lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip. He could have died if he didn�t find the other water source. These were some elements that effected the rider on his trip.	2	2		2

681	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed Limit,� is about a man that follows some bad directions and in the middle of a desert is stuck without water. He starts to lack confidence in the directions when the setting changes. He said, �After fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first town it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.� He had been told this was a thriving town but was left with nothing. This was a big let down and the cyclist wasn�t so positive this had been the right choice. He keeps on riding and finds another dissetling sight.� One ramshacle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that wouldn�t  hold in the lamest of mule greeted me.� @CAPS1 was another place said to be good but all he got was battery flavored water. On the last strech of his bike met with rough rolling hills, a diamondback looking snake, and an abandoned juice factory. All of this brang his spirits lower and lower until he thought he would die. The cyclist ended up finding a store but he was discauraged by the environment he was in a hot and could have died.	1	1		1																					
682	3	In the essay, the cyclist is greatly affected by the features of the setting. Under the conditions he could barely survive and make it to his destination. It is clear that the features of the setting are affecting him when he states,�The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cruel.� In his efforts he is slowly getting weaker and the sign he sees only makes him feel worse because it seems to him that it mocking him. He also states, �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate. With any luck I�d hit a bump and ledge one in my throat.� This shows he is ready to give up completely and wouldn�t care if he died. From the author�s tone, it is clear that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
683	3	Features of the setting such as the hot sun, no water, and �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp,� greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high desserts of California in June, the temperature was really high and the hot sun left �wide rings of dried sweat� on his shirt and made the cyclist realize that he could drop from a heatstroke. Also, the fact that the only water around felt �somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees� and �had the flavor of battery acid� prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a �dehydrated state.� @CAPS1, �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp� affected the cyclist by solving his problem of dehydration, since there was cold water availible for him upon arrival.	2	2		2																					
684	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all, if the cyclist didn�t listen to the old man, he would have never gone through this trouble. Also being that he didn�t have enough water when he went on riding, caused him to be real dehydrated. He should of turned back as soon as he ran out of water. Plus the heat made him real hot and thirsty. He should know how to never trust any strangers and try things on his own.	1	2		2																					
685	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist .The setting makes him feel thirsty, dry, hot, and lost. In the story the setting plays a big party in the cyclist's will to ride to the next town. First the cyclist asks directions from a guy that never left his house in decades this creates, doubt. Also in the story it says �Tumbleweeds cross my path� this makes the cyclists feel lost. Finally it say the �water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This makes the cyclist thirsty and tired. The features definatly have an effect on the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
686	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist is affected by the setting in many different ways. He was biking in the middle of the summer in a very hot state of California. This affects him because he is sweating and he is running out of water and he could possibly become dehydrated. The roads are very hilly so, he has to use alot more energy to get up the hills. That�s why I think the cyclist is extremely affected by the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed.�   	2	1		2																					
687	3	The cyclist had to deal with some tough terrain throughout his ride. First, he was in the �high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 usually brings a picture to my mind of a very dry, hot place. The cyclist had trouble finding water he needed, and thought he might die of heatstroke in the conditions. Also, there were hills. The cyclist said he had to ride over �one long, crippling hill.� From my experiences as a cyclist, hills are the worst part, especially if you�re thirsty. The climate in this story was very hot and dry, and the terrain was full of hills, so altogether, that would make one bad bike ride.	2	2		2																					
688	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuious setting to have to bike with. I would never be able to do what he did.	1	1		1																					
689	3	The cyclist had alot of problems with his setting. It was very hot and he started getting low on water. This caused him to become dehydrated. There was hardly any civilization so no one could come to his aid. Also, the path he decided to take was long and vigorous.	1	1		1																					
690	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, written by Joe Kurmaskie, the author describes the setting as hot, tiresome, and aqusting.

The bikerider describes his as the high desserts of California in June, being hot and musky, ruff terrain, etc. This gives you an image of what the bike rider feels physically and emotionally. This image shows how tired, thirsty, and determined the bikerider really is. Using words, metaphors, and imagery the author puts you in the shoes of the bikerider emotionally and physically.	3	0		3

693	3	Varias faetures of the setting affect the journey and mooble if the cyclist in the text. The first feature of the setting that affect the cyclist is the desert. He is �traveling through the high deserts of California in June� , and this is making him really thirsty. �[He] had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly �because of this. He later runs out of water, and becomes hopeless. He becomes hopelee because there is no building or establishments anywere in sight. Therefore no water and there isn�t a place to get any water.

696	3	"In �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist by making him doubtfull. The cyclist is doubtfull that he won�t make it to Yosemite National Park. ""It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the bivas would pick me clean, leaving only some expenses outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom and their keen senses of direction.� This shows how he is doubtful. Finally in the story the cyclist doesn�t think that they will make it."	2	2		2																					
697	3	In the passage, the features of the setting affect the cyclist because every time he comes along something different a new idea about his survival comes into his head. First, when the cyclist sees the mule he says, �This sight was troubling,� he is now troubled by the fact that he had not seen a town yet and starting to doubt the old mens advise. Also, when he sees the juice factory he puts some pebbles in his mouth and says, �It didn�t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This shows that seeing the broken down juice factory gave him no hope and he tells his self that he will die.	2	2		2																					
698	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting had a major impact on the character. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park, but on the way, he had some troubles, the fact that there was not much civilization affected the cyclist because he was not able to refill his water bottles, so he grew very thirsty. Also, the many hills and the fact that it is summer impacted him greatly because he became tired out more easily and could not pedal as fast. When it says, �A tar like substance oozed out Wouldn�t cool down,� it showed how he wasn�t able to drink. Also, when he passed the grape juice factory, it must have been torture to him since he was so thirsty. If he hadn�t taken the advice of the men in the first place he would have had a much shorter ride and would not have been so exhausted. The setting affected the cyclist a lot in this essay.	3	3		3																					
699	3	The cyclist is beginning at what seems a fine idea and place. Then the conditions become hot, dreadful, and maybe sticky. The constant heat without any breeze was getting to the character. Mirages appeared, or so he thought. He actually thought he might die. Not quite an optimistic one is he? � It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�� The heat must have been bad, he wasn�t thinking straight and was slowly checking himself into a mental center! Although painful heat was a brilliant way to learn a lesson in cycling, and the old men �helping� with directions.	2	2		2																					
700	3	As he began his journey, he had full confidence in the directions given given to him by the old men. After he came to the first town and there was no water, he rode on. After he found an �ramshackle shed� he became troubled , as he �had been �hitting� his �water bottles regularly� and was traveling through the �desert of California in June� and was running low on water. Coming to a place where he saw a building over hills, he �manuevered� his way down, only to find it long  deserted and himself close to despair. He was desparate for water he needed it soon. Finally, he came upon �@CAPS1 and Wilber�s Fish Camp� and quenched his thirst, and was relieved. Then on  he wised up, and took no more directions from old men who knew little to nothing about cycling.	2	2		2																					
701	3	The features of the setting in the story �DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, affect the cyclist in the story, in many ways. The first of which would definetly be the lack of water the cyclist had, and the fact that there wasn�t anywhere around for miles. From the text it read �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� This evidence from the text proves to the reader that the cyclist was getting worried. Another part of the setting would be the obvious element of temperature. The cyclist is our in the hot, relentless desert. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The author here, by using the elements of nature, is trying to make the reader concerned/scared for the main character. The final key had to travel and the road conditions. Although the desert is flat, he began to notice some hills in the road, and such a long distance, including the heat, could be deadly. The setting�s elements, greatly effect the cyclist in this story.	2	3		3																					
702	3	The cyclit of �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, was greatly affected by the setting of his bike ride, which caused him pain and displeasure. He travels in the high deserts of California in June, which he exaggerates that water there was �@NUM1 degers�. The great heat caused him to drink lots of water, depleting it much quicker than he would�ve wished. It also sopped the energy out of him, further complicating his ride. Along the way there is literally nothing there and he has nowhea  to replenish his water supply. The hilly, rough terrain also calls for hard, tough peddling, sopping even more energy. The heat, terrain, and lack of places to stop combined for an awful ride for the cyclist of this story.	2	2		2																					
703	3	"The lone biker in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� by @PERSON1 is strongly affected by the features of the landscape. The sun is the most important factor; it drives him to first consume his water quickly, and then drives him search for a water source.�The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it...I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly,� in this quote, it reveals that even though the biker had not acknowledged the sun, his body had required water, depleting his supply in his water bottles. A lack of water feeling two hundred degrees...it had the flavor of battery acid."" The only water that the bike is able to find is not consumable. The most important of the factors, in the matter of survival, is the fish camp that the biker finally reaches. �I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.� The biker had been on the brink of dehydration and the fish camp is where he finally reganed the strength to continue on his journey."	3	3		3																					
704	3	Dry, thirsty, tedious-all are features of setting that affect the cyclist. First, everything is dry. The cyclist isnt any where near a town that could help him. He has been pedaling in the heat, outside for a long time. Secondly, He is very thirsty. The way he is travelling is a good sign he is in need of water. He went fourty miles before he reached the first town to stop at. He also is on a bike, So that doesn�t leave him much room to carry water along. Lastly, the trip is tedious. He has been going for forty miles, and the speed limit is 55. He hasn�t acceded 12 mph. All to gether, the cyclists trip seems to be adventure that takes a lot of heart.	1	1		1																					
705	3	the setting affects the cyclist very strongly in the story because mentally and physically he wasn�t ready for where he was going. For example the text states �No a better, piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never. Accept traver advice from a collection of old timers who wasn�t left the cosines of theer poiches since calter was in office.� So a youg guy took maid advice from older guys about how to get to a pack backin thier day it probably was a shortcut.   	1	1		1																					
706	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was very hot and he didn�t have any more water also, there aren�t any towns that had good water in them, until he eventually arrived at this fishing comp. Due to his lack of water, he became dehydrated and really weak. �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill,� this quote shows that he was beginning to become dehydrated and losing his energy.	1	2		2																					
707	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.	2	3		3																					
708	3	The setting from the story left the cyclist in a mental way because most of the time the sun was on his mind due to the fact that he was pedaling hard in a hot summer day in June. The cyclist had very little water and with him biking under a beating sun wasn�t exactly helping him. He  had to like disasterous events like, peddling slopes than the normal speed, a snake blocking the path, old men telling to take a different route then be infected, and the fact that his water supply was low made him think he was going to pass out under the burning sun. However his determination was strong as he continued on pedaling through and he eventually found himself in another town but this time with people, fish and water.	2	2		2																					
709	3	From the setting that affected the cyclist are possible conditions such as the weather and surrounding enviorment like hills and streams or even tyes of animals and if they are poisenous or not. The setting has and can change the desision a cyclist makes.	1	1		1																					
710	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the hot sun makes the cyclist dehydrated and since there is no water sources around the cyclist is not getting any water. The rough terrain makes the cyclist tired.	1	1		1																					
711	3	Many features of the carlifonian desert influenced the cyclist during his ride.Ghost towns, rolling hills, and dangerous snakes influenced the cyclists experience during the''shortcut'' to yosenite.The Ghost towns along the journey syndized the world desrting him during his ride by offering no help with water supply as a place to cool dowdn.The road sign warning of rough terrain was another barrier on his bike ride that he had to get through in dehydration to reach his goal,yosenite.The diamondback rattlesnate caused additional horror to the cyclist's'' ride from hell''.He had to manuever around the serpent while unstable from dehydration.All features of the cyclist's riding setting affected his ride to yosenite.	3	2		3																					
712	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if it�s raining or snowing it affects the cyclist because pavement can be wet and icy. Which causes the cyclist to slip and @DATE1 and the cyclist can really get injured. Also the cyclist has to wear a helmet if it�s very hot outside you wouldn�t see the cyclist in winter clothes. This would make the cyclist unfocus and the cyclist wouldn�t be able to finish any race.	1	1		1																					
713	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can�t go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he�s relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn�t really know where he was going because there wasn�t a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first �town� as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and he�s only 12 he knows that he�s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
714	3	"The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affects the cyclist in many ways. First the setting does not look like what the cyclist has been told it lacks like. The cyclist had stopped to get directions from a group of older men who�s directions were out of date. Second the conditions of the road affects the cyclist. In the essay the cyclist explains that, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� A final feature of the setting that affected the cyclist was the temperature. The hot sun beamed down on the cyclist. As you can see, the features of the setting in ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affects the cyclist in many ways. "	2	2		2																					
715	3	The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he�s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he�s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that there�s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved.	3	3		3																					
716	3	The setting affected the cyclist by the people from Lodi get him into the wrong way and he had to survive from there so he that was very dry and No water or nothing to the next stop was at the bait store so he was determined to get to next stop destination by he did want to give up own but the guy ask him did he want direction he said he was not going to be fooled twice.	1	1		1																					
717	3	"It can�t be known as, ""easy"" to ride through a desert on a bike. Adding rough pavement, rusty water pumps, and not so friendly animals adds to the discomfort as well. The cyclist in this story encountered all these things, making his supposedly pleasurable ride turn to a semi brutal experience �it got down on my hands and knee, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. Alike substance ooed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees, �This quote shows how the conditions of his water supply where, which eventually lead him to dehydration. It lead: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT @CAPS1 SPEED LIMIT.�This quote also shows how the riding conditions were making the  cyclist have a harder time keeping speed. �at some point tumberweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-beaked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS2, this quote show of some of the dangers the  cyclist encountered. If  these features did not appear, then maybe the story would be describing a nice bike ride, but once you read about them, it becomes more of a disaster."	3	3		3																					
718	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It was so hot where he was that he kept drinking his water without realizing it until he only had a couple of sips left. The terrain also made him thirsty because the more he had to go up and down hills, the more he would drink. The fact that he did not see any town except on ghost town for miles affected him because he did not think he was going to make it to the next town. The setting played a major role on the cyclist because it affected him that much.	2	2		2																					
719	3	Setting plays a big role in this story. Without being in the desert in the hot @DATE1 there would not be a confict. There would be no importance in saving the water so he would not dehiderate. And the long flat roads are a symbol that the journey has still got a far way to go but as straight roads turn into hills it shows that there is a change in the journey and something better is about to happen.	2	2		2																					
720	3	"The setting affect is used to a great extent in the short story �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� The cycleist had beed going for a very long time when he came to the first town and there was no water At this point you can tell that he has lost confidence the �old timers"" directions. From this quote; �a ton-like substance oozed out.� This quote shows how after @NUM1 miles of pedaling when he was supposed to have come to two towns by that point his one chance of water had been depleated. The next time the setting affect is used is when he comes for a building that was rusted out. He said, �I hung my head� this shows how he almost completely lost all hope and that he was sure that he is going to die."	3	3		3																					
721	3	The cyclist is affected by @NUM1 couple different things. First, he is given directions that are out of date and then he has to deal with the heat of the weather in the early summer of California. If that wasn�t enough, he then runs out of water, which he needs very badly. He runs into a couple more problems, like seeing a big snake and coming to a factory that used to make juice and it was now run down and empty. After all of these obsticles, the cyclist pulls through and makes it to @NUM1 fishing store, where he gets water.	2	2		2																					
722	3	During the cyclist�s biking adventure he encounters several interesting situations. Each experience is in response to the setting in which it takes place. For example, this young man starts out confident with a bright hope of eventually reaching Yosemite National Park. The first spot he comes to is a ghost town This sight doesn�t immediately affect him, however it greatly adds on to the long term effects. He decides to continue on his treck reaching the next ghost from at this time he is becoming dehedrated due to his lack of water supply He decides to keep persueing his good and figures there must be water up ahead in the next town. In order to get the next town he must encounter some precarious situations including some changes in terrain. Eventually after reaching a source of running water he is overjoyed with happiness and relief. As evident in the provided text this man was effected by each feature of the setting. The different settings greatly affected his nature of confidence.	3	2		3																					
723	3	The setting effects the rider because if it�s hot you get thirsty and you have no water.This kind of question is hard to answer	1	1		1																					
724	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making the journey more dangerous and difficult. For example, in the reading it states that rediculously large, poisonous diamond back snakes. Blocked majority of the pavement. So, the cyclist had to keep his/her balance to ease past them. The terrian also changed into short, rolling hills, making it even more difficult. 	1	1		1																					
725	3	The features in the setting of the essay affect the author in one major way, dehydration. There are several features that causes the author to dehydrate. First off, he is riding throught a desert located in california. This means that there is bent from the sun constintly beating down on him. Also the change from �Flat read�, (Kurmaskie) to �short, rolling hills� (@CAPS1) also affected him, getting dehydrated. This change cased him to use more energy to climb up the hills which means he used more water because he got thrister faster. This is how the features in the setting affected the author of the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.�	2	2		2																					
726	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. For example, the tough terrain made it very difficult for the cyclist to reach his destination, Yosemite. He was already very fatigued but had to overcome hills. In the essay, he states, �I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. The setting features also affected the cyclist when he encountered the snake. He was dehydrated and could barely navigate around the dangerous snake. The cyclist explains, �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a riduculously large snake, it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased fast, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The setting also affected the cyclist because there was no one around him to help. The cyclist describes, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The cyclist was all alone and had to rely on himself to make it to Yosemite. In conclusion, the features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. He had to overcome ruggid terrain without energy, avoid a diamondback snake, and make it all the way to Yosemite because there was no one around. As you can see, the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
727	3	The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront  nature. when he began his trip with advice from �old coggers� he � rode out with strong legs and a smile.� As he came to the first town, he describes it as a �ghost town� having no water and no human contact for some time. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rods on. Through the miles he incountered a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps, snakes,and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his �inner spirit� and caused his dehydration to further. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation.	2	2		2																					
728	3	The harsh features at the setting affect the cyclist by hindering his journey to Yosemite National Park. As the cyclist is traveling along �The high deserts of California in June�, some problems arise. The heat from the pounding sun in the desert takes a toll on the cyclist causing him to drink more water and rapidly deplet his supply. The cyclist is also traveling through small �gost towns� rather than stoping at appropriate rest stops in order to refill with water and relax etc. Also while refilling he encounters hazards such as �Short rolling hills� through ghost the terrain and ever a snake. All of these features in the setting impare the cyclists ability to maintain confidence in wether he will make it to his destination and his positive attitude toward the journey etc.	2	3		3																					
729	3	Cycling is a very good sport people who do cycling are in shape. Also they have strong calve muscles. I think its also dangerous as well.	1	1		1																					
730	3	In the story the author says, �The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,� This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, �with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.� The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water.	2	2		2																					
731	3	The cyclist thought it was hard. Also he was upset that the old timers gave bad directions.	2	2		2																					
732	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First, he couldn�t get water from anywhere because he was in a dessert with nothing but ramshackle sheds and rusty camps. Second, there were short rolling hills, and rough roads which made it hard to ride on. There were tumbleweeds in his way and large poisons snakes. The heat made it hard to keep riding. And there were no buildings structures of people around to give him a lift or water. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
733	3	In this essay by Joe Kurmaskie, a young man is baited into accepting outdated information by a group of old men. He pays for it later when on his bicycle, he is almost killed by heatstroke or dehydration. The setting is an excellent way to portray his feelings of hopelessness, despair, and fatigue. While he is just starting out, the road is flat and easy. It is cool and breezy. When he begins to run out of water, the terrain becomes bumpier and harder. He sees empty plains, cracked, dry ground, and the hot sun. He begins to despair even more. After a while when he thinks he can go no more he sees a store that once held gallons of grape juice. He laughs at the irony. The setting does do a wonderful job of describing his sense of helplessness.	3	3		3																					
734	3	In this pasage the cyclist was affected by the setting because if it had been any were else he would not have suffered or learned at all. Because the seting had botha lack of civillesation and water that he needed that caused him to almost faint of thirst. This is an example of the setting affecting the cyclist, �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.� This showes that had all the setting been paridice he would never learned anything.	2	1		2																					
735	3	The features of the setting in the essay caused the cyclist to suffer and continue being determined. The author of the essay used phrases such as �the sun was beating down� and �high deserts of California in June� to emphasize the extreme heat that caused the cyclist extreme thirst and heat exhaustion. The essay also says �short rolling hills�, �tumbleweeds� and �long, crippling hill� to describe the difficult terrain the cyclist faced that caused him to be tired and slower.  Finally, the cyclist is faced with a �rediculously large snake� and plants and weeds which get in his way and force him to slow down.	2	2		2																					
736	3	The setting effects the cyclist very much. By the very dry climates	2	2		2																					
737	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead� plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn�t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see�s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn�t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. �Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.� @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her."	3	3		3																					
738	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it gives him the feeling of hopelessness. When the cyclist got directions to Yosemite from these two ??? old people, he thought he was getting a good shortcut. In reality, he was just led on a road that seemed to head nowhere where he saw many things that added to his feeling of hopelessness, for example, the author writes, � I toiled on. At some points, tumbleweeds crossed my path and an adversely large snake. It really did move like a diamondback blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This shows that the cyclist is getting tired and seeing tumbleweeds, which usually represents a phase being completely deserted and deadly snakes that get in his way. This answers the question because it shows how the setting leads to his feeling of hopelessness."	2	2		2																					
739	3	The story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was a rough undergoing story about a cyclist going though rough climate and terrain. In this story the description was like a scorching path of nothingness for about as far for human eyes could see. In paragraph @NUM1 the text says �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could die from heatstroke.� is empressed how the climate felt. This explains the heat and how he felt during this experience. This whole trip sounds suffering.	1	1		1																					
740	3	The features of a setting can affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, while he was riding in the hot sun he became very thirsty because whe only had a few drops of water left. That is how the setting can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
741	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. They make it hard to concentrate, because its heat, they make it unbearable. The setting has the affect of drowsiness and thirst, �Dry bitter lnad, longing, longing.	1	1		1																					
742	3	In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite. If the setting wouldn't have been so bad, the long ride wouldnt have been as hard on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a California desert, when he did find a well he said, � followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. � @CAPS1 thing about the setting is, if it wouldnt have been so hot, he wouldnt have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said �  I  could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. � In conclusion, the setting played a major role in the story.	2	1		2																					
743	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The man was riding a bike through rough lands. His adventure wouldn�t of been an adventure if he was just riding his bike an flat smooth element. The fact that the hills were steep, rocky and many hills is what made his bike ride what it was.	1	1		1																					
744	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is the old timers advice of how to get some were. Than the town they told go to was a ghost town. After he keep going the place that they told him to get water was very old and rusty and he pumped it he gaid tar came out. Than as he made his way in the dessert there way a snake came in the road he go around it. So never take advice from old timers.   	1	1		1																					
745	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist by showing the rough conditions he went through, and somehow perservered through. The author states numerous times the lack of water, and the rolling hills. Followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This shows the struggle he went through and supports the setting story and how it affected his trip. This also shows how he perserverd through his struggles and made an effort to finish.	1	1		1																					
746	3	The riders condition was rough, from flat land to rolling hills. This would be hard for some one who is dehydrating. There was a snake in his path so he went around it. This would be dangerous he could blackout from lack of water and then get bit by the snake.	1	1		1																					
747	3	The cyclist depicted in the essay is greatly effected by his surroundings. First, he described a beating sun and pines and rushing rivers. All these items are very animated things. The river is even described as rushing instead of, maybe violent. The setting is active just like the cyclist. Next, a ramshackle shed is acknowledged, as well as rusty pumps and a bad souding corral. When these old, forsaken things one mentioned, it can be noticed that the cyclist starts being a little in despair. And to tap that off, he drinks water that tastes like �battery acid.� Battery eats at skin just like the setting is eating at the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
748	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the setting is able to affect the cyclists emotions and moods in both positive and negative ways. As the author travels through the desert he is already upset because it is so hot and water is scarce showing how the terrain is a negative influence. Another example would be when the author first sees the old water pump and he is relieved showing positive influence but the pump oozes a shine like substance he referrs to as tasting like �battery acid� changing his mood for the worst. Finally, the pebbles he puts in his math show is desperation and willingness to try anything to survive show a new posotive outlook on the desert until a pump �lodges are in his thro at� making yet another negative influence. All of these feature lead him on his way to �Gary and will fish camp� and grounded an extra boost on his journey through the desert.	3	3		3																					
749	3	"The features of the setting affect him because it is hot and their is no where to go. An example from the test is when they said ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" There was also a part where he got to a sign that said ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.The speed limit was 55 mph. He was doing a water a water - depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. Thats what affected the cyclist the heart the hilly roads, no water, snakes, rough roads, and most all no directions."	2	1		2																					
750	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because where they were.It was like in te middle of nowhere and every person they asked are having all times.They go the wrong directions to the nearest town.The old guy told him it was @NUM1 miles down the road when he went @NUM2 miles to the next town and said to him self he will never take directions from a gut that has all timers and hasn�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
751	3	When the cyclist is in the �serenity of an early sunset evening�, the man enjoyed his cycling just hoping he could cut his time in half. Then, once he got the advice and headed down the road he saw a ghost town which is never good. Next he came to the fork and the town he came to had no water. On the way to the new town he came to the bumpy road and going @NUM1 he was out of water but finally after his determination he made it to a place that was very nice. So as you can tell the features of the scenery road affected him greatly.	2	2		2																					
752	3	I think that the setting made him find more courage inside him self to save his water and go to the next town with out any water.	1	1		1																					
753	3	The environment affected the cyclist violently in the story �do not exceed posted speed limit� It seems that all of the harsh conditions of cycling in California all worn down this kid who took some faulty directions from older people at one stop. The heat and lack of water supply made the boy dehydrated. It says in the essay �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a georgus day in June simply because I listend to some gentlemen.� this explains on how simply exhausted he had become due to the miles of cycling, and the beating down sun and total lack of water due to absence of all towns. He came to the point of almost dying from heat exhausgen because of the faulty directions of the old people. Next time, he better make sure to keep extra water and stick to the map for directions.	2	2		2																					
754	3	"As the cyclist makes his journey towards Yosemite, the setting causes him much worry and concern. In the beginning, the narrator is content and excited. He is doing something that be lovers, is heading for a beautiful destination, and has found a short cut to save him hours of time. He is confidentin the directions given to him by the old men. However, as he continues down the winding road, his environment makes him doubt theirjudgement. The first town he comes to is entirely deserted.Though at first he laughs it off, he laster realizes just how much trouble he in if he didn't come to a civilization soon. The cyclist runs across ""ramshackle shed[s]"" and shut down factories, and as his water supply sinks lower, the road seems to tantalize him. He passes a water pump (just what he needs), yet the water is something close to toxic. A road sign reminds him not go too fast, though he @MONTH1 die if he doesn't pick up the pace. He is forced to look at a picture ofa happy boy guzzling grape juice as he dehydrates. All there features of the setting, in addition to the overpowering heat and sun, drive the narrator to the breaking point.      "	3	3		3																					
755	3	The feature of setting affects the cyclist because every thing that was happing years ago are happen now in todays world meaning wars. Rights & etc todays feature is the same. Every thing is repeating it�s self.	0	0		0																					
756	3	When riding a bike it @MONTH1 not seem to hard. For a cyclist every thing becomes more serious. The determination to win and be the best even if it kills you. In this essay he under estimates the dder cyclist. When really they are the people with more knowledge. Some of the things that @MONTH1 be hard for cyclist are the rough roads. Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke. As road get worse chances get higher tumble weeds and snakes in the way, he was determined to win. After all was said and he faced the horror that nature brought him he knew he was wrong wrong for them and the intelligants.	2	3		3																					
757	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. The fact that he was in the California desert and the heat affected him because he had limited water and was using his energy riding the bike. The �towns� he came across also made an impact on him because of the fact that he couldn�t get more water or a place to rest. �I was doing a water depleating @NUM1 sometimes life can feel so cruel�. This shows how the hilly terrain and dehydration and heat are affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
758	3	Two of the biggest setting in this story is the desert and rolling hills. This would effect the rider becaus of the dehydration that he would experience. Being in the desert would make it obviously hot so you sweat alot and the hills would make it tough on your body because you put extrat strain to get up them. So all together this would be a hard bike ride.	1	1		1																					
759	3	In the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist experiences dehydration on his journey. The cyclist takes directions from older guys who look like they haven�t left their porches in ages. He takes their advice and he then sukkers in the long run because he cannot find water and it is a hot @DATE1. He hikes uphills in the heating sun and fears a heat stroke. There was no sight, not a building, car.	1	1		1																					
760	3	"The setting will either effect the cyclist in a good way or a bad way. In the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie it affects the cyclist in a bad way and a good way. In the story, it continues to talk about lack of water. �When I tried a drop or two it had the flavor of battery @NUM1). This shows that the heat made the water warm, so it did not cool him down. But a good way it affect them is pebbles. ""I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to @NUM2). This shows that even though he has no water the pebbles can make him less thirsty. This is how the setting affects the cyclist. In good way and a bad way."	1	1		1																					
761	3	In this story it is clear how difficult the cyclists journey is. He has to conquer wrong directions, lack of water, rattle snakes and fear of dieng. However he shows great determination and control. An example of his determination is �The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. �This shows his determination that he feels he can go on such a long journey. An example of his self-control is shown in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. When finding this building to be abandoned, and all things, juice, anyone use would have become frustrated and wanted to give up. But not this cyclist he controlled his anger and again showed determination. And it paid off in the end he found his water and survived. This story is a great story that shows determination and self control.	2	3		3																					
762	3	Early in the morning, the cyclist is eager and ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older travelers. He hardly noticed the �sun was beginning to beat down.� He was calm and was looking forward to the �cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� Never once did he imagine what he had gotten himself into. As he began to approach the desert, he noticed he was running low on water. The strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect. The cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put pebbles into his mouth. He had once read, �that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.� The cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across. Dehydration took it�s toll, and he felt hallucinations. He was beginning to lose hope. The heat and the hills and the lack of water had the greatest affect on the cyclist. Had he not been riding through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been fine.	3	2		3																					
763	3	In  the   cyclist   story  the  setting   took  a  huge  roll on  how  the  story    thined   out.The  water  had  a lot  of  effects  on  the  cyclist.The  setting  of the story  took  place  in  the  high  deserts of  california   in  june.As  soon  as  you  read   that  you  now  something  is  wrong.In   the  story  he say  ,the  sun  was  beginning    to  beat  down .This  is going  to  affect  him because  hes  riding  through the desert on  a  bike,which  causes  him  to  become  dehydrated .I  eased  past,trying  to  keep my  balance  in  my dehydrated  state.Thes begining   to  lose  his  mind  because  he  has  no water  because   of  the  setting.Everything  about  the setting  causes  the  cyclist  some  problems.The  heat ,the   setting ,the  lack  of  water  almost  causes him his  life.    	2	1		2																					
764	3	The setting affects the cyclist in alot of ways. The first way is that he was riding in the middle of a desert in June. If he was riding  in @LOCATION1, it woudn't be painfully hot. Also, the rolling hills probablly didnt help If it was mostly down hill, he would have been fine. Riding a bike up a hill when your tired is near impossible.	1	1		1																					
765	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to @ORGANIZATION2 greatlly affected the cyclist. One the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road weren�t the most comfortable to be riding on. In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the path to Yosemite National Park greatlly affected the cyclist. One the way to the park the cyclist came across a big snake that covered the road which greatly frightened the biker. Also the roads were long and very bumpy and windy. The road weren�t the most comfortable to be riding on. There was nothing insight for the cyclist to see. The cyclist did not have much energy because he had no hope for him. The author states, ��  gaining elevation while loosing hope.� Last the weather was hot and dry which tired the cyclist out. He had no water with him and with the weather he had no energy or hope to help him through the journey to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
766	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit the cyclist expirenced a few life threating times during his adventure. The first feature was when was in a deseret with temptures of @NUM1 degrees and his lit bit of water tasted like battery acid. As he tried to keep going he lost hope and thought he was going to die. This affected him because as he lost hope he thought more negative about things and didn�t think he would make it but the he got the agility to move on. In this story the setting affects the characters dramatically.	2	2		2																					
767	3	The feature of the setting is making the cyclist frustrated, thirsty, and confused. The features are making him frustrated by he thought he was going the right way where he really was going out.	1	1		1																					
768	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the features are what cause the climax of the story. An example of this would be the line, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California.� This line shows that the author was in a very hot place, being in a desert, but also that he has a low water supply. These two conditions are what cause the climax, which is the possibility that he could collapse at minute from heat exaustion. This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
769	3	Certin features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he desribes he�s experiences when he cycled through the desert. ''...arrived at the first town''...it fit the traditional difinition of a ghost town. ''at first the cyclist was amused at this town and maybe a little scketle at it because the old �codgers�  told it to be thriving. Halfway through his journey the stated ''sometimes life can be so cruel.� Water was running low and he still had a ways to go untill he made it to the park and he felt as If it would never end. All that he sees aroun him as hills of nothingness under the sorching son with his limited amount of water. No buildings are around the cyclist. The ghost town and the lack of shade or soluation are very features of the setting that make that cyclist feel like a fool for taking advice from older men.        	3	2		3																					
770	3	I am going to explain how the setting of the cyclist affected him. The setting of the cyclist affected him by making him very hot & drinking his water & he would soon run out of water & dehydrate. For example in the story the cyclist would always bring up the little bit of water he had left & around the essay he talked about the dehydration he was seeing & even death. Another example is the relif he had when he drink the water from the sink. In conclusion, this is how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
771	3	This paragraph tells about how careful you should be on the roads.This also talks about what you have to be aware of.There so many things that could happen.You have to take control when your on the road.	1	1		1																					
772	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist in many ways. For example it states �This place might have been a thriving little spot before the last world war it fit the tradition definition of a ghost town.� This statement is talking about town he arrived at when he was trying to get to Yosemite. This would affect the cyclist because he was riding in confidence in the beginning but then the first town he arrives in looks like a ghost town, which would bring his confidence a little bit lower than before. Just like when people travel when they know where they are going they feel good, but once they come to a place they know then they wont feel so confident. Another example is when he has to ride on rolling hills, and then comes across a �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� sign. This would affect the cyclist because then he would be frustrated and stressed out because he rode all that way and not he cant go any further, and that is not the place he wanted to be at. Therefore the features of the setting in �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie affects the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
773	3	The conditions that the bicyclist faced that affected his trip were various amount of things that could really screw your ride up. Some of the conditions were hot It was very hot and that makes it hard to think fast, move fast and make good decisions another would be there was lose gravel and that makes it tough to maneuver and you have to watch your speed. So he�s not going anywhere in a hurry. also there were lets of hills and that makes for an uncomfortable ride and a tiring one atthat. Adding to that he was fresh out of water and that can mean dehydration again bud judjment and even heat stroke or exoustion another bad thing is he was in the middle of nowhere so its not like he could stop. Some where we asks for a drink to, there was nothing around for miles. These things show how rough the rode was made because these conditions exsisted.	2	2		2																					
774	3	The setting was very hot dry and was a desert. This setting effected him be it was making him very dehidarted and hot. It was very hard for him to go any fourther but he knew he had to keep going. Also the land was very barin and ething around. Clearlier the setting effected the biker.	1	1		1																					
775	3	The setting affected the cyclist because they were in California in June traveling back rodes, with no place to stop for water, if the cyclist would have followed the path they intended on following the ride probably have been more enjoyable and he/she wouldn�t of had to worry about a heatstroke or running out of water, they would have been fine.	1	1		1																					
776	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die � �(Kurmaskie).	3	2		3																					
777	3	The main features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the fact that it was June and the dessert heat. �� I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�.� (kurmaskie @NUM1). This helps us realize how bad the heat is in June in the middle of California dessert. This affected the cyclist by his dehydration and the fact that he was inthe middle of no where with no one to help him. This is how the month of June and the dessert heat affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
778	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in this story. First, when he got to the road sign that said �Rough Road Ahead� he was already low on water, but that made things much worse. The rough road made it harder for him to pedal; therefore, he was working harder and getting thirsty. Also, when he stopped at the old Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, he noticed some pebbles on the ground and shoved them in his mouth. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing spit you have left to circulate�. Lastly, �GARY AND WILBER�S FISH CAMP�, could possibly have saved the cyclist�s life. He stopped there and finally got a well deserved drink of water to settle his dehydration and fear. The setting and features severly affected the cyclist throughout his journey.  	2	2		2																					
779	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of he setting affect how the author feels. In the beginning of the essay, the author is confident and happy, and the setting is, �a reservoir camp ground outside at Lodi, California� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This sounds like a good place to be refreshed and to feel confident. Later into the bike ride, the author is affected negatively by the barren area he comes to when he says, �This sight was troubling"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). Finally when he reaches a modern store, he is relieved due to the modern facility when he states, �Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me� (Kurmaskie @NUM3). The area the author goes through has an effect"	2	3		3																					
780	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they don�t ride as much anymore and don�t know the best routes to take. So they just take their old routes, thinking they are still the better way, but when they use them they realize how tiring and bad they are.	1	1		1																					
781	3	�At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..� being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel. The sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point. The sign that said �Rough @CAPS1 ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� had to be intimidating. Considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast. Those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office. yes like the writer said �the world is a fluid place.  Things  change.� The old men probably had close to no due what they were talking about considering things have changed since @NUM1 (when carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, must have been rather intimidating. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more. In eseance I think the setting was a major part why the cyclist felt that way	3	2		3																					
782	3	From what there is in this  picture the cyclist is riding a dry and area which could mean that it is very hab and the cyclsit looks to be going down hill there looks to be a lot of turns. From the body position of the cyclist he seems to be trying at his best and hardest to make it to his destination. All of this could be a bag stress on the cyclist, he maybe sweating really hard and maybe tired the wind @MONTH1 not be helping him at all.	1	1		1																					
783	3	In the short story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� by @PERSON1, a cyclist travels through an extreme climate and tough terrain that nearly end his life to get to his destination. After getting outdated directions from some elderly locals, the protagonist sets off on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Soon thereafter, the cyclist notices something is amiss. The first �town� the locals said he�d find is deserted. And now, twenty miles into his journey, the cyclist needs to refill some of his water supply. The water pump there has �the flavor of battery acid.� With the next town @NUM1 miles away, the cyclist struggles to conserve his water to make it there. Even then, things get worse. As he is, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June�, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� @CAPS1 tell him not to exceed the speed limit of @NUM2 as he does a �water-depleting @NUM3.� eventually, even on his few sips of water, the cyclist finds a spot to fill up on water, knowing now to strike out on better days and better directions.	2	3		3																					
784	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. When she was riding it was very hot this caused the cyclist to lose energy and dehydrate. Also when the cyclist went through a terrain change. The road changed into rolling hills. This caused the cyclist to become tired because after riding up and down your body gets tired. Also being as the weather was so hot this caused the cyclist to drink a lot of water. Eventually she ran out and then got dehydrated. This whole situation implied to stick to your original plan. If the cyclist would have done that she wouldn�t have had to go through the hardships.	2	2		2																					
785	3	Each new feature of the setting in the essay entilled, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, affects the cyclist in some way. For example, in the text , when the narrator stated that he had to avoid a � ridiculously large snake �crossing the road, he became more aware of his surroundings and almost seemed to forget how thirsty he was until he finally abided the large reptile. Also in the text, when, �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view,� hope was replenished into the cyclist. This hope allowed the narrator to because more tenacious about his journey in order to arrive at the old building. Eighther for better or worse, a few feature of the setting arrives and affects the cyclist every step of his journey.  	3	2		3																					
786	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist�s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he @MONTH1 not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let  down for the cyclist�s mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned.	2	3		3																					
787	3	The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was �going to drop from heat exsostion�, he is riding through the desert in @DATE1, and he took directions from three old �gentlemen� sitting on a porch.	1	1		1																					
788	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. First since he was in a desert, the heat of the desert greatly dehydrated him on his journey to the parts. Also, the bumpy roads and rolling hills slowed the bike down to 12 mph since it was to extreme for him to handle at high speeds. When he sees the fist building because he fist is relived but soon after he loses all his hope because it is desserted. Even the old men that living in the area have an affect on the cyclist because they give him out-dated directions that almost @CAPS1 him. Because of this, he will probably rest first an old man�s short tentS again. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
789	3	Well first off its very hot and dry witch can dry a person out easily. And the hills are hard to get up so it would be a challange to get to the top. All I know is the lack of water can kill you if you get heatstroaks easily.	1	1		1																					
790	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At first the cyclist thought that the journey he was about to go on was going to be a good one, but that soon changes. For example, �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porched since Carter was in office.� This quote tells how at first the cyclist thought his journey was going to be a good one, but getting information from two old men soon changed that. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.�  	1	1		1																					
791	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in that a desert-like temperature and the terrain on which he must bike make him more prone to thirst and exhausting. The heat @MONTH1 cause the cyclist to dehydrate faster than normal. This is especially true in this case because of his lack of water. The cyclist might pass out or suffer a heat stroke. The terrain of rolling hills will tire out the cyclist quicker than if he were still on the flat road. His muscle will start to ocha and his body will need water and rest. The story would totaly change if the setting were different. If the cyclist were biking in the @DATE1 on a cold day in the mid @NUM1 he would not have a chance of suffering a heatstroke. There would be a significantly less chance of him becoming dehydrated. The setting is very important in every story and can change everything.	2	2		2																					
792	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s essay �Rough Road Ahead,� the speaker is biking through some rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention long distances. He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the Welch�s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen� (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey.	2	2		2																					
793	3	Desert, Hills and road condition and lack of water �all are how the setting affected the cyclist. First, the cyclist reveals he is in the desert when he exclaims, �I was trave ling throug the high deserts of california in June.� This means it was hot. Second the hills and road condition�s were horrible. The cyclist reveals this when he describes, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,� aid againg  It read: Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. Lastly, He had thought that he would have stops on the way to get water from. So he drank all the rate he wanted. He then figured out the needed to conserve it but by then it was too late. The examples shows that the cyclists condition was harder than he expected them to be.	1	1		1																					
794	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
795	3	The setting of where the cyclist was, was a californa desert in the middle of June. He thinks hes going to die towards the end because of the directions he got. �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches sinse carter was in office.� This means to never take directions from people who haven�t been to the place for  a while.	1	1		1																					
796	3	The setting was a hot desert in California that a biker got stuck in going to Yosemite National Park. These settings were hard on the cyclist. For example, he listened to some old people who led him the wrong way and could have had him killed. He was running out of water and his legs felt like they were going to break off. All of these troubles did affect his trust in old locals though. He learn that just because they are old and looks wise they have information probably older than the artifacts at a museum. Besides he has a trust map: He got a lot from this trip.	2	2		2																					
797	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, in �ghost towns�, there is no-one to ask directions from or to just talk to. Also, some pumped water from water pumps tastes like �battery acid� and could most likely make some one sick. Also, there are poisonous snakes and other dangerous animals.	1	1		1																					
798	3	"There are many features in the story, ""that affect the roles, like out of waters, bad directions. The narrator is ??? and says, ""the water bottles container a few tantalizing sips..� it is say that there is hardly any water left , and he still have to keep going on, until he can find some In the story water is something he has to over come because he is out of it by the time he gets to the fish store."	1	1		1																					
799	3	In this @ORGANIZATION1 I will explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the short story �Rough Road A Head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� The whole ordeal occurs in the �high deserts of california.� @CAPS1 to the text the cyclist had taken �out of date� direction from elderly people who thought they new the way. The cyclist encountered a snake, ghost town ad shutdown factory. Most of the time the cyclist was going over.	1	1		1																					
800	3	The setting in  �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist. He was tacking through the �high desert of California in June�. June is a hot part of the year and since he was in the hottest desert part the hot was multiplied. The terrain changing into �short rolling hills� didn�t help the cyclist. The hills would make any riding more difficult. Anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement. With the person lack of water anyone would be struggling to keep riding on. Most people didn�t have that hints to keep moving. He didn�t set a very goal he just went to the �next Horizon�. Shouldn�t he just wanted to keep going. Another problem with the physical environment was the road conditions. When the �Rough Road Affect� sign appeared the travel then become more difficult. A bike tire take more effort to go over uneven pavement is why the cyclist had so much trouble.	3	3		3																					
801	3	"In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way. With only a few sips of water left he said'' � abandoned years earlieR, by the looks of it it had been a @CAPS1 Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of Juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head.'' When only having a few drops of water and seeing that would have increased my thirst more. Another way the setting affected the cyclist in a hard way was "" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. sometime ife can feel so cruel.'' This remind him that hes not in a car, and that hes not even going half the speed limit. The setting affects the cyclist by reminding him how long his journey is, and now at this point he is suffering."	3	2		3																					
802	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting the cyclsit is in effects him greatly. One evening when he was resting he got into a deep conversation with a couple of elders. Eventually they got to talking about his journey, and the two men gave him direction for a shortcut. �But on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� When he arrives at the first town, he finds it deserted, this effects the cyclist because has eventually going to need more water. As he continues, he comes to a slep in the road. �After I had arrested the first few of these a large highway sign jumped out at most read:ROUGH ROAD AHEAD:DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� This sign was indicating that the road was going to be bumpy, which makes it even more challamging for the cyclsit. So, the setting is very important in this essay because it has a lot to do with how the cyclist feels. When the abandoned towns come into pray, no enging to feel hopeless. When the road get bumpy, he gets tired. When he gets to an actual running store, he�s relieved.	2	2		2																					
803	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the features is just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it. The cyclist gives you what you want and need to know so the affect would be about time the feature is finish play in noone would want to see the cyclist.	0	0		0																					
804	3	"In the story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting of a story is the background, place, and time the story took place. In the story, a cyclist needs to get to @CAPS1 Park. He stops and gets direction from a group of old men, who aren�t up with the times, and the cyclist gets lost. He faces drought, a snake, and being lost in the desert, the cyclist says, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like a diamond back � blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, to"	1	2		2																					
805	3	The cyclist choose the worst time to ride his it was an �early summer evening� in California. At this time the sun is hot and with little water and also lost, it was hot the best choice that he made. A cyclist before do a trip he or she should be prepared for whether conditions and also check a map of the place before going anywhere. 	1	1		1																					
806	3	The cyclist run into a diamond headed snake, is out of water and is in the middle of nowhere the thing I would do is find some rope or cord time old building or tree and hang myself for taking directions from old people  that havent left their porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
807	3	The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the �ghost town� early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned welch�s Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, �It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� @CAPS1, his suffering was through when he discovered a �fish camp,� with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist�s relief was so immense that he,� had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them.	1	1		1																					
808	3	The setting of this story takes place with a man biking and then taking advice from old timers to a faster route. The biker knew from the start that he should have not given his map. But thinking the old folks knew the route he took theyre advice. What the biker should have done was look for someone to ask and make sure the route would work. But jumping to where he wanted to go led him to dehydration and much more struggle than needed. You should always think things out before you take action, just to be safe.	2	1		2																					
809	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he first didn�t know where he was going and took directions from people that he wasn�t really sure about. It was hot he was running out of water he had no idea where he was there were snakes. His water was running out. there were no sings he kept thinking that he would never take directions from an old guys and that he would stick to the future.	1	1		1																					
810	3	At first when he gets the directions from the old men, he thinks he will be fine. When he gets to the first town he�s tired and almost out of water, but still thinks he will be in Yosemite soon. When he gets to the water pump in the middle of the desert, he�s tired and thirsty and he realizes that the directions the old men gave him were out of date. He�s really not happy about listening to them and not following his map. When he gets to the fishing place he is greatful for the water in the sink and for the rest and when the old man offers to give directions to Yosemite he thinks he will just use his map. Throughout the story the cyclists needs change from feeling confident to feeling depressed to feeling relived.	2	3		3																					
811	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting seemed to affect the main character (the cyclist) very much during his pedal, for example, whole the dry desert setting made him think that he could survive with out water, he became dehydrated. The first town, with @NUM1 degree watter could not satisfy his standards. The old velches June factory, was all run down, and is no longer in business, much like the desert, just old barren unuseland. While yes the cycalist survived the pedal, the desert setting opposed a great challenge for him. 	2	2		2																					
812	3	There are many features of the setting that effect the cyclist. One feature is that it is getting hotter and it will eventually effect him. The line �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirge.� shows that the heat  might be starting to effect him. Another feature is that he is in the desert and running low on water. The line �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly� shows that he is drinking a lot of water and is running low. Another feature is that he is riding in the high deserts of California in June. The story says �and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Not only is it in June, but it adds heat because he is also in a desert. There is no doubt he will get dehydrated. Those are some of the many features that effect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
813	3	The setting affect the cyclist because it creates that deserted atmosphere and helps set the mood of the essay. The mood of the essay I think is a sort of dry summer day, the sort of �oh my gosh, its really hot,� type thing. The setting is a dry summer day in June, with a deserted town, tumble weeds and more to contribut to the hopeless feeling. Although he was secured, and didn�t die, it seemed like he would surely not make it judging by the lack of water, scorching hot sun, and distance, with enduring these conditions. So the setting affects the cyclist in a way that could have killed him.	2	2		2																					
814	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because the old guys had worn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. So the features affect reading the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very dangerous and unsafe for people to ride on.	1	1		1																					
815	3	The setting effected the cyclist because it was bumpy and had a lot of hills which means he has to work harder. Also because of the heat he was getting dehydrated in the story after the cyclist had Been rideing a long time it says �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state �(kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist had very little water for his long trip	2	3		3																					
816	3	The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist I think is disgardment. First of all, a reason would be because at the beginning of the story when the warning sign is passed, the cyclist disgards it by going down the hill anyways. Also, it states that it �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.�	1	1		1																					
817	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he went through many ups and downs. At one point flowed by blackish watter feeling somewhere in the neighbor of two hundred degrees.. weather wouldn�t cool down.	1	1		1																					
818	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they caused him to need water. He was worn out because the setting was so intense. �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� This quote from the text shows that the cyclists terrain was changing and they affected him.	2	2		2																					
819	3	The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more, which makes one�s body use more energy. The sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels. Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclist�s will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. The features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going	3	2		3																					
820	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuiou	3	2		3																					
821	3	"The setting acts as a catylist in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is always challenging the character untill the very end. In the story it says �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says �The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.� This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him it also shows how is risle he is, and how satiricle life can be. The ultimate @CAPS1 in this story is when he stumbels across the welches grape juice factory and there was a piture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.� No matter where the cycalist goes he is alway trying to overcome the elements."	2	3		3																					
822	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the lack of water begins to take a toll of how fast he can get to the next town. Another example would be the terrain only slows him down more.	1	1		1																					
823	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him use up the last of his water because it�s hot, and than theres no one around because he's out in the deserts of California. �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� (@NUM1.). This exert from the test supports my previous statement about how it�s hot because the speaker tells us how he�s sweating and that he might be seeing a mirage. �There was no one insight not a building, car, or any structure of any kind� (@NUM2.). This shows that there is no one around to help him if he falls down from a heat stroke or anything like that. So the setting is affecting the cyclists endurance.	2	2		2																					
824	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it more difficult to ride. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� �a large highway sign jumped out atm.� �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit.� �sometimes life can feel so cruel.� The fact the it was such a hot day made the ride seem longer. When out of water you feel exostied. You will do just about anything to try to with stand the heat.	2	1		2																					
825	3	Author Joe Kurmaskie learns the dangers of a lifeless wilderness during his experience described in �do not exceed posted speed limit.� As a cyclist riding in one of the most undeveloped areas in California, the lack of water found in this setting proves crippling to his survival. The trails he was directed to had no towns or sources of fresh, drinkable water for days. The combination of constant exercise riding through the terrain, lack of water and recources, California summer weather and lack of civilization trained the author�s energy and caused him to suffer from dehydration. Too much exposer to these conditions could have killed him. The modern time period and year also caused the directions the author were given to be in accurate, and, thus, causing the cyclist to find him self in such a dangerous area of the country. The setting of �do not exceed posted speed limit� places the cyclist in a life threatening situation.	3	3		3																					
826	3	The features of a setting could be a number of different things. It could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, breezy and humid. The features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. The setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. In the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. These have been what I believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist.	2	3		3																					
827	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example when the author says �flat roads were replace by short rolling hills�, that made the author have to ride safer. Also, when he says,� the ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.� The author had to slow down on his bike and find a safe way around it so he could get past. Finally when the author says �no one in sight�, no building, car, or structure�, he is affected because he can�t ask questions since hes lost and hes thirsty. The setting makes it hard for the author to maneuver and get to where he wants to go.	1	2		2																					
828	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the person who rode the  bike was very tired his legs and body needed a rest after riding on his bike for @NUM1 miles into the pedal. Also it effected the cyclist because of all the riding he had to do struggleing to get where he was trying to get but he was a strong man and he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling. He was also restless but he did it.	1	1		1																					
829	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined.	1	1		1																					
830	3	In the story, the setting greatly effects the attitude of the cyclist. When he starts out, it is an early summer evening, he is serene while he is talking to the old men. He starts cycling the next morning and he is thinking of Yosemite, he is relaxed and confident however, his attitude about the day changes greatly when he comes across the rumshackle old shed, rusty pumps, and a corral at the park in the road. He becomes a little worried but he is not discouraged. When the terrain changes, he is a little discouraged. Then, when he comes across the abandoned factory, he is most definately a lot discouraged. A little later he comes across @PERSON1�s Fish camp, he is very relieved and thankful to the owners. The cyclist�s attitude changed depending upon whether the setting was very beneficial to him or not.	3	3		3																					
831	3	The features of the setting have a great affect on the desperate travels of the weary cyclist. The sometimes disappoint, sometimes uplifting, scenery he passes affect him physically and emotionally when he passes a portrin the road with nothing but a �ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral�� he becomes disturbed.  The cyclist is running low on water when he becomes even more distraught at a road with a speed limit posted as 55 mph, when he was, �doing a water-deleting @NUM1.� The setting of the hot, June sun affects the cyclist and puts him in a state of dehydration. In an, �ironic twist� the cyclist is affected emotionally when he passes a @ORGANIZATION1 factory that has been abandoned. The factory features a picture of a boy pouring a glass of juice into his mouth which upsets the thirsty cyclist.	3	2		3																					
832	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist more than anything in the reading of �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speeding Limit.� In the beginining when the cyclists had just begun his cycling cause he uses a positive tone to describe the setting. For example, in paragraph four he says �the cool pines and running rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. � When he says this the reader imagines someone in an ??? more excited as ??? ??? ??? ??? his destination on a dry day.  As the cyclists attitude becomes lower the reader makes the connection what ?? ?? then because of the setting. In paragraph thirteen when the cyclist says, �I wiped the swear from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage and that not to get too excited� the reader can make the connection that it is getting pretty serious for the cyclist to continue as is. Overall as the setting changes to �burning sun� and extremely hot, with a shortage of water the cyclist becomes more sarcastic and less upheat. For example when taking about the rocks in his mouth he states �with only luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.� This shows a bad mood affected by the features of the setting.	3	3		3																					
833	3	The raugher the road gets for him the more determination he has at the beginning towards the end he had the mind set that, �it didn�t matter it was going to die, �this took a toll on him and it was hard to go on. He realyed he didn�t want to die that way and so he kept on, eventually leading to civilisation.   	1	1		1																					
834	3	The feature of the setting affect the biker a lot because the rough terrain is described which implies that the biker probably had a hard time half way through the story he said, �Flat road was replaced by shor, rolling hills.� He said this to describe the difficulty in this race. It also makes it seem exciting because it changes things around. It wouldn�t be exciting if they said that flat roads turned into even flatter roads, or if they didn�t show the terrain change at all.	1	1		1																					
835	3	Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� an essay written by Joe Kurmaskie, is about a solo cyclist going on a journey to Yosemite National Park. So he listens to a group of old guys and ends up lost on rough road with no water, or relylittic supply of flat road was replaced by short rolling hills large highways lon jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� The rough road made have to work harder want more water and just made things tougher more than what they already were.	2	2		2																					
836	3	The settings of your environment always seem to affect your mood. Take for instance the cycler. In the beginning he had a positive attitude but once he arrived at the first town his attitude started to go down from there. He explains describes the town as maybe at one point being a thriving spot, �but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� Ghost towns come across very old, run down and dull. That affected the cyclist because by it not being like the old men said he was becoming doubtful, which in turn doesn�t give you the same motivation as when he started. Then when he get to what is suppose to be water and a, �tar like substance oozed out.� That makes him nevers and mad because he isn�t sure he will make it. But his attitude changes as soon as he sees the store. The setting becomes positive and so does he. So, the setting does effect the cyclists mood and attitude.	2	2		2																					
837	3	Many of the settings features affect the cyclist. One of the features of the dessert like, which is the setting, is the dry air and hot temperatures. This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, �I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.� @CAPS1 feature of the setting was the desolet towns that didn�t contain any water. This lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to sucking on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulates. @CAPS1 features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch�s Grape factory. This  factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state. The narrator called the factory.�Ironic  twist.�	3	3		3																					
838	3	The effects from the setting that has an effected on me is that while riding on the bike in hot weather with only a little bit of water to drink because I would have giving up have nothing to drink. The water had to be hot.In the text it sayed �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�, I don�t think I could have lasted long, if I was dehydrated. From the look of it I would have drop dead of heatstroke.	1	1		1																					
839	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. For instance, in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the lack of water in the dry desert gave a long lasting affect on the cyclist. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� This shows the reader how all the heat and shortage of water has made the cyclist feel very hot dehydraded and that she could pass out any second. She is also thinking beyond that by just laughing at herself and trying to conserve every bit of energy she possibly can. As a result, the affect from the setting on the cyclist is that lack of water has given her humor and courage to keep going, to get to her final destination point.	3	2		3																					
840	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The bumpy roads. Sand in the eyes, thirst hit him too hot and humid tempures. Maybe he got tired of pedaling had to walk. A wild dog chased him went he got in town. Had no money to buy a drink	1	1		1																					
841	3	The cyclist of this story is greatly affected by the heat of his souroundings. While he riding to @CAPS1, the heat of the day began to increase. The text reads � I had been hitting my water bootle regulary. �@CAPS2 to the heat of the day, the cyclist was down to his water consuming large patterns of it at a time. He 	1	1		1																					
842	3	When the cycleist mentions how hot and dry and open the terrain is, it makes me feel like he is in the desert. I also know that it�s hot because he is swreating and dehydrated.	1	1		1																					
843	3	"At first the cyclist feels fine, he gets a little bit discouraged, but basically he�s fine. �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them� (@CAPS1). He feels relaxed, because he is at home with the water and the pine trees. They give him a sense of comfort. He thinks that after the first ""tree"" not being that much of anything, the others will be better. He knows that he has it in him to make it, but he doesn�t know yet that he will have to travel a long way to get water. When he sees the sign, �It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT.� he knows that things are going to get rough, because �the speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph�. At that point he starts to get worried, because he is out there more alone, and he realizes that he doesn�t have water. As he runs out of water, the landscape, and his surroundings, start to get drier and drier. He states, �tumble weeds crossed my path.� The landscape seems to get more threatening too, �a ridiculously large shake.� The landscape changes with the state of water."	3	3		3																					
844	3	The setting affects the cyclist because the heat and no humanity makes him so crazy. If he was in a place like @LOCATION2. It would be just the heat because there are people every were in @LOCATION2 @LOCATION2. If he was in @LOCATION1 it would be the severe temperature drop and no humanity and he would probably die.	1	1		1																					
845	3	the features of setting that the cyclist run into does affect him. For example when the setting changes from abandoned town to an empty deserted rond that no been on in thirty years; gives a cyclist less motivation him self to go on and even less strength.	1	1		1																					
846	3	Joe Kurmaskie�s �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� tells how a cyclist takes directions from older men who don�t tell him correctly the way to get to Yosemite, so the cyclist ends up lost with hardly any water. Features of the setting such as the terrain and the sun affect the cyclist in the story. The sun was very hot on a summers day and without water makes it even difficult to keep moving because he was so hot and thirsty. @PERSON2, �The sun was beginning to beat down� I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The terrain was also bumpy and rough to travel on. The sun and the terrain can affect the cyclist very much when out on a hot day in the summer.	3	1		3																					
847	3	The features of the setting taunt the cyclist with cruel irony. As the cyclist continues down his path he pasts through a ghost town, then twenty mile up the road he sees a ramshackle shed & some rusty water pumps. He attempts to get water out because he was runing out but all he could get was muck, then what he described as �water feeling two-hundred degrees, it had the flavor of battery acid. Further down the road was a sign that said rough road ahead, adhere to the posted speed limit of 55, he was going 12 mph. Even worse he found an abandoned juice factory on the way, at that point he was out of water.	2	2		2																					
848	3	Do not Exceed posted speed limit, never accept travel advice from a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confinses of their porches sin Carter was in the office twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork as sorrs. I got down on my hands and kness, working the handle of the rasted water pump with all my strength. The water bottles contained only a few totalt and sips. He could or been sad person. And he could just be a bum.	2	1		2																					
849	3	The features of the setting could affect this cyclist. In this case it do effect the cyclist. According to the text �Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� This is a good example because he knew that this road was going to be rough and he was only going 12 mph. So the features of the setting did effect the cyclist. 	1	1		1																					
850	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much in this. The hot weather made him have a dry mouth leading to the lack of water. He used stones in his mouth and he said, �I�d read once that sucking of stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate."" He used that to help him survive the ordeal."	1	1		1																					
851	3	"The features affected the cyclist in many ways, one being the highway sign, ""ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT."" The terrain was now short, rolling hills, which would make it harder on the cyclist to pedal up the hills, for it would take a lot more effort and energy. Also, there were roadblocks, �at some point, tumbleweeds blocked my path and a ridiculously large snake �These roadblock would danger the biker, for he�d have to manever around them, losing time and energy, resulting in drinking more water. No water is a great danger for it was June, a hot day and he is risking getting dehydrated. There was also nobody around, so if he desperatly needed water he couldn�t"	2	2		2																					
852	3	After reading �Do not Exceed Posted Limit� I have seen how the scene of an area can effect your mood and attitude around things. In this story, the main character is a cyclist who takes the advice of a few old men sitting in a poseh who tell him a bad shortcut. As he is riding, he comes across some hills. Those hills really affected him physically he gets tired from peddling up and down continually. �that mood� was replaced by short, moving hills.� The cyclist could not er nuertecy tried everything, not showing how long he have to continue going up and down. There at one point he says, �@CAPS1 can feel so cruel.� There, he is upset because a road sign come up through acid tough roads, and told him not to exceed 55 miles per hour when he was fully going 12 miles per hour. This can be viewed as metaphorical also. When you take a short cut in life, there are always consciences as you decide to drop out of high school is go on how with your journal, where is always the posibility of is not working, and where you cry with no diploma ?? and he gets a job	3	3		3																					
853	3	In the short story, Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting effects the cyclist in the story. For example, the dry hot air begins to  slowly dehidrate him, causing the cyclist to lose all sense of reason, the heat also played tricks on his mind. Also, the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them. This, also with the heat factor, caused him to use up his much needed water supply. The setting in this story deeply effects the cyclist. 	2	2		2																					
854	3	Features from the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in he was in had a major affect. He was in cali. which is a big dessert. In the middle of some it is very hot. Bike riding on roads in the dessert with no trees or shade of any sort is quet harsh. And to be riding around where there is not much civilazation as to where you can�t get water is a major issue.	1	1		1																					
855	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there is poisonous snake out thre. Your the only person ridin dow those hills all by your self. The guy had said that the next town was @NUM1 miles from where he was at. The lack of water that there were not any streams or rivers around there just in a desert with nothing.	1	1		1																					
856	3	The setting is mid summer in California in the desert. It is hot, humid and very dry. There is a lack of water in his bag. He is on a trip, going down the lost, rough and rigorous roads.	1	1		1																					
857	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because it was a hot June day in a desert in California. For example, your in the desert cycling for many hours very hot and only have limited water. This affects the author because you have to conserve the water that you have to be able to make it to the park. Anothe example, is that you are going up and down rolling hills and you legs get very tired so they don�t want to move any more. And the best example is the sun is beating down on you and your sweating so much and @MONTH1 be seeing thing but all you want to do is see something that has water. These are all things that affected the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
858	3	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become deyhdrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water.	1	1		1																					
859	3	There are many ways that the features of the setting affect the cyclist. For example the cyclist was in a very hot and dry place. Meaning there was no water any where to be seen in miles. Also towns were nowhere to be seen for it would be hard to substain life out there. This quote supports there weren�t many towns, ''About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town.''This shows there aren't many towns in these parts, @CAPS1 so hot and thirsty as the text claims, ''I read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst ''this clearly shows the  man wa very thirsty. Also shows the man was very thirsty. Also @CAPS1 so hot out there the man could see visions as the text states, ''As the looks ofter had been a grape juice factory and bottling plant.'' why would there be a grape juice factory in the middle of no where. Therefore these statements above show how settings can affect ones mind and physical conditions to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
860	3	The setting that affect the cyclist is the condition of the road because the road turns all different ways and the road goes up hill so it makes it harder to go up the road the cyclist has @NUM1 miles befor he gets to a town he could run out of water. If he run out of water befor he gets there, he might have to make stops so he doesn�t make hisself sick. When he gets to the town he can get more water.	1	1		1																					
861	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making him hot and thristy most of his way. As he rode he started to get tired slowly and he got work and more thirsty. He drank his water at first with out thinking to much or it, but as he went on he slowly found himselfs trying to conseve it. By the time he got to the second wild town the will he was so thirsty and tired thathe thought it might of been a ""death"" So he wiped the sweat from his eyes."" to make sure it wasn't a mirage. The only time people see mirages is when the are hot,tired, and about to kill for some water. This is what the cyclist was like after his long jouney to Yosemite National Park with the directions given by old men."	2	1		2																					
862	3	The features of the setting include �There are no one in sights, not a building, car, or structure of any kind which describes the trail the cyclist was taking. These features of the setting describe how the cyclist is affected because it elaborates on his doubting whetther he will survive or not.	1	1		1																					
863	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. The speed limit sign makes him feel like life is cruel. His first glimpse of the welch's Juice factory makes him feel excited. Meeting the deserted fork in the road makes him feel troubled. When he finally gets there, he feels relieved. These are all examples showing that features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
864	3	The many features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist & his performance. For example, the cyclist is riding through a very hot area of California. This is said at the end of paragraph @NUM1: ,�and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The high deserts of California are windy, sandy, dry, and hot. Not something that someone should be cycling on, had the setting, told of the mountianous regions of California, the wither would hot be hot, or tired because the mountians are a cool, although dry place. Had I had been cycling, I would rather have cycled in a different setting, such as mountians, than an arid desert. that way I would not have to endure the discomfort a cyclist expearenced.	1	1		1																					
865	3	The features setting in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� are very important to the cyclist. In this story, the setting really affected the cyclist because it was in California which is a really hot place during the summer. The cyclist had problems because of the weather and on the shortness of water. Since there was a shortness of water he had to conserve it which slowed him down because he couldn�t ride as much. Although there was a cool wind and a river from Yosemite he had to pass quickly down the hill so he had even more problems. This is why the settings of the story really affected the cyclist and how much he could ride.	1	1		1																					
866	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting, affect the cyclist in many ways. In the story, it taliks about how the man is pedling twenty miles here and fourty miles there and it's very hot outside and he only has so much water abd he doesn't think he'll make it to where he was to go because its do not that he need more water. As the narrator sas"" I was travelling throuhg the high deserts of california in June"" which is extremely not in california in June. The deserts hot weather made him eimited on water supply, and the fact that he was in the middle of nowhere, no buildings around makes him lose all hope for making it through. There were snakes in the desert which endagered him, and the bumpy road made it harder for him to hold on and get to somewhere. "" I began breaking the ride into distance i could see on te horizon, telling mself if i could make it treat i'd be fine."" This quote shows his struggle because of the area he was in but also his persitance. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this essay."	3	2		3																					
867	3	Many features of the cyclist�s surroundings effect his speed and confidence. He was the only one on the road. There were no other cars, bikes, motor cycles, or even buildings. It�s like he�s on the countryside. So that makes him want to go faster, because he won�t hit any thing. The fact that he�s alone in the wide, open spaces boosts up his energy level and makes him feel more confident.	1	1		1																					
868	3	To be able to have a good bike ride, you must have a good setting. To me, a good setting would about @NUM1� outside and sunny. You can�t go bike riding in snow because there is no way that the tires will move in the snow. You can�t go in rain or hail because the roads get slippery and you could getin a accident that could injure or kill you. If it is sunny outside you be able to ride freely on dry roads with a little breeze to go through your hair and you could be refreshed. That is why I believe it is important for the setting to be just right for a bike ride.	1	1		1																					
869	3	this story is set in the hot in the hot desert in June and the character is a cyclist trying to get to a National Park. the setting affects the cyclist because the hotter it is the more water you need to keep you hydrated, but the man is alone in the desert. This quote �about forty miles in the pedal I arrived as my first �town�. The place might have been a thriving little syos as one time�. This quote shows how deserted the desert is and how as he rides there is nobody around no where to re-hydrate no where to get drecionsn he was alone.	2	2		2																					
870	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park, thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town. The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store. If it hadn�t been so hot, if the �towns� along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadn�t been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the affore mentioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
871	3	Hot, terrain, middle of nowhere- all are features of the setting that affected the cyclist. First, the hot weather in California made the cyclist thirsty and almost dehydrated. There was no place to stop for water and if there was, the water was bad and warm. Second, the different types of terrain made the cyclist really thirsty also and tired. Lastly, the cyclist was in the middle of nowhere. He couldn�t get water to hydrate himself or to sit down and rest.	2	1		2																					
872	3	The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one. He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long  in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the author�s terrain. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I don�t have to bike in that terrain.  	2	1		2																					
873	3	The cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1� was riding through the California dessert in June. This dry, bare setting made it impossible to find any source of water. The only time that this cyclist found water was when it @NUM1 and tasting of battery acid. There was nowhere for him to find water for miles. This lack of water and scorching heat made him travel slow and wearily. He even says that he could only go 12 mph in a 55 mph zone. By taking the advise of the old men and taking a �short cut�, the cyclist past through ghost towns with no water. This �short cut� prolonged his trip, most likely by hours If he had gone through populated area despite the fact that it is a longer path, there would have been more water to drink, which would allow him to go faster. The dry, hot setting of the old men�s �short cut� made this cyclist�s trip last much longer than nessiarry.	3	2		3																					
874	3	When the man began cycling he thought that this was going to be an easy for ride. For example in paragraph @NUM1 he says �Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� As he got further he realized that he was in the middle of nowhere. The scenery was getting more and more empty. There was eventually nothing. The scenery was putting down his hope of ever getting out of the desert. For example: In paragraph @NUM2 it states, �a large highway sign jumped out of me. It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� He realized this was going to be hard. He had to travel in bumpy roads and pass snakes without getting bit. The scenery created a sense of hopeless because it was abandoned. When he saw the bait shop, his spirits lifted and he was now hopeful and relieved.	3	2		3																					
875	3	When the cyclist began his journey he was confident in succeeding. Throughout the story however, the cyclist endures many conflicts to his successs in his journey. The cyclist faced his first difificulty once he reached a small, abandoned town. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist realized he had not conserved his water and his �water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips� (kurmaskie @NUM1). On top of his water problem the heat was unbelievable. He was losing hydration from all the sweat, and he was losing it quickly. The cyclist was also dealing with the difficult roads. There were many things this cyclist endured through-out his journey, but he was determined to finish his trip and was filled with satisfaction once he overcame these hardships.	2	2		2																					
876	3	The features of the setting put an affect on the cyclist. The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds, and a ridiculously large snake. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play.	2	2		2																					
877	3	One main feature of the setting that affects the cyclist is the heat of the day. If you ride a bike in the heat of the day, you are going to use up a lot of water. Another factor is the limited supply of water. The final factor is the wrong directions from the aged men. Aged people aren�t always wrong but their info. Can be out of date.	1	1		1																					
878	3	The features of the setting in the essay affect the cyclist because as he was riding his bike throughout California, he entered hot deserts and was almost out of water. The cyclist was in a very bad dehydrated state as he was riding his bike, looking for water or anything drinkable that would successfully get rid of his dehydration. After a little while, the cyclist found himself alone in the desert with no one in sight. An example of this would be �There was no one in sight,not a building, car, or structure of any kind. Another example to show how the cyclist was struggling and fighting against dehydration is �wise rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june simply because i listened to some gentlemen who haden�t been off their porch in decades shown how the settings of this essay affected the cyclist greatly.	2	2		2																					
879	3	During the authors ride to Yosemite, he doesn�t have the proper tools to go along the long stretch of desert he was to face, and by tools I mean water. The California desert is extremely hot and can be potentially dangerous depending on your situation the author was describing how the lack of water was affecting him. He described this with sentences like �Rattled around the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.� The author clearly cannot face the rugged heat with his immense lack of water. The author was getting neat stroke being passed by @LOCATION2  desert snakes and tumbleweeds. The author was clearly in a struggle against the @LOCATION2 desert heat.	2	3		3																					
880	3	The settings and features are very important to cyclists one because water and food try might carry a waterbottle and a snack but they need to know  where they are going and if they will need to bring extra or not. In the story I just read he didn�t bring enough to last him so he got some directions but they were bad so he was in trouble. Its important that a cyclist knows where their going and whats around them so they don't get lost and have no acsess to food or water.	2	1		2																					
881	3	"The features of setting effected the cyclist because he was in a desert in the month of June which was really hot and dry, there were also no trees around so there was no shade for him to relax in so the sun was also beating on his back. There was also lots of hills that took his strength to jump for example it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" There was also a big crazy twist in his way. He even saw a snake. All of these things made him really tired for example he didn't have much water and the sun was making him hot and dehydrated. There was no shade so he had to just take the sun beating down on his back. He had to jump over hills so that took alot of energy. He had to ride up one long hill so that also made him tired. All of these things happened back to back without giving him a break, so it really tired him out."	2	2		2																					
882	3	In the story it explained the beauty of the night, also about the outdoors and how it is effecting his trip. The features of the setting effects the cyclist, because the setting was mild, sounded warm and calm. Also it showed how it contains to us. The setting was similar to the cyclist. That�s how the features of the setting effects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
883	3	The cyclist was in California in June, the sun was beating down on him this made the ride difficult with short water supply The man came upon several towns that were abandond which made his water supply less. The terrain was long and straight then turned into tall hills which had to be difficult to ride.	1	2		2																					
884	3	How the features of the setting affects the cyclist is the condition of the roads, rolling hill, and the?? heat. The conditions of the road in the settings affect the cyclist because the roads are rough. An example firm the texted is � I noticed that terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short ralling hills. These condition make is hard for the cycled it gives him a challenge.  The rolling hills challange him a regret to stay on the road it is easly tricky and challenges so was The heat & sun was also played an affection on the cyclist. An Examples from the @CAPS1 is.� I chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on. The sun was beginning to heat doing but I barely not ???. the sun was not starting to get him  ?? sharply ??  It will start to get ????? when is ?? is high deserts. I conclude that these features in the setting affected the cyclist in many ways but he keep pushing himself to more on.  	3	2		3																					
885	3	In the setting of Do Not Exceed Posted Speed  Limit, is riding a bike really fast on a rough road.	0	0		0																					
886	3	The cyclist had a couple of affects in his journy. One of them was he hills the it was a problem because it used most of his energy and slowed him down. The other one was water, the lack of water. If the had enerf water he would have gotten a boost that would have kept him going.	2	1		2																					
887	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. Firstly, the cyclist had been pedaling through the �high deserts of California�, making a hint that the temperature was hot and dry, and therefore he must�ve been getting thirsty regularly and exhausted from the sun beating down on him. Second, he began to ride through hills, and as common sense would be used, hills are much harder to ride on a bicycle especially up hill, and it wears you down. These hills, along with a lack of water must�ve tired him out and given him extreme difficulty to make it without much water. As you can tell, the difference in setting plays it�s crucial part on the cyclist and his precious water supply.	2	2		2																					
888	3	The setting affects the cyclists because he can not take the heat. His water supply is running how and he is dehydrated. It says this when the characters says. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide wings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from head strok� This is saying he is afraid he might pass out and die before he finds more water.	2	1		2																					
889	3	The setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first place he arrived at was a �ghost town� Then he reach a water pump about twenty miles up the road. The water was very hot and tasted very nasty. The text states, ��water feeting somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. Then he had to travel without water and became dehydrated. Travelling up and down hills he thought he began to imaginate a building that could possibly provide he with water. The building was there but it was abandoned. He decide he was going to such on a couple of pebbles. The text says, �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thrist��	2	2		2																					
890	3	"It is my hot so the cyclist is very dehydrated, tired and lack of water. �I checked my water supply and heated on� is a good example oF this. There is also a lot of sad and deserted places with no cars around this bars the cyclists hope of finding civilization. Also not seeing any building and when he sees are it being deserted makes this very hard on the rider. Another event that takes a toll on him is when he @CAPS1 the pump that has tar, dirt, then hot water in it. Also the road plays a toll on him. I know this house he says �If I could just make it to that next horizon/hill I�ll be alright"".This is how I know the setting and features in the setting is affecting the cyclists mentally and physically."	1	1		1																					
891	3	Hot, alone, no water � all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is very hot as the cyclist is riding. This makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated. The cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight. If anything happened to him there is no one to help. The cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy. With very little water it is hard to stay hydrated. Hot, alone, no water- all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
892	3	The terrain that a cyclist is riding on has a big affect on them. The first example of this is in they are riding on hills, it makes it much harder for them. For example when the rider in the story saw that he was going to have to ride on hills he was, olcasly disappointed. Another thing that affects cyclist is the smothness of the road they are riding on. In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the main character came to rough spot in the road and was disappointed and didn�t want to ride it. Another aspect that can affect cyclists is the heat. Several times in the story, the cyclists says that he is tired and dehydrated, at one point he thinks he is going to die of heatstroke. Those are the effects of the rider�s setting have on him/her.	2	2		2																					
893	3	"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" has a major effect on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..       "	3	3		3																					
894	3	In the story �Do not Exceed Posted Speed limit� the cyclist sees many different settings when he left it was early summer and it was pretty hot outside. He rode into the morning when would make him tired. The first town he reaches upon was a ghost town so that means he could rest get his supplies. Then he arrive by cool pines and rushing river which probably makes him feel releaxed. Then he showed up at a ramshack shed with several rusty pumps and a carrol that couldn�t hold in the lamest made. Gated men which people made him feel uncocleible, and the pumps did not give him water so that was nobody also pointing. Then he was rideing through the California deserts in June witch probably made him more dehirrated.	2	2		2																					
895	3	The cyclist should have never taken the advice from the older men. The map would have been a lot safer and easier. People seem to always look for a shortcut, including myself. He could have died from heat stroke and lack of water. He did have perseverance though he never gave up and that is what saved him. Being in that situation and setting I would have given up.	2	2		2																					
896	3	When cycling it�s important to make yourself aware of the type of terrain it is, make sure of the weather, make sure of the environment, and most importantly make sure of your resources. These things are key before taking any cycling trip. They are very important in determining the type of trip you will have and enjoyable and relaxing trip, or a long and miserable trip.  	1	1		1																					
897	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by travelling very far where he is going. For example, ""About forty miles into the pedal I arrived at the first town."" good thing that he is taking water or who knows if he would of survived or not. I think the biggest mistake was that he asked probaly someone that had not ever been on the road for directions. When he asked the person he ended up at a sign that said Rough road Ahead: Do not exceed, that was the moment I felt sorry for him, and that was probaly the effective feature that has happen to him."	2	2		2																					
898	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed� by @PERSON1 the settings of the story effects the rider in manyways. The first and most obvious is the temperature, it is hot, therefore the rider is hot and becoming dehydrated making him thirsty. A second way the setting affects the rider is the fact that nothing is around him. Since nothing is around him there is no where for him to get water adding to the affect of dehydration making him more thiristy. The rider says �One ran shacle shed, sevral rusty pumps, and the corral that couldn�t hold the lamestmal egreeted me. ''This statement from the author support the factt that nothing is around. Onemore feature of the setting that affected the rider was the hills. The hills made the rider tired requiring more pedalind and wearing him out, the setting features had agreat afect on the rider from heat and dehydration to hills and energy. onething that the setting didnt have was a positive affected on the rider.	2	2		2																					
899	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting affected the cyclist. It was a hot June day and the water supplies he had was running out. He got the wrong directions homThese old men so he would had to ride  his bike longer than he had to and he would need water from pedaling all that way for nothing. Since he was going in the wrong direction there were no buildings for him to get water, there were no people so he couldn�t communicate and there would be no one to call for help incase he was over heated from the heat.	2	2		2																					
900	3	In the story, the rider faced several meloncholy sites. For examples the �ghost town� that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for futher directions or somewhere to freshen up. Futher on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obsticle that he had to go over. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back. He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him.	3	2		3																					
901	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way. For example, A tarlike substance oozed followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This affects him because cant get water from the well. So this means he needs water, but cannot get water. Also in the essay it says the terrain is bad so that means that the cyclist has to pedal harder to keep moving and he has to work harder to hot reek. So all this puts affect on him from just whats around him. The old abbandon factory with the boy drinking juice was had the  most effect on the cyclist because he was so thirsty and that was when he was about to give up. In this essay the setting had alot of affect on the cyclist to were he thought he might die."	2	2		2																					
902	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The speaker tells us that he�s riding his bike in the middle of the desert in June. This shows the author is probably very hot. The author tells us that the road turned into hills and bumps. This would make it more difficult for the author because he would have to use more energy to move up the hill. And lastly, the cyclist tells us that the �towns� he came to were abandoned and uncared for. This would not be good for the cyclist because he would be able to get water for his trip.	2	2		2																					
903	3	The @CAPS1 is affected in many ways. The major thing that effects him is the lack of water. Throughout the story he mentions the lack of water. He also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route. For example, �I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off thire porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� The @CAPS1 says things about the older gentle man throughout the story.	2	2		2																					
904	3	Setting very much affects the cyclist and now he feels. If he was in a bad setting then he would most likely be in a bad mood. Mood is highly affected by the general setting. In the essay �rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit� the cyclist feels very confiedent of himself and the setting helps to boost that confiedence and andorence.	1	1		1																					
905	3	The features in the setting of the essay affected the author greatly. The Hills, on a hot day, with no water, or nearby town is really rough, expecially if you�ve been riding for more than @NUM1 miles. The environment of the hot June weather near a dessert area can cause serious problems, for example heat stroke and since he had no water to drink dehydration caused a lot of fear in the author. The setting of the essay and the conditions the author were under were extreamly dangerous and hes lucky he made it out alive.	2	2		2																					
906	3	That the cyclist is steyetling down up totally end steep within when to get to his destination of the town settle out are taken mean yesterday. The condition in hand and hurry some when and have one his body.  	1	1		1																					
907	3	In the short story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting greatly affects the cyclist. For example. In the beginning of the story, the cyclist is eager to get to Yosemite National Park. He listens to the advice of, old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their parches since carter was in office, �and quickly realized that he shouldn�t have. The author describes the setting of the first �town� as, �the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This didn�t bother the cyclist as much as his next sight. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and corral that couldn�t hold in the largest mule.� Was what met him there. The cyclist said that �this sight was troubling.� It is obvious that the cyclist has given up hope when he says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This short story shows how anything can get even the best of travellers worried about their survival.	2	2		2																					
908	3	 I think the features of the settings affect the cyclist because the knowledge of the cyclist is limited example, �old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office�, meaning now its time for the older people to relax and watch of younger people.	1	1		1																					
909	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because where he is riding it is very dry and hot. He can deal with the heat with his good water supply, but when it runs out he begins to get disoriented. For example in the text he writes �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirrage,� That statement shows that the cyclist was hot, and the images around him making him feel more hot than what he is, and his lack of water made him almost belive that he was imagining seeing a building. Another example is �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hang my head.� This quote shows that the cyclist is in complete despair as he looks at the photo and hangs his head. This shows that the cyclist was constantly being reminded how hot and thirsty he was everywhere he would  go and he couldn't get a drink. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
910	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affected the cyclist in the story. �Not two miles into this next reaction of ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (kurmaskie). the cyclist is travelling through hot, dry California in the middle of June without much water left. The fact that he now has to travel up and down short hills is going to make him even more tired, because going over hills requires more energy, than flat riding. This energy, loss coupled with the cyclist lack of water causes him to become even more miserable. The setting of this story greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
911	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist mood and behavior. First the cyclist sees from believing the shortcut will help him arrive to Yosemite faster then he relies it wont. Next, the harsh sun and rafh terrain and lack of water causes the cyclist to give up hope that he will make it to yosemite and causes him to rethink his judgement and taking advice from others.	1	2		2																					
912	3	"The setting affected the cyclist in a harsh way. At first, the cyclist was fine and going strong, but soon after the first ""ghost town� he was getting weak. Then the cyclist had to face a few problems. For example he was running low on water. Also, he faced rough roads last, he faced snakes and abandonment. The cyclist had to face many obstacles, but in the end, he pulled through strong."	1	1		1																					
913	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist for these reasons. It says �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldnt hold in the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling.� That showshow how the features affected the cyclist because he says the sight was troubling. It  troubled him because he wanted water and he seen the rusty pumps that reminded him of water but he new their was no water or it was nasty	1	1		1																					
914	3	The conditions of the enviroment as well as the road can majory effect the cyclist. For example If some one was riding a bike in warm wheather on flat land it would not take major determination to pedal. On the other hand if it is hot and rough paths and hilly roads the biker colud dehidrate and it takes much more effort to get up and over the hill. Those five the conditions of the enviroment effect a cyclist greatly.	2	1		2																					
915	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist, on his way to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the rough deserts of California. As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, as is the sand. There is no water anywhere and dangerous, highly venomous creatures are abundant. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grope juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere. Until, finally, he reaches a modern area and drinks from the sink in the bathroom.	2	2		2																					
916	3	In the story the setting plays a big role in effecting the cyclist. The terrain was very hard at times such a big hills and windy torns. Also, there was no one around. no houses, buildings or people which made him fell alone and life he was going to die. The author describes the terrain in one part of the story �Over onelong, crippling hill a building came into view! This quote shows how the hills in the seting were very big and hard to get over. It also shows the significance of a single building and how excited he was to see it. In the story the author described many features from the setting which all greatly effected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
917	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places starting off with this man took advice from many older men, which don�t even know the area anymore. So riding through this man seems lost, he is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas. He starts out good, then comes to a �Rough Road� and he even says �sometimes life can feel so cruel�. Then he come to this large snake in the middle of the road scary enogth he has to slow ride past this thing taking up most of the road. Coming over these thing was very strong and hard of this young man.	2	3		3																					
918	3	The dessert environment had huge effects on the cyclist. He had been drinking his water regularly and would be running out. Not realizing, their would be no refills because the pump was only giving � tarlike substance� said the text. With the lack of water dehydration was beginning to hit the poor man. An effect of dehydration is poor balance that would have been useful to pass the � ridiculously large snake� he had seen. A finale effect would be mirages that could loose your judgement. This man double checked his eyes, when coming in view of a building, by �[wipping] the sweat from (his) eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage,� Through all the toughest desser obsticles the character was able to take the short cut and survive heat, dehydration, and animals of the dessert.	2	2		2																					
919	3	"I think the features in the setting of the story ""Do not exceed the speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, highly affect the cyclist. Some implied a information would be that it is very hot out, and the people in towns didn't help him. I know that it is not because the text says,""somewhere in the neighbourhood of @NUM1 degrees."" This implies that it is very hot outside. I can tell the people in towns didn't help him because the text says, ""Never accept travel advice from collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""This shows that the people in towns didnn't help him. Some expressed information in this text would be that there is a rough road, and a shake was in his way. I know this is expressed because it tells you right in the text. ""Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. ""This comes right out and tells you there is a rough road. You know there is a shake because the text says, ""and rediculously large snake blocked the majority of the road. I think there are many implied t expressed information in the story""do not exceed the speed limit. "	3	2		3																					
920	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a larger way, almost resulting in a very sevior situation. The cyclist was in a desert. Like terria, which was not dinsely populated on his trail, there was a lack of fresh water supplys, and the tempatures is more extreme. The cyclist could easily have faintid from heatstroke, due to the lack of water and excessive heat and work that his was doing peatling. Had the area been more populated, he would have had more chances to stock up on water greatly indecriasing his risk of heat stroke. There was also the snakes which presentid danger for him, has he been bitting then he would be at least @NUM1 miles from the closet help which could proven fetal. Had the setting been, say a city park, on a populated country side, them thi setting would had provided exponeutaly loss prodioms and dangers for the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
921	3	The conditions and features of the setting caused the cyclist to be tired and dehydrated and think that he was going to die from it. For example, it says �and ther growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a georgus day in June�. Also , he thinks he is getting dehydrated when he says �I  was doing a water depleting 12 mph. sometimes life could be so creul�. in conclusion, this cyclist started this without enough water causing him to think that he was going to die from either heatstroke or dehydration.	2	2		2																					
922	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he�s in the middle of nowhere with no water. The cyclist had to ride his bike for over @NUM1 miles trying to get to Yosemite. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly.� This quote shows that he just beginning to run of of water. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This quote shows how he really had nothing to drink at all. Having no water in the high deserts of California while riding your bike for over @NUM1 miles is not a good @CAPS1 unless you have a car. 	2	1		2																					
923	3	In the essay the setting had every thing to do with  the cyclist cause he is ridding through the desert with batey tay water. He is pedaling through the dry heat thats tough even you had water pluse there were hills deadly snakes.Its dangerous enough with out that stuff being there. So I would listen to the cyclist & never ever listen to old men.	1	1		1																					
924	3	On the cyclists rideto Yosemite National Park he encouters a lot of hardships due to the setting hes around and the advice given by oldmen. The cyclist riding his bike in the middle of June in the deserts of california isnt good to begin with adding to cyclist dehydration state. He first come to encouters ''one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn`t hold in the lament mule'' By that description oF his lecatracy it seems as if he might be in ghost town by himself almost could strand him. He described the terrain with �short, rolling hils.'' and ''over one long, crippling hill.'' This shows some of the obstacle that he had to go through in a bike, just to get to Yosemite National Park. He @CAPS1 realized once he encounterd these Features oF the terrain that he was oFF track and needed to find help. After his survival of his surroundings For as long as he could go, @CAPS1 gets help at a real camp. That is how the settings of the story play role in the cyclist epidemic.	2	2		2																					
925	3	�Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� is an inspiring and almost humorous essay it take the reader inside a journey in a cyxlist daily routine. In this story the author fights dehydration as he tries to make to a national park with shortcut directions from �old timers� the setting of this storygreatly affects the cyclist and the pitty the reader feels for him. Half way through the essay, the biker had already traveled roughly @NUM1 miles; that�s extremely crazy. The fact that he is travelling through California deserts in June is even harder to believe. The first time he mentions the setting, he states he is in a ghost town, two sentences after he states that the sun was beating down. At that point he wasn�t really bothered. Another description of his setting that probably affected his ability to peddle was when he states �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� He was already dehydrated and had already traveled so far, the rocky roads probably didn�t help his journey much. The setting basically made the story. If he wouldn�t have been peddling in the desert, it would have just been another trip in his life. The setting makes the reader see what cyclist really go through. 	3	3		3																					
926	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. It does because the road is not in good condition and he has to travel a long distance with the bad weather. This affects him because he might get dehydrated. In conclusion there are many things in the setting that affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
927	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if they weren�t hills and rough roads, he would of been able to get to yosemite park faster and he wouldn�t of ran out of water.	1	1		1																					
928	3	The setting was the main affect on the cyclist. He said it was hot and that he was lost. The cyclist had no clue were he was going and it was hot out side. He seemed very strest and that only made it worse for him. He was thirsty from all riding and the heat so he trys to get water from a water pump. The water that was in it was horable. He called it a �substance� it had a flavor of battery acid. �If he were not lost and if it were cool outside he would have water and he would not be so upset. The setting of a hot and lost place had a huge impact on the cyclist.     	2	2		2																					
929	3	In my opinion the features of the selling affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, when he was talking abut the terair changing from long strat roads to shard winday one and the speed limit changing he said.he was doing a waterdepleting @NUM1 fuier sands like he is having a hard time, or doesn'twnt to go on.	1	1		1																					
930	3	Due to the features in the setting, including the hot summer weather, the cyclist not knowing the area, and the California desert the cyclist is affected. In the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist is travelling through the hot desert in June when he realizes hes running out of water, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�(Kurmaskie). This is affecting the cyclist because hes becoming hot and has a low supply of water. Also the cyclist realizes he should have never taken the direction from the old men and thinks to himself, ��The growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�(Kurmaskie). This quote proves that the heat of the desert is taking a toll on him.	2	2		2																					
931	3	The setting of this story affects the cyclist alot. I think the setting was supposed to be most like a run-down out of dated town which didnt help him when he was lost. The town is out of date and hot. Which bring another problem, the cyclist was dehydrating because he didnt have enough water. He would hilusinate and see things that werent there. He become very tired in the hot sun. So the setttling in this short stories effected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																					
932	3	The feature's of the setting affect the cyclist because the condition's he is in without any water. the cyclist would be fine if he would have had more water for his trip. He ran out of water not to for into  his journey thanks to the heat of the setting he was in. the cyclist makes this statement. I was hitting my water bottle pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June�. The cyclist is saying that since it is so  hot where he is he has to take regular drinks of water so he stays highdrated throughout is trip. It is also saying that in the mountians with less air and how hot it is he is not doing as well as he thought he would on the trip.	1	2		2																					
933	3	The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat smoot terrain, when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. The biker said �I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot. he was sweating and getting dehydrated, �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst.� he had eighteen miles to next town without much water. The first deserted town didn�t have any drinkable water. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going.	2	2		2																					
934	3	The cyclist has to endure ruff treain and bad road condisions and a lack of water is the ??? near did not help the prodlem. Ther was a good prasority he could have heat strock then his hope was stll up by a abonded welches take factry.	1	1		1																					
935	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1� the imagery is what sets the cyclist back. The scorching dessert and plant life gives him a sense of seclusion and scares him. Because the cyclist is in the  dessert he keeps on worrying about his water and heatstroke where as if he where in a rain forest he wouldn�t worry about water or heat. I think he siked himself out just by taking in his sorroundings. If the cyclist would have pictured water all around him and arctic like temperatures I think he wouldn�t have been so worried. What�s interesting about this story is that if he would have gotten himself prepared mentally for the conditions he wouldn�t have struggled so much at the end. �At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back blocking the majority the pavement in front of me.�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). If the cyclist word of concentrated more on the task at hand and less on what was going on around him I think he would of succeeded without as much stress.  	2	3		3																					
936	3	The features  of the setting affect the cyclist in that it made him use up his water supply and tested his determination. � Sometimes life can be so cruel� implies that he was having a horrible time coping with the setting he was in. To himself he thought be was gonna die at any moment.	1	1		1																					
937	3	In the essay �Rough road ahead: do not exeed posted speed limit,� the author is continually depressed, by the features of the landscape he passes. At first he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water, this sight doesn�t bothe him. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a �rusted water pump,� and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path then he passes an abandoned Welch�s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. The setting its features serve to dissappoint depress the cyclist in his quest to find water.	3	2		3																					
938	3	In the story �Rough Road ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� a cyclist is faced with many problems. It�s really hot out, practically a desert and its in June. Just knowing that makes me want some water. Also this cyclist is running short of water and still hasn�t got to the place he needs to be. The roads are hills and bumpy which make it harder for him. Those are the problems this cyclist is faced with.	1	1		1																					
939	3	At First the narrator in Do not Exceed  Posted Speed limit was energetic enthusiastic  about their journey to Yosemite national Park .After getting some helpful advice about a few short cuts the cyclist sets out for adventure .First thing they encounter is ghost town .The gentlemen they a taken advice from had assured them it was booming prosperous town .This set the first wave of doubt through the cyclist mind .Then lack of water began .They were travelling through the high desserts of California in June and slowly running out of water .Flat road was soon replaced by short , rolling hills which only increased the cyclist state deliriousness .After a few more dissapointments the cyclist decides there is no hope and they are going to die .The reader is partly drawn in believing that this is the end for the cyclist .All of the disappointments set the stage for the end of the cyclist and you can�t stop reading because you have to find out what happens.If it weren�t for the hopelessness of the setting you wouldn�t care.	3	2		3																					
940	3	When the cyclist is going on his trip, he is riding through as desert. All he sees the entire journey is a flat rode and dirt. He is riding on the road; hopelssly hoping for some form of lif. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. �The author is trying to be positive but it�s hard, because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert. Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn�t be that worried, there�s water and shade. He has none of that in the desert. This whole journey was all mental. He always kept in his mind that everything would be ok. That is what helped him survive. This is an ispiring story, to anyone who needs a push to stey optionistic.	2	2		2																					
941	3	Poor directions heat, and lack of water affect the cyclist in the story. At the beginning of the story, the cyclist is confident in the directions which would, �slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.�  As the story progresses, the cyclist is no longer so confident. The �heat of the California, June day causes him to be fluent in drinking water.� I had been hitting my water bottle pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� This lack of water is a big problem for the cyclist, so big that he was near heat stroke. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He braved the elements and forced himself on, with hopes that any source of water would reveal itself to him. His perseverance paid off. �Then , as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. The cyclist had found a barst shop and recteved water.	3	3		3																					
942	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. I say this because the setting is in the hot deserts of @LOCATION1. The cyclist is sweaty and tired and has almost no water left. This lack of water makes the cyclist desperate for food and water. The setting has a lot to do with how the cyclist reacts to what happens.  	1	1		1																					
943	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, because there was no one in sight he couldn�t ask for any help or direction. Also, because of all the road conditions it was hard to ride a bike through all the rocky roads and he was very tired and dehydrated so that didn�t help him it just tired him more. Another reason is because of the poisonous snakes if he disturbed them they could harm him. Also, if he would had fallen off his bike a snake could have biten him and then he wouldn�t be able to make it anywhere because of the bite. Those are the features of the setting that affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
944	3	"The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. It affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to trudge over and the lack of water he has. The rolling hills make him tired and weak along with the rough terrain. The lack of water doesn�t help any when he�s thirsty because of the hills. The features affect him mentally because the farther he goes the more dalerious he gets. Each more mile he keeps telling himself, if I can just get there I�ll be fine. He also blames himself for listening to the old men. And with this also came doubt. He was doubting that he could make it alive. In the story it says, �it didn�t really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean"". mentally he couldn�t make it."	2	2		2																					
945	3	When the rider was riding his bike in such day settings has started to need water he was running out, So his whole adventure was to find water. Being thirsty was very hard because it made him not want to keep going because he was so tired. It made him harder on him. But it also got him more strength and because in himself, and keep on pushing. 	1	1		1																					
946	3	�Do not Exceed the posted speed limit� tells a story of learning and determination, as one cyclist bikes through the deserts of California,  encountering obstacles such as snakes and a lack of water along the way.  The descriptive features of the setting greatly affect the protagonist along his journey. The essay takes place in the early summer. As the cyclist prepares to retire for the day, he takes particular note of �the serenity of an early summer evening,� and ends the day feeling calm. The next morning he is excited and rejuvenated, ready to bike again. The heat rises as the day goes on, and by mid-day the cyclist begins to worry about his water supply. He boldly continues forth reaching new terrain, rolling hills. Here he begins to lose hope, and is disappointed when he seem the �town� he hoped to find is an abandoned juice factory. The cyclist thinks he is going to die due to the heat and lack of hydration, but gathers his strength to turn the final bend, and reaches a bait shop where he can stop and get water, he is finally relieved. In conclusion, as the cyclist continues his journey through the California desert, the change in both weather one terrain coincide and affect the cyclist�s change in physical and mental strength to continue traveling.	3	3		3																					
947	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. For example, the story said,""I gathered up a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth"" This quote explains that the setting was very and had pebbles. The setting benefiting him by taking the thrist off his mind. If their wasn't any pebbles by the cyclist he @MONTH1 not have made it. In cocnlusion in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the cyclist was benefited by the features of the setting."	1	1		1																					
948	3	The features of the setting affect. Any cyclist   because with the cyclist passed many time in the bicycle had problem on his/her back  when he/she will be older. When they will be a older person and they had passed many time in the bicycle, they will had a serious problems and also they will can not walk  more.	0	0		0																					
949	3	The setting in the essay �Rough Road ahead; Do not Exceed the speed limit� affected the narrator in many ways. The first thing that affected his ride was the heat. at first he didnt really notice but then it began to slow him down. Then the ways of the roads began to affect his ride, the roads went from flat sheet to short, rolling hills.� The road change and the heat made him say �I could drop from heatstroke.� Then because of the old towns he went through he was unable to get water. The water pumps were so old and unused for so long that the water was of very poor quality.	2	2		2																					
950	3	The complex features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively throughout this story. His trip goes from bad to worse as he progresses to Yosemite. After taking directions from the �old codgers,� the author attempts the shortcut, but is dissapointed. He arrives at the first town but it is completely deserted. He rubbed it off though, and kept �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite,� as his motivation. He pedaled on, but began to run out of water when he arrived at a well, he found the water to be inedible, and continued. Just as if things couldn�t get any worse his trail was getting rougher, and his water supply was low. The cyclist was becoming dehydrated, and began to lose hope. He became even more of a pessimist when �a ridiculously large snake- blocked the majority of the pavement�� He kept going, and excitedly pedaled toward a building, but found it to be abandoned. He even put rocks in his mouth to help his dehydration. When he finally found the fish camp, he was relieved. All the obstacles he prospered through were worth in the end.	2	1		2																					
951	3	The journey of a solo cyclist is a lonely one. The cyclist in �Do not exceed posted speed limit� had a particulaly hard journey, as made even worse by the setting. His main opponent in the battle of staying alive was the heat. In the California deserts as a day in June. It was no surprise that the sun would be heating down particularlly harder than it would at another place anytime. Also, as the terrain became hillier, his journey became even harder. There is nothing hard about biking in a flat straight line. But constantly peadling yourself up steep hills and around winding roads is no picnic. Just like the buildings around him, the cyclist�s water deteriorated as did his state of mind as his trip which started out very joyful became increasingly more mardid. �It didn�t really matter, I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. This cyclist was fighting against strong forces of nature.	2	3		3																					
952	3	"In the short story, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting plays an extremely important role. The story takes place in sunny California, where the cyclist was pedaling around 12 mph. the heat made his dehydration situation much worse.  �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� The cyclist was losing hope, yet he was still determined to find water. This setting was very important to the story, for if it had taken place at @LOCATION1, @LOCATION3, it would not have made sence. The setting contributes to the story by raising the intensity of the situation."	2	2		2																					
953	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind. She didn�t knew where she was and on hip of that got lost. Whether you see nothing around. You or alot around you, you�re going to feel scared. They have the same affect. In the authors case, she was cycling and didn�t/couldn�t and water. This is an over whelming feeling because you can die from dehydration. She then kept cycling and saw nothing. �no one insight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� That is alatining no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die. These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They dffinately affected the cyclist because she was by herself, and on her dvun. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike and an empty water bottle.	3	2		3																					
954	3	The features of this story tend to affect the cyclist very much. Because he took a shortcut he had an even longer journey than before. He was in the middle of no where with barley any water left and on top of all that he�s exhausted from all the hills on the terrien. So because he took a shortcut it ending up costing him in the long run.	1	1		1																					
955	3	The features of the setting in the essay affected he cyclist because first of all he lisined to old fowks that hav�nt left their front porch in about ten years. Then he didn�t ask someone elses apirean on where to go and how to get there. His worsed mistake tough was not trusting the map he had with him the howl time. If he would have just trusted his map and not when with when the old fella said he wouldint have almost died of heat stroke.	2	1		2																					
956	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects him negatively because he was on his bicycle and he was in a hot area and no water whatsoever, like  in this quote, �I  got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance ozzed out.� In the quote, the cyclist finally thinks he has found a water pump but he really gets nothing. Also, another negative thing is that he thought he was never going  to get to where he was going, but in the end , he got there and he got some water.	1	2		2																					
957	3	The setting in the story affects the main character greatly because of the heat. The main charater is biking throug a desert in the summer with little water. The heat of the setting provides a problem because the main character is at risk of dehydration and heatstroke. The main character knows that if he passes out in the barren desert he will sarley die. The main character says, �The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.� The main character is faced with a problem of man versus nature and the heat is winning. Heat and dehydration sap the main characters energy while he is biking through a desert, desperately trying to make it to the next town. In summary, the main characters biggest problem is the heat of the setting.	2	2		2																					
958	3	The setting around the cyclist affected him in one main way. �About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town� (Kurmaskie). The cyclist put the words towns in to parentasis because it was actually a Ghost town. no on lived there, It was abandoned. Around the cyclist was deserts, and more empty towns. The father the cyclist got, the more we realized the old men were wrong as the cyclest was running low on water and there was no where to stop. He finally found some and vowed to never listen to old mens directions again.	2	2		2																					
959	3	All the feature of the area have a have a big affect on the cyclist. It is a hot June morning, and he is on his bike, pedaling hard, going many miles. He can't find any water, because all the towns along the road are deserted. He is getting dehydrated, and losing strerigth. It seems like he might have collapsed it he hadn't thought he was going to @CAPS1, and if he hadn't gotten some water at that store. All in all, the setting seems to have the intention of king him.	2	2		2																					
960	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road:Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit�by Joe kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way.It begins slowly with the �ghost town�.The narrorator �chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,� he wasn�t especially worried,but the fact he checked his water suggests that he�ll need to ration it for a while.The decline continues when he reaches the fock and the �ramshackle shed.�@CAPS1 the description of the place shows you he did not like it,and he confirms that with the words,�this sight was troubling.�He wouldn�t be replenishing his water here.Any more of this he�d be dead,either from dehydration or from pessimism.Eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea.This is ironics,he only going 12 mph to put it in his own words,�sometimes life can be so cruel.�He quite obviously hates the setting,and it�s all the fault of the setting.	3	2		3																					
961	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he had limited water, he had to peddle harder to get up over the hills and he was getting dehydrated from the heat. For example, he had limited water because he had taken the directions from the old men and probably didn�t bring as much as he would have if he would have taken a longer way. Furthermore, to get up the rolling hills he had to peddle faster and harder. That affected him because he would have been more exhausted from peddling. Moreover, it was a June day and in June the days are hot with the lack of a good amount of water the cyclist would have started to get dehydrated. This is how the setting affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
962	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, his body heat raised a good bit. They don�t come out and say it, but they do say, �The sun was beginning to beat down.� We all know that it your out side when it�s hot, you get hot too. It also probably added to his dehydryeon. As a long distance running, I know what the sun will do to you during a hot day. That is how the setting affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
963	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. For one, if the desert was not a deserted mountainous area, in California then the cyclist would not have the same problems. By changing anyone features of the setting you would change how the cyclist would behave in the setting. Thus changing the entire plot of the story. If the cyclist was say in the entry or a mere develop area then he would not face the same dangers as if he were in a mountainous region. The settings features have a huge affect on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
964	3	In the story �Rough Road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting seem negative to the cyclist. The setting seems to start worrying the cyclist two miles after he said that he could make the next @NUM1 miles easily. For example the cyclist says �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, �the cyclist seems worried at that point that things aern�t going to be as easy as they seemed they were going to be. From that point on the setting seemed to get worse for the cyclist later on the cyclist ends up saying �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� That was when the cyclist began to notice his fear of dehydration. The cyclist ended up making it and he realized what a big effect nature can have on you.	2	3		3																					
965	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by unexpected things happening. His water supply got drank quickly and he couldn�t find a town near. He was in the desert-like California, and the sun was beating down on him. When he did one town, it was more of a �ghost town�, and had rusted pumps that had battery-oil tasting liquid. Every person he asked told him is near, but from dehydration, it took him longer. the roads got windy and small hills occurred. There was a large snack in the middle of the road, as the tumble weed blew by. the finally saw a town that had a bait shop and was able to get water and cool down.   	2	2		2																					
966	3	"The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit definitely affected the author. The cyclist states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate  through the ""hills"" as opposed to the ""Flat roads,"" making him more quickly tired. The speaker states, �I could drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a �heatstroke� which could slow him down. The speaker also states,""water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees""(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated. Many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist.

967	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if the old men didnt give the boy advice then he probably wouldnt have run into all the trouble he ran into. At the same time the boy made his way to were he was going. Next time though he will just use his map so he dont have to go through the scare of death again.	1	1		1																					
968	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by the road�s condition being rough as the cyclist rides further along the road.	1	1		1																					
969	3	The setting of this short story has a big affect on the cyclist. Since the story takes place in the desert, the temperature is very hot. The cyclist only packed enough water for the intended trip. Since he made a few wrong turns, he ended up needing more water. There were no signs of civilization so he could not stop any where and buy water. He came to a �run-down� rusty fauret and tried to drink water from it, but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. If this short story had a different setting, then the story would not make much sense. For example, if the story would have taken place in @LOCATION1 he could have just stopped and bought water. The setting is one of the most important elements in a story.	3	3		3																					
970	3	The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble.	1	1		1																					
971	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because It give it more life. More meaning and make I fun to read.	0	0		0																					
972	3	At times when the features of the setting are bad it can have a great impact on the cyclist. For one if it�s too hot the cyclist is going to need plenty of water if he/she does'nt want to be dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat strokes and deadly snakes, cyclist might want to avoid that. When your a cyclist times can be hard just prepared for the long run.	1	1		1																					
973	3	The setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� really goes against the cycilist and his journey. This is because in the places he goes there is no water and if there is it is really hot or bad water. For example, on page @NUM1 it says, �a tarlike substance oozed out, but the water wouldn�t cool down,� This explains how bad the water was when the cycilist was there.	1	1		1																					
974	3	During this essay the author is talking about his journey	1	1		1																					
975	3	The feature of the setting included nice cool pines and than a gost town and it bein hot out and banser of @CAPS1 and posine snacks and hills that where getting harder to go up. When he first started the pines where nice and cool but when he scan the gost town he sot dischriced than it started to set hot and than he seen the snack and thout that it was a dimed baby and was nuvves and than he was carid of dehydration than the hills started to make it harder and harder that is what it was like.	2	2		2																					
976	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he has to use more energy to pedal up hills and through rocky terrain. Therefore he drank more water. When he coudnt.	1	2		2																					
977	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in several ways. The first was the terrain, which started out flat, then turned to hills. The cyclist was growing tired from all the pedaling. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This tired him out faster, since going uphill is harder than riding flat terrain. The heat definitely affected him, because it made him thirsty. He was �travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� This is a very hot time of year, and when a person get lost without conserving water, which he had not done, a person get extremely thirsty. Not to mention the �sandblasted picture of a young boy pourng a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth,� which would remind the body of its thirst. So the setting most definitely affected the cyclist	2	3		3																					
978	3	In the story, the cyclist iS greatly affected by the features of the setting. For example, the setting has no thing for miles. Just ghost towns, makes it imposible to find any water. Also it�s a desert like setting, adding to his thirst. Another example is the hills, that made him even more thirsty. It was June in California so it must have been pretty hot and also the town that he are to had no water because they seemed desorted. Another example is the state he put under his tongue. It�s a trick that lets you survive alot more effectively. Therefore the settings affected his journey and made him wish he didn�t take the old mans advice.	3	2		3																					
979	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was died tried he/she didn�t have anything to drink. The essay stated how would say she/he would save the water til the end. He /she was so tired so the lack of water really affect him/her. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions.	2	2		2																					
980	3	I think that the features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. First, I think the weather conditions affect him. I think this because in the passage it says, �I could drop from heatstroke�. Meaning, its really hot! Also, l think the fact that he has no water left is affecting him because it says in the passage, �l eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�. This has a big affect on him, because he�s very thirsty. Also, l think the fact that there is nothing around him is affecting him. I think this because in the passage it says there were no cars. I think all these things affect him.	2	2		2																					
981	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affects the cyclist. The cyclist takes advice from some old guys and ends up wishing he never did. He is on an empty road, flat and dry. He ends up drinking all of the water he has, and needing to stop for some more.� I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� He stopped to get more water, but once, all that came out was some tar like stuff, and then he couldn�t find another place for quite a white. The flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills and he came to a sigh that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit�, and passed tumble weeds and a large snake. All of these things impacted his journey with fear, caution, etc. When he finally reached a place to get a drink, he was finally satisfied. Because it was hot, and empty, he was more thirsty so therefore the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
982	3	He feels alone there is noune around him to push him, and yet he keeps going trying to push him self to the end to win. The fast roads are rough and the hills are tall but he is a determined to finish.	1	1		1																					
983	3	Heat, abandoned roads, snakes all are reasons that affected the cyclist. The heat made him get dehydrated faster while he was using energy. The long abandoned roads further increased his doubt of living the whole bike ride. He used up allof his water. So when he got to the old pump hot dirty water came out. The snake in the story made the journey for this guy perilous and deadly. This all happened because he listened to the old guys. When the other old guy was about to tell him whereto go he said no.	1	2		2																					
984	3	The features and the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One reason was that he was in the desert. Like in the quote �through high deserts of California. This means that it was hot and he could pass out from a heat stroke. Then he couldn�t even get any water. Like on the quote �of the rusted water pump.� it was describing how old it was then the cyclist got some out but it tasted like old battery acid. Therefore the features and setting afected The cyclist.	2	1		2																					
985	3	The features of the setting intensely effect the cyclist over period of time. Destined to reach yosemite national park from Lodi, California, a determined cyclist rode strongly through the gentle evening strongly. When the setting changed, so did the effect it had on the cyclist. When the man reached the first town, which was deserted, energy began depleting because the sun began to come into the picture. next, he came to a shed desperate for water only to find rusty pumps with tainted, unsafe water. When the flat terrain turned to rolling hills, the man was entirely exhausted�. With what I believed to be my last burst of enery, I manevuered down the hill�. That quote directly describes what the man was feeling and how the hills effected him. When the man stumbled across a fish camp with water, he became reloaded and replerilshed with confidence he had before when he �rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile�	3	2		3																					
986	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he was riding in the desert and all the towns he was going to were abandoned. The month was June a hot month and the sun was beating down on him. And he was cycling with very little water.  	1	1		1																					
987	3	"In the essay �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldn�t hold in the lamest mule.� This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
988	3	The author�s setting described a difficult terrain and harsh weather for bike riding. The author said that it was early summer which means it could be hot and uncomfortable weather for the cyclist. The author also that when the cyclist reached the first town, the sun began to heat down. That means the temperature is going to rise since the sun is getting stronger. Riding a bike in hot weather is very difficult because it takes a lot of effort and makes your body dehydrate faster because the heat makes you sweat which lowers your water retention. Another feature of the setting that the author described was the cyclist�s location. He was traveling through the high deserts of California. This gives you a sense of how much hotter it is since he�s traveling through deserts during early summer while the sun is high. After the first couple town, he starts to ride on short, rolling hills. Hills take a bigger toll on a person�s body because it takes more effort to pedal up a hill.	3	2		3																					
989	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. Fem the ghost town to the bait shop, it was all a challenge for him. A misleading challenge , But a challenge . In the desert is were water grew short and he tried everything to push himself. From staring at the horizon to get to a place to another from sucking on pebble stone to not focus on water. And when he arrive at the bait shop. A sense of relief came to him, like that shop was his safe haven. But yet he would never get directions from any old-timer again. Lack was not a factor in this story. Rather it was drive and overal climate of the story. When it was two �hundred degrees left, and no water left, he pushed himself to the light. And also when he saw a building he was determined to get to it.	2	2		2																					
990	3	The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers so that he could take a short cut. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert. It says in the text �when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid� This shows that he had no water left to kept him dehydrated throughout his travel. Also in the text it says �with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill� this shows that he had no energy left.	2	2		2																					
991	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead ;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie he goes through all kinds of settings where the going could get better or worse. �I noticed the terrain changing, flat roads was replaced with short rolling @NUM1 Kurmaskie). This shows or explains that the going could get a little tougher now because he will have to be riding up hills and he is almost out of water. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� (@NUM2 Kurmaskie). This explains that the man could not get water or a ride from anywhere around, because there was nothing out there to at. This is how the setting features affected the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
992	3	Almost all the features of the settin affect the cyclist. For instence the fact that it is hot causes him to drink a lot of water and need a lot of water. In the story it goes on about how thirsty and sweaty he is. �The water bottles contains only a few tantalizing sips. Wid rings of sweet circled my shirt.� These description suggests that he is very hot since he is sweety and hes been drinking so much. Another feature of the setting is the rolling hills that make him feel like he is never going to reach the next town. �I began breaking the ride down into distress I could make it test for.� He is making the ride seem like a lot of short rides so he could make it.	2	2		2																					
993	3	The setting is described by the author, were very challenging for three reasons, distance, water and the heat. All of these only occurred to multiply the effects of the others. As time had went on, the cyclist grew tired from the heat. In one sentence the effect of the heat were clearly described by the cyclist	1	1		1																					
994	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The scenery makes the cyclist turn worried, unconfident, and in the end an ironic hopeful. The cyclist came upon the first �town�, and described it as only having �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corrall� I believe this is when the cyclist realized the men were a little off, and began to worry: he also couldn�t refill water supply, so fear of dehydration also kicked in already tired, the cyclist became unconfident when he came upon the sign reading, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. Knowing that this was going to be a long and slow journey, the cycles becomes unconfident that he can make it, finally, when passing the sign saying, ""Gary and Wilber's fish camp � If you want bait for the big ones, we�ve your best bet,"" the cyclist reached a hopeful stage, because he knew he had found civilization once again. I believe your atmosphere and surroundings can effect your general mood, and that stands true today with the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
995	3	"The way the features of the setting affect the cyclist is by either making the ride easy for him or tough for him. In the essay it said ""No Town"" but without a town theres no water and water @MONTH1 lead to dehydration. It also says something about flat roads turning into ""short, rolling hills."" This means that the way he had to go was tough and making it hard for the cyclist to stay focused. Those are some examples of the setting affecting the cyclist.  "	2	2		2																					
996	3	The setting affects the cyclist becuse it is the passes is on a road much alot of hills it would affect him as being tired, or if the biter was in a place where the cold or hot it would affect him or his temp. and by his attiude.	1	1		1																					
997	3	The settings in this article effect the cyclist by having to bike a lot of miles to get to the next town. The cyclist has limited amount of water and its very hot out. Theres nothing insight for miles and miles.	1	1		1																					
998	3	The futures of the setting affect the cyclist was that he show the maD to other people and he shouldn�t (ister) to others where he had it to go.	1	1		1																					
999	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� many features of the setting affected the cyclist. And these setting could be easily formed in the middle part of the essay. And these settings caused the cyclist exsaused on his journey. First, the cyclist noticed a rode change from flat to short, rolling hills. He had to spend more energy to go up the hills which caused him to loss a certain amount of  energy. Then, his lack of water caused him a dehydrated state. He could loss an another large amount of energy by this and out of this stage, he mostly needs someone to support him or be on his side, but he was riding alone, there was no one on sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. This might cause his emotion break down to make his energy to loss. Overall, the cyclist suffered a loss of energy on his journey. And was unable to have a supporter to help	2	3		3																					
1000	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it can provide landmarks and directions. For example, the narrator states, �They�d sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the landmarks can provide as landmarks and directions along a journey.	1	1		1																					
1001	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed posted speed limit �the cyclist has some very rough obstacles on his way to Yosemite National park. With his lack of water and diredness he runs into a big snake that he thinks is a diamond black. He easily passes the snake and moves on. Being in the intense heat and with know water he never gives up and knows he can make it to the park safely. The reason why he go's this way is because @NUM1 �old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office�. These guys gave him wrong directions. That really affected the cyclist because all of the other stuff wouldn�t have happened if he payed attention to his surroundings and people around him.	2	2		2																					
1002	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch�s Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water $ be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of liFe or building. Therefore his surrouding throughout the story make him indifferent, confident & relieved.   	3	2		3																					
1003	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the roads are rough, uneven and he has to push out more energy to pedal his bike on rough, uneven roads then on nice, paved, even roads and also he is out of water so there again is using all his energy without any redaveanator.	1	1		1																					
1004	3	The setting affect of a cyclist can be petty complicated. So many things has to be prepared for you to be a successful cyclist. First up have to be prepared for the weather. For example when there is serious weather conditions like rain,snow you have to careful of ley roads.Also they have to be prepared for is long riais. Some naes might be from @NUM1 miles the have to bring plenty of food and water. Also anothe affects that a cyclist has to tase is the condition of the bike. For instance he/she has to make sure the bikes are in good condition and is going cooperate. Also if work need's to be done to the bike then the bike can be worked on.Also another affect of a cyclist is the cyclist is in shape. For instance if the cyclist is in shape he/she is able to ride for a long period of time. Finally another affects is the cyclist has to know where he/she is going. For instance the man in the story didn't know where to go so thats an important keypoint.	1	1		1																					
1005	3	The setting of where cyclsit takes there journey effects the cyclist. The reason I say that is because in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the cyclsit came upon a conflict with the setting. The conflict waas it was very hot and he did not use little things to survive witch he did. These are the reason why I say the setting of where cyclsit takes their journey matters.	1	1		1																					
1006	3	The setting in the short story; �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed speed Limit� greatly affects the cyclist. The rough terrain and blazing sun test him and make him suffer in ways he never imagined. One point, after the cyclist has been going for hours he notes, �Over on long crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� this setting has caused the cyclist to become so dehydrated that he can�t think. The cyclist knows the dangers of the setting around him. As you can see the setting has a very strong affect on the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1007	3	The cyclist was affected by long hours of riding the bike into the areas where he never been.	1	1		1																					
1008	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� The cyclist is affected by the setting mently and physicly. For example the setting affected the cyclist mently because it all was dessert and sand with no water. He thought he was going to die, he said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� If he had some water he would not have thought this. Also the cyclist was affected phyisicly because the road was rough it looked as it could go on forever. He was losing energy and was getting tired from riding up all the hills with little water left in him. It was hot and it seemed hopeless but if he was riding through the evergreen forest I don�t think he would have felt this way. In conclusion the cyclist was effected by the setting phyisicly and mently if he had not been riding in the desert he would not feel this way	2	2		2																					
1009	3	"In the essay, �Rough Road ahead"" the character sees many settings through his ride, all of which affect his mood and physical condition. For example, when the author describes one place he came to as, �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mute greeted me. Thes sight was troubling�, this was the turning point where the cyclist began to worry. He was running out of water, �The sun was beginning to beat down�, and he was probably tired of pedaling. But, to make matters worse, he came to rolling hills. This affected him because he had to work harder and had less water to pick him up. When he finally got to a �modernized� town his spirits were lifted, and he was able to get water to cool him down. This gave him more strength and will-power to continue his trip Yosemite park."	3	2		3																					
1010	3	The setting of the story has a huge affect because it was such a empty terran that made him rely on only himself because of the lack of others to help. For example, if he was riding through a city for hours he could stop and take a break in a store or get water from about any where. But being in the desert it really tested his inner strenght to go on and get to safty.	1	1		1																					
1011	3	In the essay I can conclude that there were many features of the land that affected the cyclist. For example in the text it states �ridiculously large snake�blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� If you are greatly afraid of snakes that could ruin your whole trip. The cyclist was scared but over came the fear and moved on. Also another thing that changed the cyclist was the lack of water. Not having enough water could be bad. As stated �I could drop from heatstore on a gorgeous day in June�� There are many features that effected the cyclist and his journey.	1	1		1																					
1012	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s, �Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� there are several features that effect the cyclist. �..and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie) Deserts in June are extremely hot and dry and caused the cylist to become dehydrated quickly. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The change from flat lands to hills made the ride more strenuous on the cyclist. These conditions directly affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1013	3	The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was riding through the deserts in June. The cyclist barely had water at the end of the stony. A lot of buidings were abandoned, right when he needed water. That is how the setting affected him.	1	1		1																					
1014	3	In the essay rough road ahead the setting does effect the cyclist because he has been pedaling for so long and he is becoming dehydrated �I had been hitting my watter bottles pretty regularly. I was in the @LOCATION1�. Another reason the setting effects him is because he is starting to see mirages �A sandblasted picture of a boy pouring a refreshing glass of grape juice into his mouth could still be seen.	1	1		1																					
1015	3	The features like not enough water not enough sense of direction, effect the cyclist because he needs water to keep on peadiling. He needs maps to know what direction and where he is going. From not enough water he said �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a lost entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and there been sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that pargraph� That site ment that the old man�s sense of directin was out of date. They did not no where any thing was at just there in giant poarch.	1	1		1																					
1016	3	The features of the setting is that it is hot and dry. The way that it affects the cyclist is that he gets very hot and he drinks almost all of his water and he only has about @NUM1 sips left when he gets to the other town. It also effects him because he had an advantage. The advantage that he had was he left before the sun came up. So then he had a time to get cool. Another part of the setting that affects the cyclist is when he gets even some of the hills he gets a little bit of the wind. Also when the cyclist was thirsty he put pebbles into his mouth.	2	2		2																					
1017	3	Setting plays a crucial part in the cyclist�s mood and energy. For example, in a cool @DATE1 day riding gently downhill, the rider is happy and energetic. However, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June is not the best environment for laughs and ease. The cyclist in the story was hot exhausted, and hydrated. He thought, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� Where the cyclist rides can have a huge effect on the cyclist himself.	2	2		2																					
1018	3	The cyclist was riding his bike and was trying to get to rosemite and he had lack of water but he went on any way and he had to go past a snake and got scared.	1	1		1																					
1019	3	All the features of the settings affect his rythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can. Instead of thinking about it. If I was him I would just ride my bike & think about I thing winning!	1	1		1																					
1020	3	To a cyclist, the surrounding setting can either cause triumph or despair. The cyclist was given very old directions. He was given back roads that are abandoned now. These towns had no people in them normally that would not matter, but he �was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� (@NUM1). If there was shade, a breeze, and @NUM2 weather, he would be fine, but he is pedaling a bike in a desert during the summer. A �ghost town� with no good water could have killed him. A cyclist needs to know their surroundings and be prepared for what nature throws at them.	2	2		2																					
1021	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. First of all I think that when the cyclist came across the �ghost town� he felt alone and discouraged. I think he felt like he was never going to find his way and there was no one there to help him. Also the long hilly highway with nothing but desert on either side basically gave him the discouraging feeling that that road was never going to end and there was no way out of what he had started. I think it made him feel trapped and it was so dry that there was no water in sight and it made him feel so much thirstier than he was. Overall I think that it had really physical and psycoligical effects on him. 	2	2		2																					
1022	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist runs into a couple obstacles and they affected him in many ways. In the story the cyclist is riding a bike for miles. �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.... in my dehydrated state.� This quote only lists a few of his problems. He had tumbleweed, a snake and he was dehydrated. He had to stick pebbles in his mouth because he heard that they take away your dehydration. All through out the story he ran into many problems or obstacles but overcame them very well.	2	2		2																					
1023	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. Some of these features include:- the heat, dangerous animals, not a lot of civilization, and the terrain. In the essay, each of these features were spoke of and they all affected the cyclist in a negative way. For example, when the cyclist headed from the intense heat, he needed to find a town. The first �town� he found he described as a �ghost town� It took a while to find another town and he had been hitting [his] water bottles pretty regularly and [he] was travelling through the high deserts of California in June so he was getting really dehydrated and ready to collapse. The flat road [being] replaced by short, rolling hills wasn�t helping either. The terrain really affected the ?? he had to exert in order to keep going, along with being dehydrated the cyclist had to deal with dangerous animals. During his journey �a ridiculously large snake blacked the majority of the ?? �which  ?? him it could have ?? The features of the getting definitely affected the cyclist in many ways	3	2		3																					
1024	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First, the heat made the cyclist overheated. For instance, the weather was sunny in June. Also, the hills made the cyclist very tired. For example, the cyclist was losing energy and had to keep pushing. Lastly, the setting had no places that could have helped the cyclist. For instance, the cyclist had trouble finding a place with water to drink. In conclusion, the setting affected the biker in a very negative way.	2	1		2																					
1025	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in the way that it is so hot that he is quickly be coming dehydrated. Another feature is that all the building seem to be either abandoned or in despair.	1	1		1																					
1026	3	The features of the setting strongly affect the cyclist. Now the setting is in the california desert on a hot day in sane wich caueses the cyclist to drink all of his water wich later malice him dehydrated. The barren desert with no landmarks causes the cyclist to become lost wich is the main problem with the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1027	3	"The setting of this story plays a huge part in the final outcome. The author makes a mention that he is travelling through the high deserts of California in June. This sentence alone tells the reader that it is hot. And not hot by @LOCATION2 standards, where it gets to @NUM1 degrees, maybe, by noon. That means that the day starts at @NUM2. By noon, it's past @NUM3. Also, the author comes to a sign marked ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� @CAPS1 he makes note that he�s only going 12 mph. Before he reaches any sort of civilization, he has already drunken most of his water, his last ""tentalizing sips,"" This is his main problem, his lack of water. He drank most of it in the beginning of his ride, thinking he�d be okay, but he regretted it later on"	2	2		2																					
1028	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was in the middle of almost nowhere dehydrating. There were no signs for resting areas where you can find water fountans around. The cyclist put pebbles in there mouth to try  forget about being thirsty. Her surroundings were bumpy so she swallowed one. She just kept going and her words were �I was going to die.� First the cyclist was in danger of dehydrating, and end her satisfaction. The cyclist made it alive as she saw Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp. Her setting was very clear until then. The cyclist was then relieved and made it alive.	1	1		1																					
1029	3	Because he is dehydrated, the setting makes him worse. He�s biking, in California, in @LOCATION2. It�s not and the sun is probably scorching. The heat plus all the biking he�s doing, is making him even more thirsty and tired.	1	1		1																					
1030	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many was. The cyclist had been riding on the �high deserts of California in June.� The cyclist also saw a �ridiculously large snake.� There was also no signs of civilization for miles.� There was no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The cyclist went through many different obsticales travilng, triying to get to Yosemite. I think the settingS affected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																					
1031	3	Features of the setting affect cyclists greatly. Things like weather, terrain, temperature, altitude can make or break a cyclist. In this essay, the heat and hills on the road challenge the cyclist. He just keeps going through, and eventually he gets to civilization. This lets you know that you can�t mother nature control you.	1	1		1																					
1032	3	The features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. The author is getting worn out and is rapidly running out of water. He �was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. This shows how the setting is causing him to become greatly exhausted.	1	1		1																					
1033	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist tremendously. According to the text, the cyclist was confident he would make the eighteen miles until he passed through the flat round, that was replaced by short rolling hills. He said and I quoted �I toiledon� he sounds like it�s hopeless, that he wasn�t going to make it. As you can see the setting does effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1034	3	The setting of �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of louage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there. �I got down on my hands, and knees, working,the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength. He was so thirst and tired he didn�t know how else to get some water	1	1		1																					
1035	3	"In the setting the young man is faced  by some challenges that make him as an individual a stronger person. For example he was proud of himself he mad himself happy by saying at the end ""yes sir! I own a very good map"". He knows that he got through the heat, dry air, snakes, and a low supplie of water to get to where he was determined to be Yosemite."	1	2		2																					
1036	3	"The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" affects the cyclist because it�s a dry area in California in June. The cyclist really needs water which is the main thing affecting him besides the fact that he�s lost in a ghost town. Therefore, the lack of water and misleading directions are the main features displayed."	1	1		1																					
1037	3	"The feature of the cyclist was very good �it erodding to who he say in paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1�. I would describe it as a fun. It also looks this time was one of his bes time. Here are some examples he is happy, competive, and thin is full. I�m going to explain my examples. First, he looks hoppy becaus in the story he said �the morning with strong legs and smile on my face. the phase can to you how hoppy he felt. My second example was competive, he seems like a competive person, bcouse he is very heathy and lead to to take a ride from the bike. My third example is the way he is becasse he soid ""As easily as sounding  bond, my trouble, thirst and fears were all behind me the part made me feel.  "	1	2		2																					
1038	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed posted speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. We can tell because the author writes �that road was replaced by short, rolling hills� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This tells us that cyclist is hard to ride on the road. The speed limit is also affect the cyclist. When the the speed limit sign is appear, the character feels �life can feel so cruel� (kurmaskie @NUM1). It tells us that character can not do what he is trying to do. The bad road and speed limit sigh effect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1039	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man�s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	1	2		2																					
1040	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, in the beginning of the story it says that, �The sun was beginning to beat down�, the temperature was beginning to rise, but it had not really affected the cyclist because he had plenty of water supply. Next the story says, �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�, California�s temperature is really high and June is one of the hottest months of the year. The temperature was very high and the cyclist did not have much water left. This was affecting the cyclist because he was tired, hot, and getting dehydrated. Finally, at the end of the story the terrains were changing and there had been more hills and a road that was not as smooth as pavement because it was a dirt road and the hills were making the cyclist have to cycle harder to go past making him very tired. Also the temperature was still very high and he did not have barely any water left. By the end of the ride the setting of roads, temperature and the distance of the ride had made the cyclist exguasted and dehydrated. 	2	3		3																					
1041	3	In the short story �Rough road ahead .Do not exceed posted speed limit ,� The cyclist faced many difficulties .These difficulties were the result of the setting .The story takes place in �the high deserts of California in June � .Because the month June is very warm , and the climate of California is usually hot and dry ,the cyclist ran into problems .Not only did this affect the cyclist , but he travelling through the desert .The setting also included several abandoned towns along the way , which contributed to the problem .The cyclistsoon ran out of water , and discovered the towns that lay before him were unoccupied .He had no choice but to continue with his the journey .	2	3		3																					
1042	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist is many different ways. One way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out. Since the cyclist is getting worn out he needs to drink more and more water. Now that he�s drinking more water his running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it. Then when he starts to use less water to conserve it until he gets to the next town he starts to become dehydrated and more tired and he starts to feel weak. Also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired. It also starts to get hotter and he gets thirsty more often. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1043	3	In the poem �Do not exceed speed limit� the setting is described as very rough and dry. The man on the bike says he was running low on water. At one point he says �At some point tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridi culously large shake� This makes the setting sound dry and empty with a harmful snake around. this  man also said about a sign which read �Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� this also made it hard for the man to ride. These are the settings that affected the biker in the story.	1	1		1																					
1044	3	The feature of it is the landscape the characters the plot the end and the begining.     	0	0		0																					
1045	3	The setting in �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted speed limits� affects the mood of the cyclist in that every time the setting changes the mood of the cyclist changes. In the begining of the story the cyclist is riding through the �cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� @CAPS2 this time the cyclist is enjoying his trip and is in a positive mood. As the story goes on �there was no one in sight, not a building, a car, or structure of any land.� At this point in the story the cyclist has exchanged his positive mood for a desperate one as his water begins to run out.	2	2		2																					
1046	3	The setting in the essay �Rough Road Ahead� makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was �traveling through the high desert of California in June� this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal.	2	3		3																					
1047	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn�t so hot, then he wouldn�t of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn�t help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1048	3	The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� affect the author in a big way. The features of the setting are that �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The fact that there was nothing around him, made the author lose hope and trust. After the author saw the old juice factory, he felt like something was happening in his favor. Then he saw that it was abandoned and he lost all hope. He shows his loss of hope again when he talks about how he�s going to die. He shows that he�s lost trust in the old men when he talks about never accepting advice from �old-timers who haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� In conclusion, the features of the directions he was given and lose any hope of surviving.	3	2		3																					
1049	3	At the beginning of the ride, the cyclist is feeling good and strong and the day as well as the journey, is just beginning. The sun begins to beat down on the cyclist but he remains upbeat, still feeling good and barely noticing the heat. When he arrives at an old rusty water pump, he feels disappointed and tastes a liquid that resembles �battery acid.� The terrain begins to feel like more of a hill, which makes the struggle even worse. The cyclist is drinking water more now, and is becoming tired. He comesto a rough road and says, �sometimes life can feel so cruel,� which lets the reader know he is feeling the negative affects of what he presumed to be a nice bike ride, a snake blocks his path and he becomes dehydrated. The cyclist feels refreshment and relief at a sign for a fish camp, and his thirst is replenished when he takes a satisfying gulp of water in the restroom. The water is a feature @NUM1 the setting that refreshes the cyclist, while the hot sun, rough terrain, and unknown area are features that make the cyclist feel lost and tired.	2	2		2																					
1050	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the sand and the intense heat are two big parts of the setting, which make him thirsty. �... followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�. This is a quote that explains the intense heat that the cyclist is feeling. The sun is another big feature that affects him. This is how the setting affects the cylist.	1	1		1																					
1051	3	The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectaculiar and amazing like. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasn�t what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story.	1	1		1																					
1052	3	The setting can affect a cyclist in many ways, if it were hot out, he would be thirsty and sweaty. If there were hills the cyclist would be tired as well as thirsty. The cyclist although thirsty and tired is determined to get through and find a town. The cyclist said� I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine,� By saying this, he knows that he can make it that far as well as determined to do so. With the terrain causing even more trouble for him, would make it more difficult, but he knows that he must overcome his challenging activity but he still keeps a strong spirit with that, he can do just about anything because he has the encouragement he needs.	2	2		2																					
1053	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making his mood change. In the @LOCATION1, where it�s nice, shaded, and cool, he feels fairly good. He�s excited and ready to take on the adventure of a new path. His still in a good mood when he comes to the first town. As he moves on, and his water supply deplets, his mood sinks lower and he becomes more frustrated. In the ironic twist of fate that he finds a Welch�s Grape Juice, Factory, he is about to quit. He is dejected and almost ready to admit defeat. But he forces himself to go on, and when he finally reaches a place with water, his relief is mixed with wariness of the old man sitting on the porch. He will never take after for granted or advice from old men ever again.	2	3		3																					
1054	3	The features of the setting only drain the cyclist's willpower. The things he sees discourage him, for example one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold the larnest, mule greeted me. This sight was troubling .� The desolation begins to wear away his hope of finding a building or town sometimes the things are psychologically damaging,� In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it � had been a Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.� For someone who is quickly running out of water, this this irony could make one lose their resolve to continue. The snake and rolling hills slow him down, and make him use more energy. The heat dehydrates the cyclist even faster. The environment is a hostile one for a cyclist.    	3	2		3																					
1055	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. First the climate affected him the most thats so because he became to hot, drank a lot, and then became dehydrated. So he had no energy because of dehydration. Another one is the built of the road. That�s so because it was rocky bumpy, winding, hills with being dehydrated the road was very tempting to just give up and die. Then the heat got him because there was no shade, no water left, and the sun just beating down on him.	2	2		2																					
1056	3	During the cyclist trail there are many factors that play out to be disadvantages to him/her. There are rough roads, bad water pump, abandoned battling plant, and the long lasting truth that it wasn�t even his path. All of these factors create something new in the cyclist. As the cyclist recover the first town and realizes it is decreased he is initially amused. He then pedals on, but realizes his water is running low. Then , what is originally a sign of hope because another let down. A water pump found just in time, but the water is no longer any determination they reach �rough roads� creating, once again, a more painful journey. Finally, the cyclist sees a building in the distance, but again, deserted. The only goodness as the poor cyclist is when they came along a bait �tar, some sign of civilization that keeps him alive. Hope after hope arises to the end in turmoil upon turmoil. These encounters would cause oneself to become persimistic on even a task, but he sought through. These encounters create an interesting meal. Every time you catch word on hope you become entitled to what could happen next and then feel sorry for the cyclist after having hope on multiple occasions. The steady and salidrising the plot keeps the reader entitled wanting more.	3	3		3																					
1057	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the bad condition roads. The was also hills so they made it harder for the cyclists.	1	1		1																					
1058	3	�There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. This adaodoness makes it hard for the cycleist to frot hope and threes as where to get water. �I could drop from a heat strote in a gorgeous day in June, hes in the desert in @LOCATION1 in June with little water around no one this make's him very desperate since hes adaodoned.	1	2		2																					
1059	3	The main features that affected the cyclist were the ruff terrain and the hot sun. The rough terrain made it harder to pedal and it tired the cyclist out faster. But also helping was the hot sun because it would dehydrate him while he was riding. So between the hard to pedal rough terrain and the dehydratiog hot sun, the cyclist was very affect to the point of exausition.	1	1		1																					
1060	3	The features of the setting in the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit� affect the cyclist. As the cyclist rides to his destination, he encounters obstacles and views his surroundings. The author gives the starting setting in the second paragraph as �a reservoir campground outside of lodi, California an early. Summer evening.� The reader is informed that the temperatures are not in summers in California. This gives the cyclist his main conflict, the lack of water. With temperatures being high, it is easier to become quickly dehydrated. The author stated, �The sun was beginning to beat down and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Also, to cyclist encounters a ridiculously large� snake in the middle of the rode. The reader is aware that there are many conflicts which one can encounter while cycling. There are finally many features of the setting that let the cyclist know where he currently is, and the place where he wants to be most, the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� @CAPS1 the essay, the cyclist is determined to reach Yosemite, and although he faces troubles, he doesn�t give up and is relieved when he finally receives water.	3	3		3																					
1061	3	The features of the desert changed the way the speaker thought about his journey. When the road began the change, the speaker�s determination did too, �Flat road were replaced by short hills�. The terrain began to change and the speaker became doubtful of the old man that that directed him towards the shortcut. �I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listned to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades�. The heat in desert made the speaker thirsty causing him to drink all his water. There was no source of water therefore he decided to suckenc-stone. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst�,. But the bumpy terrain didn�t allow him to do that. He hit a bump and swallowed the stone. The speaker began to panice, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean�. But luckily the author thoughts changed after he found a supply of water, the features did affect the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
1062	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people, and cars on his �shortcut� he was in great doubt of his survival. �I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.� He thought he wouldn�t get any water because there was nothing around him and he thought he would die of dehydration or heatstroke. �And the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke.�	2	2		2																					
1063	3	The setting of the story had affected the bike rider in many way. It was hot when he was riding so he was thirsty. For example, �The sun was beginning to heat down� (pg @NUM1). So the sun is very exhusting and made him to start dehydrating. Another example is a traveling through the desert of California in June� (pg @NUM2). California is a relatively hot state and June is one of it�s warmer months. The terrain didn�t favor in the riders either �Flat road had turned into, short rolling hills �(pg @NUM2). Short rolling hills are harder on a bikers body than flat terrain. This is how the setting affected the rider.	2	2		2																					
1064	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert. Also, the author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was beaming on him.	1	1		1																					
1065	3	In this paragraph I will explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting affect the cyclist in ways such as weather, road structure, & animals. All things that the cyclist could not controll. Therefor affecting the cyclist while he rides through.	1	1		1																					
1066	3	The features of the setting in this story gives the cyclist determination. Since the desert	1	1		1																					
1067	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn�t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn�t in a �ghost town�, with the, �sun beggining to beat down�. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, �about forty miles into the petal�, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot.	2	2		2																					
1068	3	The features of the setting is very important for cyclist. If the setting is wrong they could be in many danger. It is really important to have a clear setting.	1	1		1																					
1069	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist horribly! For example, he ran into the worse problems and couldnt really do anything about them. also, he started out fine, then he started to become dehydrated. He didnt have much water left and he was only @NUM1 miles up the road. a loss of water was very affective in June traveling through a desert. also, the damage of the road was very affective too because hes on a bike and not too good of balance. These features could affect the cyclist in many ways because of the weather, temperature, loss of water, road damages and snakes. the cyclist was on a bike and couldnt really protect himself, and he was dehydrated, and tired. 	2	1		2																					
1070	3	Throughout his journey, the protagonist in the story encounters obstacles in the setting. First off, he is cycling in the hot, dry, desert. There is no civilization or natural water source, so he faces dehydration. Additionally, the terrain he was riding on proved difficult. He encountered rolling hills that took a lot of energy to ride up. There were even signs for �rough road ahead,� @CAPS1 obstacle was a mental obstacle. He came across an abandoned juice factory when he needed an occupied building. These were ironic and mentally frustating. The cyclist must have lost hope in @CAPS2 civilization after he found @NUM1 abandoned examples of civilization. This discouragement must have made his journey more mentally challenging.	3	3		3																					
1071	3	The features in the setting would affect the cyclist because they would want to have towns with water so they can restock they�re water. They would want water even more after going up hills. They would also want a palce to gey something to eat and maybe rest.	1	1		1																					
1072	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because of the heat and had know water. Also how rough the road ahead was. Another problem was the dry air and snakes laying out everywhere in the desert. Also the hills were a big problem to because of the heat and know water. Finally the other problem was he knew he was going to die and the birds would eat at him and their would be nothing left of him. This is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1073	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, �A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didn�t have much to drink until the next town. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills� (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen� (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted.	3	2		3																					
1074	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has water and plenty of it, the setting seems to be smooth, easy riding. This means that he doesn�t have to use much water, but he still uses some because anyone that rides @NUM1 miles on a bike will need plenty of water no matter what the terrain is like. The features of the setting affect the cyclist toward the middle and end of his trip greatly because it gets rough and hilly and so he needs more water that he doesn�t have. And since he was planning on being able to get water at the first stop he didn�t conserve it as well, so this left less water for him to have when he really needed it. He then became dehydrated after his first stop, and he didn�t get any more water there so it caused him to dehydrate. So it seem that the features of the setting affect the cyclist because when he has plenty of water and doesn�t really need it the terrain is smooth and easy to ride but as he drinks his water the terrain gets rougher and worse. So the features of the setting affects him greatly in that they don�t help him they just get worse when he needs it to get better.	3	2		3																					
1075	3	There are many ways that the features affect the cyclist. One is that he is already scared to go up this really big hill. Another is that he is going up this big hill its hot, there snakes, hes scared and tired. Almost all of his energy is gone. He just wants to stop he is determined to go up this hill. He also knows that it cant be that bad because he can just relax al the way back down.	1	1		1																					
1076	3	"After reading, Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� I noticed that the setting of this adventure affected the narrator. First of all, the heat cause the narrator to be uncomfortable and thirstier. While on the moving, he refers to the trip as a ,�water-deplating� one this quote shows that he was lacking water and that this was a major problem. Also it refers to the road as �rolling hills"", and this shows the reader that they seem to go on forever. This lowers the narrator�s hope of getting there quickly. Also the desert gives the author low hope of reaching his destination. The setting affects the narrator both physically and mentally."	2	3		3																					
1077	3	The setting of the story affected the cyclist because it kept him going because he was all alone and had no help. First, just the fact that he was by himself kept his determination high. If he would have had a partner they could have stopped and took a break or shared the water. Next, the fact that there were no buildings, houses or anything in sight affected him.  He got a bolt of strength just from seeing a building ahead. If there had been building he could have stopped and asked for more water and rested. The fact that he was in a desert in California in the middle of June really affected him. He had no determination there because there was nothing he could do to better the situation in his cause. He even at one point felt that he might die. In conclusion the setting really affected the cyclist because it determined his endurance and will power.	2	2		2																					
1078	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways.for example, he ask the older guts, ""that haven't left rheir porches since carter was in the office where the next placewas to get water. Also he was out in the middle of nowhere. It was also in June were the weather was warm,and he didn't have a lot of water."	1	1		1																					
1079	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, he was in �high desert of California in June.� This affected him many ways. It makes him become very dehydrated. He had to conserve his water and chew on pebbles to get any spit to collect in his mouth. Also, the road became very rough. The new terrain made him has to push himself harder and lose energy quicker. The last feature would be the distance. He had to travel a lot further then he had planned to. This again affected his energy and spirits with thoughts of possible death, and not be able to make it. Those are how just some of the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1080	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Since the cyclist was in the middle of no where, he couldn�t get any water. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst,� he was so thirsty that he barely had any energy to keep going, �The growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke,� it was hot out and he had no water so this affected his energy.	1	1		1																					
1081	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist. The harsh turane proved a challenge when his water supply was low and all towns had been abandoned leaving him no refill. The heat was also a factor quickly creating him weary and tired. On the bike ride he had a glimmer of hope at an old water pump but quickly disappointed when the hot liquid tasted of battery acid. The setting set the conflict and helped achive the tone the author was looking for to affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1082	3	The settings effect the cyclist by the roughness of the ride. First, they go over a bunch of rocks, and the tire could poys. Next it could be smooth and easy. Also, it could be far away from towns and difficult to get back. There could be a lack of water making you dehydrate. That is how the setting around the cyclist could effect him.	1	1		1																					
1083	3	The setting desented in the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� would be a nightmare for any biker. This biker is riding in the middle of a desert on a summer�s day. The sweat dropping down him is just speeding up his dehydration. This is shown when the narration states, �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie). This show how hot the desert was, and how he could drop dead. The desert is also deserted with rolling tumbleweeds and giant snakes, as he passed abandoned towns and factories. The dangerousness for a biker in this area is very high. The biker was lucky to have made it out of those sorroundings alive.	2	2		2																					
1084	3	The desert area of California was makeing him dehydrated. The trip was long but he had enough water to get him there only if he took the maps way. The old men thot �haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office� told him a shortcut that he followed and ended up almost killing him due to heat stroke and dehydration. If the cyclist would have followed the map he could have stoped off at a store for more water if the setting was that bad.	1	1		1																					
1085	3	The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , �like a foolish yuuth,� folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He �ans almost dehydrated and �in an ironic twist� he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: �Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we�re your best bet � in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who �haven�t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office�	3	3		3																					
1086	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because first he realized that getting advise from people that no longer drive or even leave of the porch would be unuseful. When the author say �old timers who haven�t lest the confined of them porches since carter was in office� that what he is explaining. He then say �I rode  into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face� he was refering back to how hes  on the rode  alone riding the bike and theres not a car insight any where around. The curbs of the turns where so sharp that only a bicycle could make them as safe as he did �He whipped the sweat from his eyes to make sure it wasn�t mirage and tried not get to excited� @CAPS1 in this situation would have made many people excited about the long lonely cicle by his self.	2	2		2																					
1087	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by making his way to the Yosemite National Park a longer and more difficult and dangerous way to go. He takes the awee of going that way by some old folks that he says �haven�t gotten off there porches since carter was in office.� I think tha tthere would be a reason to not listen to them though they @MONTH1 have wisdom.	1	1		1																					
1088	3	In the setting there are no cars and no buildings meaning no help. The cyclist is tired and dehydrated because he ran out of water. No one was around because it was the desert. The cyclist was dehydrated but kept going to his destination. The road was straight but almost to the end there were many hills. Along with having to bike up the hills he almost ran into a snake. The weather was hot he had no water, he could have died.	2	1		2																					
1089	3	The features in the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affect the biker. For example, the heat is constantly drying the biker out. Also, at the first town the old water pump proved to be a hopeless cause with water tastd like �battery acid�. Even after that were more problems. There was a sign that posted a max speed limit. The biker was doing about one-fifth of that speed. This affects his mood and he realizes that it will be along ride. The pebbles that he found helps him out. He remembers reading that sticking pebbles in your mouth calms your thirst. Finally, the bait store gave him the relief that he needed at the end of his trip. In conclusion, the setting makes the riders journey an  one, but in the end the bait store had just what he needed.	2	2		2																					
1090	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example their was not towns close near. One reason this affected the cyclist is because if the towns were near each other if he ran out of water there would be stores close by. In addition he could have a heatstroke and there would be no one around to get help from and he could easily die. In my point of view of the reading I believe where he was located is what affected him mostly.	1	1		1																					
1091	3	The hot wheather is dehydrating the cyclist, who can�t find more water. The hills are rough terrain is draining the energy he has. The heat is so rough he has to break the road down it to polants he wants to get to. He get drained physically and emotionally. He has a hard journey.	1	1		1																					
1092	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not. On the posts �Do not exceed posted speed limit �is after �wide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�. This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. �a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist.  	2	1		2																					
1093	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist from the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, �by Joe Kurmaskie had many obsticales to over come. When he first showed the old men his map he was probably thinking to himself, �@CAPS1 my gosh, what did I get myself into?!� Because the cyclist trusted the shortcut the old men told him about he had a lot of doubt, anger and determination later on during the day. It was really hot and he was running out of water making him worried he was going to get dehydrated and die because he was starting to think he was getting lost. The hills also affected the cyclist by making him tired. In conclusion, the cyclist, in the end, found a little store by all the determination and effort he put in.	2	2		2																					
1094	3	The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because, he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehygrated it's not healthy and you die from it. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down,along with the sweat. As long as he has some lijid left, it should be ohang. 	1	1		1																					
1095	3	"The setting of this story is a dry, hot desert in the middle of June. These features of the setting, effect the author, because it shows how he starts of strong + determained and his left weak + doubtful. In the begining of the story, the author says, �Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� This is showing the readers confidence he has with himself before starting his trip. Later on in the story, he discribes the setting as �the high deserts of California in June.� He is discribing the heat + what he is facing. It goes on to tell how he is dehydrated in worn out. But he comes to a town, ""cool water drippen from my head as I slumped against the wall."" @CAPS1 he is relieved. As the setting changes, the authors attitude changes as well."	3	3		3																					
1096	3	Different features of the setting affect a cyclist for example,temperatare really changes everything. If it�s too hot, you�re going to get tired really easily. Then again, if its too cold, breathing gets really hard. The biker in the story was in desert area in june, so it was really hot & tiring. Also, the terrain as affects a clyclist. If the road is filled with hills getting up those hills is difficult. If it�s all down hill, it�s really easy, but all uphill is hard, level terrain is fairly easy. The cyclist in the story was in level terain, then it turned into a lot of hills which tired him out. Features of the setting really affect a cyclist	2	1		2																					
1097	3	The setting affects the cyclist because he is faced with roadways he is unsure of the weather is hot and dry and there are wild animals. The text states,	2	2		2																					
1098	3	The setting has a great impact on the condition of the cyclist. First, it is a very hot dry in June. The cyclist is maneuvering his way through �high deserts in @LOCATION1� where he comes across many hills that he must climb over and maneuver his way down. With all of these obstacles and the heat slowing him down he will need water but is already low.	1	1		1																					
1099	3	"In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the narrator is faced with the challenging and perilous desert he must cross. He wasnt traveling in a car, he was riding a bike and crossing a desert on foot is tiring enough let alone on a bike. ""The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water depleting @NUM2. Sometimes life can be so cruel.� In the horrible @NUM3 degree heat the narrator gulps down his water bottles at such a rate that he�s at risk of running out. Not only that but he�s been pedaling for such a long time that he @MONTH1 pass out from exaustion or,.� I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadnt been off their porch in decades.� So I would say the narrator was pretty hasseled by his surroundings. "	3	2		3																					
1100	3	"The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people. When he got into the first town he had ran out of water to drink but the towns water he was in now tasted like battery acid so that�s not safe to drink. As he started to head out the scenery changed. �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore."	2	2		2																					
1101	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because at first he had to watch out for the snakes that usually crossed the roads, then the streets were crooked and bumpy, so the road structure throw him off a bit, and he was riding his bike in June and it was very hot, and he had lack of water so he thought he was going to have a heatstroke. These things affected how the cyclist performed on his bike.	2	1		2																					
1102	3	The cyclist is riding through the high deserts in California. In this environment everything looks the same for miles. The cyclist is dehydrated and is getting worse because he has no protection from the sun. It is hard for the cyclist to keep in good spirits because he is not even coming across any towns or sources of water. The cyclist says �About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town.� This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This made the cyclist doubt the old timers directions. In the wide open desert, the cyclist was only coming across something after at least twenty miles. The heat, lack of water, and lack of civilization made the cyclist think he was �going to die and the birds would pick [him] clean. When the cyclist spots the abandoned Welch�s factory, the cyclist says they used what seemed to be their last bit of energy. The conditions affected the cyclist	3	2		3																					
1103	3	The setting affects the cyclist by showing that he is a little angry. He states that �don�t remember the saying don�t take candy from strangers.� So we know he is upset about something. He is mad about the fact that this one older man tells him directions on how to get somewhere, and it�s wrong. The man figure that out halfway through the story. He also said that �the old man hasn�t been off his porch since Carter was in office,� so he needs to get his directions up to date. So the beginning is a negative attitude.	1	1		1																					
1104	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the settings affected the character because he thought he wouldn�t make it to the park because of the way things looked around him. Because of the rolling hills and snakes he didn�t think he would make it any where and thought he was going to die. That�s how the setting affected the character.	1	1		1																					
1105	3	While the cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park he listen to some old  men who gave him directions for a shortcut.When he began his trip everything was fine.But then he found that along the �shortcut� there was no building.By the time he figured out that the old men were mistake he had almost run out of water.There was nothing around that he could drink.He was getting very thirsty.The fact that he was in the deserts of California in June didn�t make his task any easier.About halfway through his ride he ran into rolling hills, which made his trip even harder.Towards the end he found a building and he used all of his strength to get to it just to find that it was an abandoned juice factory.This made going without water much harder as well as he gazed at the picture of the boy who was drinking juice.In the end he finally make it to a pait shop where he guzzled all the water he possibly could	3	3		3																					
1106	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. For example when he was riding on the road he would pick a destination and ride to it. Then he would take a break. If this destination was a building he would be strong willed and determined. If it looked like their was nothing ahead but hills, he would just ride and wait to fall over dead without a care in the world.	1	1		1																					
1107	3	One ramsackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubled. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. With any luck, I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. Rough road ahead if he didn�t take the old mans advice, he would have enjoyed his bike ride he needed a new map.	3	2		3																					
1108	3	The features in the story affect the cyclist by not having anything to drink. The person was going to a place far away with out any food or water for miles. He could have died. There is anther feature the effects the cyclist, and that is no one is around for miles. If he died out there, no one would no know for days. I know this because in the story he said � There was no one in sight, not a building, car or structure of any kind. ''That says it all, the last feature is that it was hot. I know this because it says ''I was travelling through high deserts of California in June.'' It is hot is June, and it is even hotter in California.	2	2		2																					
1109	3	"People who travel will almost always encounter difficulties. For the main character in this story, thus a very true. His first mistake was when he took directions from the �old-timers� by doing that, he travelled extremely far out of his way. In the story he talked to the old men on the porch. He said, �what I shouldn�t have done was to let them see my map"".  Another problem he faced was when he began to run out of water.  This caused a problem to him because of dehydration. In the story he said, �The water bottle contained any a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, another problem he encountered was the desert area that he was riding through. This caused problem for him because there wasn�t anybody around to help him if he needed it. In the story he says, �There was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind.� By reading this story, we�ve realized that people encounter problems everywhere, however any problem, no matter what size, can be overcomed"	1	1		1																					
1110	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because on page @NUM1 it talk about how the cyclist had to go down a hill then find a factory for juice. Like if the cyclist don�t find any building he would of kept the hill and wasted the little bit of energy for actaire.	1	1		1																					
1111	3	Since the cyclist was really thirsty, the setting was not very appealing considering it was a desert. You could tell she was stressing because she was sweating and having a trouble time trying to pedal.	1	1		1																					
1112	3	The setting effects the cyclist in away that most people can�t tell cycling forty miles on maybe a gallon of water is hard expecialy in California �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was traveling through the high desserts of California in June� The effect on his body would be rather devastating.	1	1		1																					
1113	3	In the story the Features of the setting affects the cyclist is that when he is riding he has very little water. Also he takes advise from old men and he meets up with an @CAPS1 Snake and he goes down an dirt Road he has no water at the time there. The conclusion is that he comes of the dirt Road and @CAPS2 the main Road that he travels. Also he promised to stick to it in the @CAPS3. That is how you should stick things at in the future.	1	1		1																					
1114	3	The biker has many features in his story. For example he has discriptive words that put pictures into my head. For example �One long, crippling hill� I can picture it in my head. �There was no one in sight.� All of these parts of the story put pictures in my head. Thats a good thing, for example you want the reader to understand it, and by having discribing words help.	1	1		1																					
1115	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way is that the �rolling hills� @MONTH1 let the rider get more tired. Another way is that of water from severe heat. And finally the path you take along the way and how many stops you make along the way. The heat, lack of water, rolling hills, and the advice you get can result badly by affecting the outcome. A rider should make a plan and use determination to get to where they need to go.	2	2		2																					
1116	3	The setting in the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� reflect upon the cyclist. In the story a cyclist is riding his bike and takes directions from some old men. Later he realizes the old men probably had no idea that things change overtime. He says �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left their porches since carter was in office.�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist takes the old-timers �shortcut� and it takes forever to reach his destination. At the end he reaches his campsite and another person askes him for directions. This time the cyclist says �Yes, sir! I own a very good map,� and �I�d always stick to it in the future.� The cyclist�s message is to follow a map, something you know is right, not a person that @MONTH1 be lying or irresponsible.	2	2		2																					
1117	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated and hot. He was in deserts on a bicycle with his water support running low and rough road with plenty of hills to make it hard for a bike to out come. he kept going though the heat was outrageous and dehydration beginning to overcome him.	2	1		2																					
1118	3	I think the boy should ask you directions for the place were he is going. He can reach the place without water but that is not a good thing to do.	2	2		2																					
1119	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist�s mood throughout the essay. Joe @CAPS1 starts with being happy and confident to determined yet help helpless and then to relief. Joe writes, �Things began well enough� flat roads�� This quote suggests that in the beginning, everything was okay. He started out with a �smile on the face.� (@NUM1) @CAPS2, things start to change @CAPS1 hits changing terrain. He writes, ��I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� This quote states the changing terrain. He starts to lose water to keep him going, yet he pushes himself to the next �town�. Finally, when the author reaches �Gary & Wilber�s fish camp� he is relived when he sees an old guy sitting. The two men say, �know The best way to get There? �Yes sir! I own a very good map.� This reveals that Joe didn t ask for more directions which was his first mistake. In addition, changes in setting can chang a persons mood and attitude.	2	2		2																					
1120	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is in the desert it is in the summer. It affect the cyclist because he is riding a bike. For exsempl in the story he is running out of water. He is starting to git dehyjradid.	1	1		1																					
1121	3	The setting affected the cyclist because of the mood and how everychange happened. For instance when the setting changed the cyclist felt different and it really affected him. Like if the setting was all sunny in a nice town then he would feel good but if he was in a dark town he wouldn�t feel very happy. So the setting really affected him.	1	1		1																					
1122	3	After sometime into his trip he mentioned �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I believe that this setting had gotten him determined to keep on pedaling so he could live. But then he started to think he might die, but he wasnt sad or upset, he was happy. He had sort of chuckled to himself, because of the fact that he might die because he listend to some old men. In my opinion I think he was having the time of his life peddeling through this setting of California.	1	1		1																					
1123	3	Where cyclist was gave him more disadvantages, then advantages. The advantages were their were hills to go down. Disadvantages hills to go up, water running out when he is in the middle of no where, very hot out, and is lost in the desert, doesn�t have much hope until he see's the factory. Biggest disadvantage is he is on a bike, and not in a car. So he has no @CAPS1 and has to pedel to keep going. But being in the desert on a bike with no water, and you are last, is quite bad. He is very lucky that he made it up the hill or else he would�ve died out there. And he thought he was seeing things good thing he checked it out. I think for future refrence ride in a car, don�t use a bike in the desert, its not to smart.	1	2		2																					
1124	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because when all the cyclist is worried about is finding a place with water all he�s doing is getting scared and panicing. In other words, when he�s looking around, the setting he sees is like desert and no buildings. The story says, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� when he sees that he panics and thinks he�s not gonna make it which affects him mentally.	1	1		1																					
1125	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in different ways The woman who had listen to the older men to get where she was going had made her run out water and almost died of thirst. As she was going to this place she had seen a snake �At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake it really did look like a diamondback� (@NUM1). She started to see things that wasn�t there.	1	1		1																					
1126	3	"He was affected by lack of water, the hills, snake in the way and the condition of the road.� The water bottles contained only a  few tantalizing sips. � This quote explains how the lack of water was a problem. The hills affected him by they were �crippling"". The snake it was long ways on the road and he didn�t know how to get passed it . Finally the   roads were rough and you should go  over the speed limit of 55 mph. So he was affect in a lot of different ways not just one."	2	1		2																					
1127	3	"The features of the barren desert path make the cyclist quite nervous, but they also make him determined to escape them. He passes �ghost towns,� �abandoned buildings,� and diamondback snakes. These are images traditionally associated with being lost in the deserts, and would be enough to instill fear in most anyone travelling alone. The author even remarks that sadists are probably finding his story pleasing. He often mentions fears of �dropping� dead, being eaten by vultures, and, at one point, even wishing death upon himself via choking albeit jokingly. And yet he was determined to live. In spite of the odds stacked against him, he moved on, even after losing �what (he) believed to be (his) lost burst energy."" He even maintains a sense of humor throughout, writing of a diary entry that would be left behind that remarks on the wisdom of old men. In the end, when he finds a place to rest, he turns it all into a lesson he�ll surely abide by: follow the map!"	3	3		3																					
1128	3	The cyclist is affected by the heat, the hills, and the lack of people. For example, the cyclist was growing short on water and had �wide rings of dried sweat on his on shirt,� and he could �drop from heatstroke.� The hills must have forced him to use more energy, and lasely  the land of people. If the towns still had people the cyclist wouldn�t have been as affected by the setting.	1	1		1																					
1129	3	Features of any setting affect what you do and how you do it. Features affect the cyclist by water, help, and saftey. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing what spit you have to circulate.� This quote so his desperate need for water by saying he sucks a on rock to drink his own spit. The rough terrain and abandoned road the old men sent him on that was out of date, made him unable to ask for directions, and to even know if he is travelling correctly. Along the road he meets a snake. Being so far away from civilization, if he was to have gotten bit then he would have no one to help save him from dyeing on the side of the road. Also, if he was to have a heatstroke he has no water and no help. Safty, help, and water are all factors which contribute to the features, and how they effect the cyclist.   	1	1		1																					
1130	3	The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard. It has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy. Also, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry. This makes the author need more water than he normally would. The author said ��I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without water, he said ��I could drop from heatstroke�� If the setting had been cooler there would not be so much danger.	2	2		2																					
1131	3	The cyclist�s features around him affected him negatively. He was cycling through �the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). His water bottle was slowly running outand the only town he came to that had water had water that tasted like batteryacid. Events seemed pretty bad, until the speaker became elated when they saw a @ORGANIZATION1 factory. The author was thirsty and the side of the building had �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The building was abandoned. The speaker then states �Somehow  I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope� (Kurmaskie @NUM3). He lost hope after that landscape, and he pretty much gave up. The landscape or features affected the author very negatively due to the lack of water.    	3	3		3																					
1132	3	The setting affects the cyclist because there were lots of hills and very little water.	1	1		1																					
1133	3	The cyclist in the story rough road ahead Do not exeed posted speed limit, by Joe kurmashie, is heavily affected by the features of the setting in the story. First is the �shorecay� that is suggested to get    to @CAPS1, which naturally just ends up separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water. His water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die. In the story, he says: �It really didn�t matter. I was going to die and the lards would pick me clean.� This shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless.	2	2		2																					
1134	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie. One feature that affected the character was the heat of the sun. The narration states� The sun was beginning to beat down� (@CAPS1).	1	1		1																					
1135	3	"The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist in the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. In the story it says, ""I was traveling through the high desert of California in June."" This is telling the reader that the weather was hot and you need a lot of water here to survive, especially if you are riding a bike or working. Later on in the story it says, ""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" This quote gives the reader information and tells us that the cyclist is having a hard time surviving through the harsh features of the setting through the harsh features of the setting. In California deserts I know from prior knowledge it is hot and dry, exspecially in the summer. If you are working outside, like the cyclist in this story is, and you do not have water to drink, you will get dehydrated which eventually leads to death. The author does a good job showing the readers how the setting affects the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
1136	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One thing is the water. There is little water and it is boiling hot. He took some taste of it. He said �It tasted like battery acide.� To me if the water is hot don�t taste it. Another thing is the land. The land went from straight to hilly. That started slowing him down. Last, is the day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking. He wanted to get as far as he could.	3	2		3																					
1137	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist when he got tired very easily because he was biking in the desert in June. There are no rivers in the that desert so he couldn�t get water. It is so hot out there that he couldn�t see very well because of all the sweat that went into his eyes. Also there are no people out there because of how hot it is.	1	1		1																					
1138	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit � the setting affected the cyclist. The setting affected the cyclist mentally and physically, when the setting was nice he had a positive outlook and was full of energy. Later in the essay, as the setting grew less appealing, and more treaterous, the cyclist grew weary and distressed.	1	1		1																					
1139	3	A cyclist always has to face many problems such as the weather, the condition of the road, etc.	1	1		1																					
1140	3	The features in the setting, affected the cyclist in many ways. The first way the features in the setting affected the cyclist is that the whole trail was desearted leaving him alone with no water. In the story it says �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time � say, before the last world war � but on that morning it fit the traditional defination of a ghost town, �this explains that he was alone and that the first town he visited was deserted. The next example of how the features and the settings	2	3		3																					
1141	3	The featers of the setting afected the cyclist by the lack of water made him tiered and a bit deloshional. The lack of shade increased the rate of dehidrashion. The rough road made it hard to balinc. And the snack slowed him dowen. He thought that he was going to die.	1	2		2																					
1142	3	"The setting of the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" is very important to the events that occured in the  story. For example the story was set on a  highway set at @NUM1 which the cyclist was only able to do @NUM2. This is signifigant to the events of the story because since he was doing @NUM2, which by the away is a lot for a cyclist and it led to almost dehydration. Plus it was hilly. This led to the excution of the cyclist, so one could see that setting is very important to the outcome of the story."	2	2		2																					
1143	3	The setting is in a California which isn�t really the coolest of places to be.[temperature]	1	1		1																					
1144	3	"At the beginning of his journey, the cyclist is relaxed and the features of his environment. He says, �I enjoyed the seranety of an early- summer evening.� At a campground in @LOCATION1, the setting is calming and relaxing. At the first town, the setting is shocking, but humorous to the cyclist and he starts to get nervous. After looking around he says. �this sight was trowoling�. The cyclist tip gets worse when he reads for the next town. �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This part of his journey affects him the most. His environment and the features of the land have made him tired and thirsty. The setting has a major role for a cyclist."	2	3		3																					
1145	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead; Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the setting is integral to how the cyclist feels and behaves. The cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively move bleak. In the beginning of the trip, the cyclist encounters a ghost town. ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" The cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is ""troubling."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic. Farther down the road, the terrain of the road changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name."" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting @NUM1. Sometimes life�s can feel so cruel."" The cyclist�s surroundings get progressively worse as he rides on, but even tually he finds a place with working water. He is so overjoyed by this building that he wants to find the owners, and kiss them."	3	3		3																					
1146	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist is he is riding a bike through the dessert. He says �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� So he was scortching hot peddling a bike. The road became bumpy and curry. A sign had said �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted Speed limit. The speed limit was @NUM1 and he was going @NUM2 so it must have been hard to get over all the bumps. The lastly he comes across and poisioness snake blocked the majority of the pavement infront of me.� So him dehydrated trying to get ground a snake would be terrifying. So on his @CAPS1 the setting doesn�t help him much.  	3	2		3																					
1147	3	The cyclist ran into many issues in his/her travel to @LOCATION1. They had to dismiss many hardships such as lack of water, being lost, immense desert heat, plus minor things like snakes and road conditions. The setting of the California desert in June was the most intense hardship. That and the lack of water. Though the heat starting powing at the cyclists� brain by making them see mirages, etc. The heat and entire setting made the cyclists� travel much harder.	2	1		2																					
1148	3	The setting affect the cyclist because in the hot heat of California in June which nobody wants to be outside. But first, was the heat which took a lot out of his body while trying to keep it cool. Then came the factor of which he had very little water when he reached the first town and in the story it said, �A tar like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� So now he has no cool water to drink when he says, �Not two miles into the next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� So the cyclist has very little water is not having to endoor the hardest part of the ride. Then later on he makes a mention to change a paragraph if he loss consciousness. Also he talked about him might getting a heatstroke. Hinting to the fact that the setting he was in was affecting him in many different ways.	1	2		2																					
1149	3	"The setting of the essay �Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" is very dry, sandy, hot, and deserted. On his way to Yosemite he takes a �short cut"" from so he do me through the desert. When he first leaves its in a hot and flat part of the desert. His mood is high and her has confidence. �Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile of my face.� With this he arrives at the first �town� but hes wasn�t worried he had bad plenty of water he moves on. The terrain starts working against him in his search for water, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills a large high way sign jumped out at he. It read: Rough Road Ahead : Do not Exceed posted speed limit.� This lowers his confidence, especially because everything is deserted and if he has a heat stroke no one would he around to find him. He keeps up his determination we he sees the factory yet he moves on. When he see the first comp he is overwhelmed  with relief and the terrain flattens out again. When asked if he need direction he say he has his own map so he can keep stick to the terrain he knows is rest. He can keep his hopes for himself and follow a true set of directions."	3	3		3																					
1150	3	Anyone who has ever rode a bike knows how relaxing it can truly be, but when you are forced to ride miles and miles on @CAPS3 terrain without any water, relaxation feels like an oasis, @CAPS1 through beat-up roads with dryness all around you really puts a domper on your experience, @CAPS2  it extends your need for thirst by enhancing the amount of dryness in the air and the amount of energy you are having. The ability to block all of that out and trying to focus on something easier to handle is exactly what you want to do in these situations, @CAPS3 terrain can really build character into a cyclist, but  adding the fact the amount of water he had and the dryness around him, it sounds like torture. I can only hope that if I ever become a cyclist, I never have to endure this kind of situation.	3	3		3																					
1151	3	The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite @ORGANIZATION1�l Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it wouldve made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle @MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn�t. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn�t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It�s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it. 	2	3		3																					
1152	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways For example, the fact that he is pedaling a bike �through the high deserts of California in June, make the intensity level of the story very high. If it would have been @DATE1 and there was a nice breeze it would be different.	1	1		1																					
1153	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1154	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that if it�s hot and your riding a long way you need a lot of water so you don�t  dehydrated. Also it can affect your vision cause you looking at the sun. Another way cyclist can get affected by the setting is because what if the road is all bumpy and just not in good shape it can affect the way they ride there bike.	1	1		1																					
1155	3	 The story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1 had some statements that we were kind of pointless to put in. One of sentence in the essay had a couple word that don�t need to be used. In the sentence, about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first �town,� I don�t think �into the pedal needs to be in there because its not describing anything.	1	1		1																					
1156	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is, the setting. The cyclist is out in the dessert, in two-hundred degree weather. With very little water. Also, the cyclist didn`t have a map and he asked someone that hasn`t let their porch since carter was in office. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn`t been off their porch in decades.'' This quote talks about how the setting (@NUM1 degree weather, dessert) can @CAPS1 him. Also, he listened to someone that didn`t know what they were talking about. In conclusion that is how the features of setting affected the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
1157	3	The settings of the story is very desert like what I mean by that is its the desert and its hot and he really had to push his self to make it. The condition at the rode are very rough and has a lotof shape turn it in. Apart in the story he gets a boost of energy and pedal as hard as he can down a hill and then relaxes. This is the setting and is summary of the story.	0	0		0																					
1158	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the condition of his surrounding it was hot so he got dehydrated more and needed more water. There were a lot of hills so he had to pedal harder and use more energy to get up the hills. There were no cars, building, smog, just nature. It was peaceful and relaxful ride on the bike thats the setting affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1159	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June.Their is also a lack of water, some must pace his sips carefully. Therefore also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life.  The dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist. His journey does teach you though, that trough determination you will be rewarded. You have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to get success.	3	3		3																					
1160	3	The features and settings affected the cyclist because of all the dangers of doing it. He took advice from old people to do it. But even though it started out good almost nothing last forever. Hes riding a like in the middle of summer with little water and in the desert. He runs into towns that are abandon and the next town is only @NUM1 miles are litheraly going to be rough roads ahead. But when he did get to the town that was abandon to. until he found hope and seeing a man in a chair 	2	2		2																					
1161	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not being in town. I say this Because the cyclist talks about �old timeres who haven't left the contines of their porches since carter was in office."" So that means he dousen't know were he's at."	1	1		1																					
1162	3	In the cyclists journey to Yosemite, several factors hinder him from reaching it. The first is obviously the false information given to him by the elders. The second is that because the information wasn�t true, the cyclist had an insufficient amount of water. This made him dehydrated. The last is the fact that the route given to him included obstacles such as snakes, rocky roads, and old ghost towns and abandoned buildings which made the cyclist less confident. Those are the features of the setting which affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1163	3	The setting affects the cyclist because one he should have stack to his own map. He should have packed an extra bottle of water. @NUM1 not take any advice from people that haven�t left the porch in years.	2	1		2																					
1164	3	The setting affects the cyclist mood in the story the cyclist takes a short cut with many abandon towns, and buildings as well as a bumpy, terrain. When he came to a fork in his path that had a water pump he immediately began to pump it the water was not good for drinking. He was determined to make it to the next town. �I could make that� he said. Because of the ghost town and the old pump he had to continue on. When the cyclist came to a sign in the road warning him about the road a hed he began to get depressed, �I was sad�. Finally when he reached @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 Fish Camp he was thankful and wanted to show his gratitude. The setting can affect a cyclist by his mood at first the cyclist is determined but as the setting gets worse his mood and hopes go down the drain. At the end when the setting is bright so is his mood.	2	3		3																					
1165	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclists because he was thirsty and it was hot and he was almost out of water and he almost died because when he was drinking the water and he hit a bump and spit got lodged in his throat and tiring hills it seemed to never end.	1	1		1																					
1166	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he wasnt pre pared in the beginning, the cyclist got directions from an old man who hadnt left his porch in years so he wouldnt know what had changed. Then the cyclist starts his journey with not a lot of water. When he got to the second town �I notice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� This quote means that he wasn�t expecting hills, he thought it was going o be a flat way. Also in the @NUM1 degree whether with limited water supply, he couldnt ride up and down hills. Going down the hills gave him a break. Thats how the cyclist was affected by the settings features.	2	1		2																					
1167	3	Alot of factors effected the cyclist. Temperature, terrain, directions all gave the cyclist doubt. The temperature through the high deserts of california left the cyclist feeling hot, parched and irratable. Through the story, he had all but a few slips of his water left. Knowing your running low of water �to feel sorry for himself� The cyclist had biked so far the terrain started to change from flat to �rolling hills�. This could impact someone greatly who has never biked on different levals before. Lastly, the feeling of hoped could have effected him the most. Not believing in yourself is the hardest thing to overcome. Having just liesurly taken instructions by an old man cost the cyclist hours of torture. The author did a great job using hyperbole to exagerate the cyclists feeling of lost hope . He also used very detailed text to paint the reader a picture. These literay elements made it easier for me to understand the effect of the temp, terrain and hope had on the biclist.	3	2		3																					
1168	3	The features of the setting really affect the cyclist. He is led into false pretenses by the immediate surroundings. Little does he know that it would bring him into danger? When he comes to a rock in the road and finds that the water pumps are not good he is in serious danger. In the reading it says �The sun was beginning to heat down, but it hardly noticed. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them.� The setting let the cyclists mind wonder so much that he didn�t even realize the heat.	1	1		1																					
1169	3	In the short story, �Do Not Exceed Posted speed limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, expresses the features of the setting like the lack of water, and can not find help to the end affects the cyclist in the story. During his time of need the cyclist says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise old men their wisdom.� The cyclist has a lack of necessities in the features around him and is letting his pride fall down; giving up on hope. When the cyclist finds hope, �And drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait.� The cyclist was astonished of what he had stumbled onto and appreciated that he was still alive. The cyclist should not have taken the old peoples advice for granted, but will now look onto people�s sense of directions.	3	3		3																					
1170	3	Setting affects many things in stories. The setting in this story affected the cyclist. The setting was very hot and it slowed him do wn a lot. For example he said he was doing 55 miles	1	1		1																					
1171	3	The setting in the story was the �high deserts of California in June.� At first the cyclist had seemed really confident and excited about his journey. It was during it that had changed his mind. The cyclist was running low on his water supply's so he stops and pumps water from this water pump but all he gets is this acid taste. So he is on his way to the nearest town which is @NUM1 miles away and he thinks he can make it. So he is heading towards the nearest town when the terrain starts changing. It changes from flat road to short rolling hills. During this time the cyclist starts loosing hope. He thinks that he is going to die of dehydration and the birds are going to pick him apart. Then when he thought he couldn�t make it he saw a sign that said �Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp� He ran into the shop and took long drinks from the sink in the bathroom and when he went out of the store an older gentle men asked him if he needed help and he said no I have a really good map. The thot temperature and rolling hills have a negative effect on the cyclist. I mean he goes from being confident to thinking he is seeing mirages and dieing. It states in the story �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� and �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean� So this brought self doubting behavior. 	3	3		3																					
1172	3	The features of the setting of were the cyclist are affect them very drastically. They need a water supply and if they don�t have one they might dehydrate or even die. They need shade trees because it keeps the sun from beaming down on them so hard. They also need to cycle when its not as hot outside so that just incase there water gets low there is a better chance of survival. It would be great if there was someone with you to help if you get hurt. There should be buildings near by just incase of an emergency. It might even be good to carry a cell phone.	1	1		1																					
1173	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in more than one way. The first features were a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule. These items gave the cyclist a feeling of doubts. They made him begin to think he had taken the wrong route when he saw these things were outdated. Then, he couldn�t get any cold,clean water out of the pumps to save his life. This was the first obstacle which affected him. The next features of the setting which caused a problem were the tumbleweeds and ""a ridiculously large snake.� They made the cyclist scared and caused him to go around these things. You can tell he wass scared because he quoted �I eased past.� When the flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills, the cyclist�s journey became exhausting,never ending, and difficult. Two more things affected the cyclist. These two things consist of the signs. One of which read �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" and the other �GARY AND WILBER'S FISH-IF you want bait for the big ones, we�re your BEST BET.""The first sign affected him in a negative way and caused him to become a little angry and frustrated because he was tired and dehydrated and the rough road ahead gave him no hope. The second sign led him to water which was the one thing that would make things better so it had a positive affect. These are features that had an affect on the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1174	3	"The setting affected the cyclist: due to the changes in terrain. A rough spot for the cyclist was when the terrain changed from a flat stretch to rolling hills. The author wrote, �I tolld on""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was pushing through the rough and it was not an easy stretch to get through. Another place in the cyclist's trip that was difficult was when he saw the abandoned juice factory. The narration states, �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view""(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The context clues that provide information that it wasn't easy are the words ""long"" and ""crippling."" @CAPS1 of those words provide feelings of being drug on through the rough setting of the cyclist's trip."	3	3		3																					
1175	3	The cyclist had experienced some hard obstacles on his ride to Yosemite. He had gotten directions from a group of old men who haden�t gone the places they told him about in a long time. Where they said there would be a town it was more like a ghost town. The day that the cyclist was riding was very hot and he was riding through the desert, @CAPS1 made it worse. Because of the heat he was drinking his water regularly to stay hydrated. This meant he was running out of it fast since the old men had given him directions through places that were no longer open he couldn�t get more water. The cyclist also had to go over roads that were in bad condition @CAPS1 slowed him down even more. Those features at the setting affected the cyclist a lot on his trip.	2	3		3																					
1176	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. In the beginning, he cannot get water and becomes dehydrated, then, he goes on a rough ride and loses more energy. Then he finds the bait and gets water. All of these greatly affect the cyclists condition.	1	1		1																					
1177	3	The setting of the cyclist�s journey effected him because if he was a tot desert in california. This effected him because he had to ride a bike throug it and he heat took a lot out of him. He didn�t have a lot of water because there were no rivers or water supply because of the desert surrounding him. At the end he finds a store which affects him because he gets a cool drink and same supplies which helped him. So in the end his surroundings destroyed him and then relieved him.	2	2		2																					
1178	3	"The bicyclist was riding to Yosemite National Park and on the way ran out of water. ""The wate bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� Then, hills came into play which makes you more tired and thirsty. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� The rider didn�t think he would live �I was going to die and the birds would pick he clean� but he found a place to get water �drank deeply from the sink� and finished his ride."	2	2		2																					
1179	3	In the story �Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting affected the cyclist a lot. At first, when the cyclist set off in the morning, the conditions were great. It was breezy with shade from trees and rivers. Then, after a few hours, the cyclist was in the desert with bumpy hills. In the story, the speaker states, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The condition of the roads and not having water really affected the cyclist. It took more energy to get up and down the hills without any shade which ment that he needed more water which he didn�t have any. The condition of the setting really affect the cyclist and if it was easier to bike, they might have not be so dehydrated.	3	3		3																					
1180	3	The features of the setting was affect the cyclist by disturb them to ride in road, limite their speed, and make their distance longer than the original travel plan. For example, the features at the setting was disturb the cyclist to ride in road because it tells them where they can go and where they can�t and they shouldn�t do this or that such as the sign of �no entering� or �one way�. Second, it�s limite their speed because if the features of the setting it said the limited speed is @NUM1, the cyclist only can ride about @NUM1 and go no more further which can make the cyclist longer time to reach the place that they want to go and couldn�t travel faster. Third, it make their distance longer than the original travel plan or exit or how fast they can rode. Such as the sign of �Rough road ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit�. Therefore, the features of the setting was affect the cyclist during the journal.  	1	1		1																					
1181	3	 The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they doubt or lessen his chances for survival, but the cyclist is determined so he survives.	3	2		3																					
1182	3	"In the essay, the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature that affects him is his lack of water:"" The water bottles contained only a few tantallizing sips. The lack of water made him very desperate, especially when he came to the welch�s grape juice factory. The  building-abandoned years earlier-had been a welch�s grape juice factory and bottling plant."" This despersion, after he had come to the abondoned factory, was followed by dissapointment and a vague sense of hopelessness expressed by the phrase, ""I hung my head"" after he had found the abondoned factory. These are some of the features of the setting that affect the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1183	3	No water, rough terran, bad info-all are reasons why the boy isn�t doing so well I said no water because he is dehidrated but needs to soae his water. Also he could die from heat exauston. I also said rough terrain because he could fall and get hurt with no one around to help. And to top it off he took info from old people that didn�t know what they were talking about. Theas leave all examples about the essay that support my writing.	2	2		2																					
1184	3	In the story by Joe Kurmaskie it tells about a cyclists challenge through the heated deserts of California in June. The cyclist had started out with confidence, followed by determination, then relief. The setting affected the cyclist physically and mentally. First, listening to the old men was stupid, then taking the trip not certain if you would have enough water, and lastly traveling through the desert in June. He started getting a little doubtful with himself as well, that won�t help much with bringing success of the trip. Once he had made it to a fish camp an old man even older then the men who gave him the false information told him he knew how to get to Yosemite, but the young man did the best thing and told him he already knew how to get there. He didn�t need to be traveling out in the desert heat for hours that�s just unhealthy	2	2		2																					
1185	3	A cyclist is affected by many things when riding, most being features of the setting. One feature of the setting that can have an affect is the terrain. If the terrain is rough then the cyclist could have a more difficult time maintaining control of the bike, especially if he is not a professional rider. For example, the author of the essay on page @NUM1 titled: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit, had a hard times on the rougher roads partly due to his level of experience. Another aspect of the environment that can have an affect on a cyclist is the climate. Most people who go cycling ??? know anything about the sport know how to dress for it to keep their body at a comfortable temperature but sometimes the weather plays tricks  on us. The cyclist could get caught in a sudden heat wave to drop in temperature.	3	2		3																					
1186	3	The features of the setting inhance the cyclist�s desparate spirit. Throughout the whole journey the cyclist is by himself and there are no people, cars, or buildings around. This made him much more desparate because if he would fall of dehydration there would be no one to help him and he would just die. Also, he came upon things such as �Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant� which got his hopes up, but would soon crush his spirits. These events made him much more desparate because he had no support from anywhere and nothing to fall back on in a life or death situation.	2	2		2																					
1187	3	"In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. First of all as he was riding about @NUM1 miles up the road, he saw that the terrain was changing and that scared him, he says �This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly �(kurmaskie @NUM2). He is saying that as the things around him began to change the more he got scared. And he kept drinking a lot of water just to bring down his fear. Another example is after he had left the sign that told him not to pass. He says �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (kurmaskie @NUM3). This is also an example of fear that started over coming him, when he saw even more changes. He wasn�t going to stop because of the road changes and the fact that his water was almost gone he still had the courage to go further. The setting brought him fear but he made it through."	2	3		3																					
1188	3	In the story the cyclisst had ran out of water. He had mentioned it tasted like battery acid. The surroundings affected him by looking around and not seeing anybody around for miles. That brings despair. Also a desert with the hot sun beating down on him and just the sand and catus all around. Now if you saw that you would think of no water or shade of noting because the desert is put to image when you hear those descriptions.	1	1		1																					
1189	3	"The features of the setting, in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affects the cyclist. The setting affect him both physically and mentally. In the story the setting provides no water for the cyclist making him weak. In the mental aspect he is greatly affected by the features of the setting. An example of this is when so see the abandoned welch's factory and sees the picture of a boy ""pour a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth�. This made him hang his head as he rode on. He is also thinking to himself that he will die out of here. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist."	2	1		2																					
1190	3	I believe the first photograph closely relates to the story �As worry� because the authors son suffs a lot. And it shows what he and his friends @MONTH1 look like. Also it shows the surf boards emphasizing there surfers. That is what I believe about the first picture. The second are only relate a little cause it has a surfer surfing. So in conclusion the first photograph is moreaccurate to the story than the second photo.	1	1		1																					
1191	3	When the bicyclist was trying to find Yosemite he stumbled into a million setting. One in the begining when he was talking to the old men on the porch and having him set of into the distance of nothing but dessert. �one rameshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� It�s only him.� At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake � it really did look like ma diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. Tumble weed usually mean's desert. He also saw the @CAPS1 grape juice factory and the bait store where he finally found someone else to give him directions.	1	2		2																					
1192	3	In the story rough road ahead the cyclest is affected by the setting in many ways. Because he was in a desert in June it was very hot, so he got thirsty. Also because of the heat he could have dehydration of heat strokes. Lastly because it was a desert the wild animals like the snakes and lizards could hurt or posion him and he could die that is how the setting of the story affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1193	3	The cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1 suffers from some hardship while riding through the desert. The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation that means there is no water so he was becoming dehydrated. Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldn�t quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasn�t been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welch�s juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved. Also the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left, and rocky tent to take more strength and endurance.	2	3		3																					
1194	3	"In the passage DO Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the desert�s feature did not have any positive affects on the cyclist. The desert contained ""rolling hills."" When a cyclist goes over hills it takes more energy due to the laws of gravity. Because the cyclist used more energy to go over the hills he only had enough energy to ""feel sorry"" for himself. The more hills, the more energy lost, the more tired he became. The desert was also hot, and dry. Obviously, since he was in the ""deserts of California in June."" @CAPS1 the would make him become thirsty. He did stop for water but a ""tarlike substance"" came out instead. When he again stopped later for water it was ""cool"" and most likely refreshing. Riding his bike in the hilly, dry, hot desert the cyclist became tired and thirsty."	3	2		3																					
1195	3	The features of the settings effect the cyclist by obstacles in the settings. A obstacle is a object in the way of you and were your trying to go. Some obstacles in the story such as hills, forks in the road, and also rough road. In the story �@CAPS1 Road Ahead @CAPS2 Exceed Posted Speed Limit the rider runs into� a large highway sign jumped out at me it read: Rough road	2	2		2																					
1196	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, the setting affects the way that the cyclist rides. In this story, the setting is out in nowhere wit no water, and all he can see is roads. This affects the cyclist because he is hungry, thirsty,and now he's about to go down a really steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously insuring himself with noone around to get help from the setting of nowhere affects the cyclist in this story.	1	1		1																					
1197	3	The features in the story tell me that it was in a very dry, not populated area. It says that there were rolling hills, in a desert of California, and that it was dry. I think those things affected the cyclist by dehydrating him. Going up and down hills can be very tiring, especially when you don�t have a lot of water left, and need to save some. The quote �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June,� tells me a lot about the story. In a desert in California in June during the summer is a very brave and stupid thing to do. It s twice as hot during the summer.	3	0		2																					
1198	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by not having good directions from old timers. In the text it says, ''Never accept travel advice, from a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in the office,� this means that the cyclist did not have good directions. Because the road might of changed and the old timers do not know because they been sitting on there porches all the time. The is why I think the salling affects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1199	3	In the essay intitled �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� It talks about a gentlemen who is riding a bike to �Yosemite� and he does not know exactly how to get there. So he stops and ask some old folks and he says �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porchers since Carter was in office.� @CAPS1 means they are not familiar with the changes. After he leaves the old-folks he continues on his long hot journey. He begins to run out of water and so he begins to panic. Next he comes to the sign that said �Rough	1	1		1																					
1200	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is so hot the cyclist keeps drink and sweating water so he is really work down from dehydration and fatigue. Also just the feeling of how unsafe it is out there. Like how he saw a ridiculously large snake or how it just keep getting hotter.	1	1		1																					
1201	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. The setting and the features affected him not only physically, but mentally as well. The setting caused him to doubt himself and the men and also it kept him from having the energy needed to get to where he was going. Where the cyclist was riding, in California, affected him physically. It was hot, and he had no watter. This caused him to become tired and frustrated. The setting affected him emotionally as well. He started off fine, but as he went on, and as the road slowly changed to hills, he began to get frustrated and angred that he listened to the men. As he saw no buildings in sight for many miles, he began to lose his determination as well as hope. Lastly, when he saw the sign �Gary and @CAPS1 Fish Camp� he started to regain hope and become less frustrated. The setting and features of the essay affected the cyclist not only physically, but mentally as well. He started of determined, then as the setting changed he became doubtful and frustrated. In the end, he turned out satisfied as the setting seemed more hopeful.	3	2		3																					
1202	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The text first mentions that, �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or a structure of any kind.� This shows that the cyclist felt in saccure and was starting to upset him. Another example from the text that describes the cyclist is, �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me.� You can see through the cyclists that he was frustrated that the water from the pumps were lame. This also could have sparked fear in the cyclist because he was running out of water. He was terrified that since the water tasted like, �battery acid,� that he wouldn�t last much longer. In- conclusion, the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. 	1	1		1																					
1203	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� many of the features of the setting affect the cyclist on his journey. The rusty water pump, highway sign and abandoned juice factory all seemed to make his trip more difficult than it already was. First of all, when the author stumbles along a �ramshackle shed� surrounded by �several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lames mule�, he is anylous to check the pump for well-needed water. When he finds that he is out of luck and cannot drink the bitter tasting water, his hope droop a little. It is as if the sun were taunting him, telling him that he can�t make it. Secondly, he passes a large road sign reading �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. Once again he begins to feel hopeless, but then turns his angst into determination to finish his journey. He says �sometimes life can be so cruel� as he notices the speed limit to be @NUM1, but he continues on, pedaling hard. Lastly, the author sees a lone building in the distance and almost doesn�t believe his eyes. It turns out to be not only his last hope for water, but an abandoned grape juice factory. He reflect on the irony of his position by saying that his situation �should please all sadists� reading about it. Therefore, the features of the setting affected the reader by highlighting the negativity of his situation, which in turn drives him to continue pedaling.	3	3		3																					
1204	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn�t stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn�t know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasn�t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldn�t cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey.	2	2		2																					
1205	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in several ways. First the rolling hills make it hard to pedal over the land. ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" shows that the terrain was changing into a more difficult course. One long crippling hill,"" also shows how the hills had an effect on the cyclist. Another feature of the setting was the desert and the high temperatures. This caused the cyclist to become dehydrated. ""Trying to keep balance in my dehydrated state"" and ""I could drop from heatstroke"" show me how hot the cyclist was. One final feature that has on effect on the cyclist was the old abandoned factory. The sight of the boy with a refreshing glass of juice makes the cyclist lose hope and he doubts he will survive. ""I hung my head"" and ""abandoned factory of juices and dreams"" tell how the cyclist lost all hope at the sight of the building. All of these features of the setting have negative affects on the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1206	3	The setting of the area where the cyclist was biking effects him because it makes him weaker. Since the cyclist takes the long route, He is in the desert for a longer period of time. Being in extreme heat can cause a person to suffer from major dehydration. We know this was the case for the cyclist because he says, ��but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst�� This @CAPS1 is saying that the cyclist put stones in his mouth to get his mind off of how thirsty he was. I think this @CAPS1 is explaining exactly how dehydrated the cyclist actually was. If he was willing to put filthy stones in his mouth to help him get through his dehydration, he was pretty thirsty. Another thing that effected how thirsty the cyclist got was how hard he worked which was also a feature of the setting since during the end of his trip, he met rough terrain, he exerted more energy which made him sweat even more than he was. This made him @NUM1 more dehydrated. This story is explaining how the features of your environment can either make or break you.	2	2		2																					
1207	3	There are several features of the setting which affect the cyclist one is the fact that he is traveling on a hot day in June. �and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The heat was getting to the cyclist and he was scared he might get heatstroke. The terrain was also not very ideal for a cyclist on a hot @DATE1. �I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The cyclist was tired and the hills were making it worse. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� The cyclist was running out of water quickly and there was nowhere close to get more. These glitches in the setting affected the cyclist because it was extremely hot, he was running out of water and there was rough terrain. The setting was not in the cyclist's favor.	3	3		3																					
1208	3	According to the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit'' the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One way the features of the setting affects the cyclist is that the mountains make the cyclist more tired. Especially because he no water, then having to go up and down hills really wears the cyclist out and causing him to lead into dehydration faster. The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also the snake affected the cyclist. The snake caused the cyclist to be afraid which added to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The factory caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and think about dehydration even more in the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of setting affect the cyclist a lot.	3	2		3																					
1209	3	The fatures of the setting affects the cyclist because in the story the character makes it seem like horrible weather for example when he said �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt� this is one way the setting affects the cyclist because it almost like your in the story and you can imagton what the character Is going through because everything is written in details.	1	1		1																					
1210	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it makes it hard for him to get to �@CAPS1 National Park�. He took advice from some old men to take a shortcut to get him where he wanted to be. On his ride there, he stopped at a �town�, which was, to him, considered a ghost town. Then he got to a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, but it was abandoned years earlier and he was becoming weak and dehydrated. He thought he would drop from a heatstroke. At the end of his ride, he reached a fish camp where he found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, �Know the best way to get there?� The man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist told the man �yes, sir: I own a very good map�. The man realized throughout the setting on his journey, that he would never accept advice from old-timers again.	1	1		1																					
1211	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit� the setting affected the cyclist sense of direction. The cyclist knew where he was going and how to get there but the old men told him their �short-cut.� It ruined his own sense of direction because he was taking out-dated directions from �old-timers that hadn�t left their porches since Carter was in office.� That is how the setting affected the cyclist in the's essay.	1	1		1																					
1212	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist a great deal. I say that because when there is peace and calmness then it motivates you more. Than when there is a lot en stuff around you.	0	0		0																					
1213	3	Steep mountains, rolling roads, jagged rocks � are all reasons why the setting is affected towards the cyclist. Well the cyclist needs to know what is going on and what @MONTH1 happen. For example �Rough Rough: Do not exceed posted speed limit.� This setting lead to a lot of changes. So yes the setting does reveals a lot and I guess it describes how the cyclist @MONTH1 react to it also. So yes I think the settings do affect the cyclist through this whole story.	1	1		1																					
1214	3	What l believe that the features of the setting affect the cyclist is that, �The old guys in the story remember things back how they used to be bot as they say in the book the world iso fluid place things change all the time. So for the cyclist to find his way he had to try and put together the the piece the old guys gave him.	1	1		1																					
1215	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because you wouldn�t put the sitting in rain or he wouldn't be ride the bike. Anther one is you wouldn�t have a the sitting a city when there is nothing around but trees and rivers.	1	1		1																					
1216	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist is that on his way he had to deal with so many things. Like for ex he had trouble with the flat roads that was replaced by short, rolling hills. The next thing was there was a sign that was posted he could not ride @NUM1 he had to do @NUM2 and that made him disappointed. Then a large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of him. He became dehydrated. He became sad, hopless but still had energy to feel himself.	2	2		2																					
1217	3	There are several features of the setting that greatly affect the cyclist. One feature is the desert he is biking through. The heat of a desert in June can easily dehydrate someone. When exposed for a long time, exercising, and running out of water, the effect is even greater. In addition, the change in terrain and road surface would have an effect on the cyclist. Traveling on a flat road requires much less effort then climbing hills. If the road is also rough, the biker has to work even harder to push the up the hill. There is also the mental effort of not tipping the bike on the uneven surface. Finally, there are not any buildings in sight. When someone is dehydrated but has no water, they are desperate to find some. However, if there is nothing they know of nearby, they will start to lose hope. Once they lose hope they won�t try as hard to keep going and they will lose some of their strength. Considering all of the things negatively affecting the cyclist, it is amazing that he managed to push through and reach a source of water. 	2	3		3																					
1218	3	The setting in the short story �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie is troubling to the cyclist �One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the tamest mule greeted me,� made him troubled that he was in the middle of nowhere. The quote, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� shows that he was troubled by having to go over the hills. As you can see the setting was very influental to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1219	3	I the essays the features of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope. The cyclist takes directions by a few old men on a porch. The directions seem incorrect at first. The remains of a Grape Juice factory make it seem like he will never find civilization.	1	1		1																					
1220	3	The features of the setting around the cyclist affected him to the point of exauhstion and dehydration. The cycllist being exauhsted and dehydrated,or tired and thirsty, was beging to wear as the setting went from being flat to many ups and downs. The cyclist exlained the change by saying, �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist�s idea presented here is that he was to find new challenges when riding the hill of this californian desert rollar coaster. His water supply was thinning from the heat and the hills were tiring him beyond reason. All this cyclist could hope for was the blessing of a water refill and the shade of a puffy cloud.	2	2		2																					
1221	3	The setting effected the cyclist severly. Biking in the desert following outdated directions nearly got him killed. He also came across several broken down factories and towns causing more dismay. However he came across a last stop that saved his life.	1	1		1																					
1222	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclistis affected by his surrounding. At first the man starts out at a reservoir camp ground. His confidence is high, and he is ready to continue his adventure. As the day went on and all he could find was abondoned buildings he began to worry a bit water running low he come upon �one ram shackled shed, several rusty pumps� no sign of life. He realiced that his trip was going to be rough. The environment and risk of death gave him the determination he needed to push forward. Although he was fearful of death from dehydration, he knew �travelling through the high deserts of California in June� his only chances of survival was to keep going. The mans surroundings were what had pushed him to keep biking until he found the fish camp. If he had not been so aware of his surroundings he might have given up, but not making it out of the desert to �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite� would be to devastating	1	2		2																					
1223	3	The setting affects the rider because it is very hot wich makes him thirsty. how long the road witch affect his mind state and last the fact that ??? is in sight and that affect is coral	1	1		1																					
1224	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclist�s mood towards the rider. For example, in the essay �Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or sructure of any kind. I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizon� The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps� This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he could�t drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welch�s grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting�s features."	3	2		3																					
1225	3	The setting affected the cyclist in many ways. When he was going up hill it was harder for him to pedal. The hot summer day was breaking him down. He was getting dehydrated because he had a little bit of water left. It said he was trying to keep his balance in my dehydrated state. He felt like giving up.	1	1		1																					
1226	3	Features of the cyclist affected the cyclist in many ways. One was the heat. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 it says, �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 that California is called, �the sunshine state�, I can infer that it was very hot. Another feature that affected the cyclist was when he thought he could get some water but it was hot and tasted like battery acid. This is said in. This is said in paragraph @NUM2. This is how features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1227	3	The setting features affected the cyclist because it was a conflict. It was a conflict because it was hot and he was lost. I was a confict that he was hot because he had a limited amount of water. Which he could get anymoe of because he was lost. The heat causes people to get thirsty but he couldn't because he was limited in water.Another conflict was that he was lost. This was a conflict that because he needed to be some where.	1	1		1																					
1228	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he rode through the heat scorching desert of California, he rode over @NUM1 miles on bike to get to Yosemite, and he almost ran out of water on the journey. What kept him going on was the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.	1	1		1																					
1229	3	There are many ways the cyclist is affected throughout the essay by the setting. As he first enters the �short cut� that the old men give him he is confidenc. When he arrives at the first town and sees that it is like a ghost town he does not fret but continues on his journey in confidence. As he got to the second stop his lack of water began to set in, �I got down on my hands and knees working the handle of the rusted water with all my strength. This shows he will work hard and is in need of water. As the cyclist past another place with no hope of water he placed stones in his mouth because he once heard it helped get your mind off thirst when he had just about lost hope from travelling through the hot @CAPS1 desert with no water he found one lost drive in him when he saw a store with water. Though this was a hot harsh setting it created inspiration for him to keep going and push through the hard times and survive.	3	2		3																					
1230	3	The cyclist in Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit was greatly affected by the setting. There were no buildings or people to the town anywhere. This emptiness meant that there was no help from anyone and he could die with out anyone knowing. Also the setting seems to be very dry and have desert like conditions, without water the cyclist would be dehydrated and could suffer from a heat stroke. Also the setting seems to be very hot. The heartt also makes the cyclist physically dehydrated and mentally considers the logic of a heat stroke at the time.	2	2		2																					
1231	3	The features of the setting had greatly impacted the cyclist. The heat, animals, and terrain had slowed him down throught his journey. The heat had slowed him down because he didn�t have enough water to keep his boby moving normaly, and he said he had slowed him down because he had to sneak around it so it wouldn�t bite him. The hills had affected the cyclist because it takes a lot of energy to go up there, when he said he couldn�t see anything in sight.	3	3		3																					
1232	3	"The arid, bare, and rough terrain of the desert affected the cyclist during his journey to Yosemite in the story �Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit�. The cyclist�s expedition was hindered due to many obstacles. The dryness was a huge problem during his journey. �.I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This exert explain the hot, arid climate of where he was cycling. This climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert. Since the cyclist was riding in the desert, there wasn�t many towns present. When the cyclist did approach a town, it was abandoned. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me� (@NUM2). After riding through the desert, the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest stop, but all of them were ghost towns. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills �(@NUM1). Cycling for hours in a hot desert with limited water wasn�t enough of a challenge; the flat land was replaced with hills. The cyclist is exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with; the rough terrain affected his journey since his rate was reduced. In conclusion, many factors negativly affected the cyclist expedition to Yosemite. The dry, bland, and hilly terrain of the desert hindered his journey"	3	2		3																					
1233	3	I belive the setting of an area can affect the mind when put is certin situations. In the reading the man is cycling and he sees no one, he is almost out of water and cant se a house or a person as far as he can see. This is scary and gives te feeling of helplessness but if he would be in @LOCATION1 and go past cars, people on the street and cars he would be calmer he could get water at only building along his ride the tempature would be cold there far he would drink less and go further. This would have changed his mood.	1	1		1																					
1234	3	Well in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limits by @PERSON1 the setting affects you because if you cant see any thing for miles and you are running out of water it has a sycological effect on you. You can start to panick like he did when it stoped in the old house and all that came out of the pump was battery acid. Also you don know exactly where you are so that also affects u because you don�t know where to go or if you should turn back or what. If I was this person the features around me would have a lot of effect on me. 	2	2		2																					
1235	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the beginning of the essay she was happy that she was getting a shortcut ""I followed their device and launched out at first light along a �shortcut� that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park.� He thought he knew where he was going �I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" When she entered the first town, �this sight was troubling�. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, �she was beginning to get worried/ run out of water, the next town was �only eighteen miles down the road."" He was now at the dehightrated state. � The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips."" Then he saw a building, but it was no longer open, so he got back on his bike, but his thoughts had changed he was now upset and expecting to die. He then saw a store, �Gary and wilbers fish camp�. He went in drank cool water and then on used his own map, rather than old guys."	2	2		2																					
1236	3	There were many features of the setting that had affected the cyclist. One of the features was the lack of water. This had made the cyclist dehydrated and not think right. It had also made the cyclist have less energy. An example is, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� @CAPS1 feature is the heat. The heat had made the cyclist thirsty and sweaty. An example is �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage�� @CAPS1 example is, �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The features of the setting had affected the cyclist in many ways.	2	2		2																					
1237	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclcist. The first feature that affected the cyclist was the desert terain, it very hot and there were no trees to provide shade. This affected the cyclist because he got very hot and thirsty. So he drank more water than usual. Secondly, he was running out of water because he was drinking more than usual so he had to conserve his water, which was making him became dehydrated. That all the towns we past through were ghost towns with no running fresh water, so this extremely dissapointed him, it also furthered his dehydration. Just when the cyclist was losing hope he found a small bait shop and got into the shade and finnaly got water to drink. So after all those dissapointments he found hope, in the small bait shop, which gave him the strength and mental boost to continue on with his journey to Yosemite national park.	3	3		3																					
1238	3	The features of the setting made the cyclist�s journey even longer and more strenuous. The reason it being in such a remote area did not help. For example the people who still lived in that remote area were probably as old as the cyclist grandparents and the directions were horrible. Also, the fact that their were no new shops or areas or rest for the cyclist to go to; the water pump he found was old and nasty and the only building he saw was abandoned. Also ther factor was the rough terrain. It  being froit the cyclist was already very fatigued by lack of water and tiredness the terrain was long, bumpy and just horrible all together. Finally, the last factor was where he was bicycling in California on a @CAPS1 summer day and he being on a which had no n.c(but which bike does) did not help at all. These are how the features affect the cyclist journey.	3	3		3																					
1239	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1240	3	he wouldn�t know he would be faceing while rider or the road @MONTH1 be something bad might happen to his bike or one of his bike�s wheels or he might fall of his the bick he would set so tired that he can�t go any more he might give it up	1	1		1																					
1241	3	The setting sffects the cyclist by the need and comfort of riding down with no infrastructure around or people that most be the best mood nice and colun no cars and just him and the beautiful sky to ride with, like if there is infrastructure he must have to watch for people, cars and just have to day to streetsigns and act. So thats outing  the feature of the setting would affect the cyclsit.	1	1		1																					
1242	3	"In the adventures of the cyclist the setting is not only what developes the character but, that what affects how he pushes himself to not give up, even when he feels helpless. This is one example of how the cyclist is affected, ""I had been hitting my water bottles pretty reguarly and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June,"" With that information you can observe how this harsh setting creates problems for him physicaly because his body needs water. Which he is extremely limited and doesn't savor it very well. These issues create the problem of dehydration, and when mentally you think your going to die without water. You start to panic and lose control over yourself."	3	2		3																					
1243	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. There were	1	1		1																					
1244	3	In ''Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted speed Limit'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting most the time disappoint him. You can tell that the features of the setting disappointed him because every time he got to a town he couldn�t get water. In the text it states, ''I got down on my hands & knees working the handle of the rusty water pump a for like substance oozed out followed by @NUM1 degree brackish water that tasted like battery acid.�� You know the setting disappoints him when he sees the terrain he has to cross as well. You can tell who he says ''At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridicuously large snake.'' The narrarator was disappointed that he listened to the directions of the elder rather than use his map. Joe Kurmaskie does a great job of making one narrarator faced & how he felt about them.	3	2		3																					
1245	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist b/c the route, that the cyclist was taking there was a rough road him to travel. The cyclist took bad advice from some old men that hadn�t left off their porches for decades.  also, as he got into his long journey he began to notice what the advice the old men had given him was bad was bad advice, the cyclist was headed to Yosemite & he had gotten some advice from ???(not legible onwards)	1	1		1																					
1246	3	When the cyclist first set off, he was doing fine, he had plenty of water. As he kept going, and sort of got of cause, he began to come into the desert region. He was hot, and he was ruunning out of water. This was making him dehydrated. Also, seeing the tumbleweeds, and lack of vegetation probably made him even worse mentally, because he was maybe thinking he was never going to get free from that. When he saw the fish bate shop though, he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved,    	2	2		2																					
1247	3	There are many ways that a cyclist will be affected and one of these are the setting. The setting affects them because if it is short smooth setting the ride will be easy. But if it is long bumpy rough roads it will be harder to control the bike which means that the cyclist�s job will be harden this is how a cyclist is affected by his or her settings.	1	1		1																					
1248	3	The cyclist ran into rough settings on the way to @ORGANIZATION1 park. The first is the town he came to was a ghost town. Then he was running out of water when he ran by tambleweeds, and a large snake in front of him. He had no more water and there was rough roads ahead of him and he came across a juice factory. No one was there and he was out of water he did not know how longer it would be until he came tp another town. That is why I say that how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1249	3	The features of the setting have a very negative effect on the cyclist. According to the old men the cyclist would pass by a few towns if he took the route they told him. But every town the cyclist came to was deserted. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� Because the towns were deserted, the cyclist water supply was dwindling because there was no place where he could get more water. He became dehydrated and kept pushing himself to find a place where there was fresh water. �Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� Once he found some pebble and thought about sucking on them because it helps to slow down dehydration. But he didn�t because he thought he would choke on them. The setting around him also made him have negative thoughts. �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� Because the setting was a hot, deserted, desert it had a very negative effect on the cyclist. If he hadn�t been running out of water I don�t think that the effect of the setting would have been as bad. But because he did run out of water it made the effects much worse.	3	2		3																					
1250	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason I say this is because he ran out of water and he could dehidrate. Also looking for water slowed him dsown more. Another reason I say this is because the man gave him the wrong directions, which got him lost and confused. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1251	3	"It is said that, ""experience is a good substitute for @CAPS1 instinct.� This means if someone knows how to deal with the environment they're in they can survive even if they weren't born with the animal instinct that come with the territory. However, even the most experienced person can be overcome by the extreme weather conditions they live in. In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead,� by Joe Kurmaskie, the experienced cyclist decides to take a long, difficult, and dangerous trip. His ride will take him a long the long desert paths of California with a limited water supply. This is the major element that and him in the story. Because he listened to same old men he went without water for most of his trip. Between his constant excersise, extreme heat, and lack of water, dehydration hit him fast. A common side effect of dehydration is hallucination, which the cyclist knew. It says in the essay, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn`t mirage.� This represents his knowledge and experience in the matter, and showed that he was adapt to his environment through experience. A similar story to this is jack @LOCATION2's, �To @CAPS2 a fire� where the man is also pitted against extremes at nature through the vukor, but the elements still ovetook him. Both stories represents man's quest for adventure, and also the canstrant struggle for survival that people face. "	3	3		3																					
1252	3	The feature of a setting can affect a cyclist energy. In the setting turns irds hills, it can every this Cyclist out.	1	1		1																					
1253	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist most on the fact that it strained him out the hydrated state. It made him unable to operate at his full power/efficiency. It deprived him of the little energy he had in him to begin with. That is how the setting affected him.	1	1		1																					
1254	3	The setting affects the cyclist very strongly. The desert and heat with no water cause him to get dehydrated. The rolling hills and rough terrain tire him out. In the story it says �and growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This shows that the heat and terrain could cause him to over heat and live a heat stroke.	1	1		1																					
1255	3	The temperature of the place that the cyclist was riding through affected him very much. The temperature caused the cyclist to sweat. This affected him because he would get thirsty and eventually he ran out of water. For example in the text he says �the water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips� and then it goes on to say, �I could drop from from a heat stroke.� This showed how it affected him because he thought he is going to drop from the heat.	2	1		2																					
1256	3	Features of the setling affected the cyclist were the harsh & hot climate and terrain. The author clearly wrote how �the sun was beating down on him and how he almost died from dehydration.	1	1		1																					
1257	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. If the road is rough you have to have the right bike. Then if you get a flat tire you have to know to look out for dangerous and posionous things. If you were in a real bad accident you�d have to be prepared just in case they don�t find you in time. You would have to know what nights were like. For example, if it got real cold at night you need to keep youself warm.	1	1		1																					
1258	3	The desert and the hills had a huge effect on the cyclist. The desert in June must have been very hot and going up those hills had to be hard. The road was also very rough. It says, �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� It also says, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The cyclist was very thirsty because of the hot weather. I think the setting had a huge effect on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1259	3	"The cyclist�s condition was greatly influenced by his setting because he was lost in the high deserts of California in June. The heat crippiled him or he traveled in search of Yosemite. He became lost and ran out of water making his situation worse. Being lost in seemingly the middle of nowhere in the hot heat he became exausted, dehydrated and fearing heat stroke and loss of consicencess. This is shown in the essay by, ""the growing realization that could drop from heatstroke"" And, ""It looked like i was going to lose concisness for the last time."	1	2		2																					
1260	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Limit�, were very dangerous to his life. The cyclist was traveling to the Yosemite National Park on a hot @DATE1. The cyclist traveled miles after miles on his bike only to past by deserted towns, �This place might have been thriving little spot...a ghost town.� The terrain was threatening because after twenty two miles or so, the cyclist had to overcome, �short rolling hills�, which would use more energy and make his thirst for water even stronger. The cyclist was out of water and the hot day was not helping. After a grueling journey, the cyclist used all the strength he had to go to a local bait shop and drank from the sink after the trechorous environment he was exposed to. The features of the setting in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� were life threatening and almost killed the cyclist, due to lack of water and the terrain he overcome.	1	1		1																					
1261	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist by teasing him. First it was the rippling streams that taunted his thirst, then the old faucet and last the welches grape factory. The strraing were the beginning stage simply provoking thirst then came the faucet. The faucet made him relise that he was dehydrated. And last the abandoned welches grape juice factory had him almost abandon hope. The setting was effecting his mood.	2	2		2																					
1262	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in the story. In the story, it says, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. I could drop from a heatstroke.� This statement clearly says that where the cyclist was riding, water was very hard to find and scare. He is talking about how he will die if he doesn�t get water. Another example is that there are no buildings around and is deserted with no one around and many hills and roads. In the story it says, �the terrain changing flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. This means that he was partially all by himself and he had no one to go to.	2	2		2																					
1263	3	"In this story, the features of the setting heavily affect the cyclist. Certain features portray that this �journey� to Yosemite National Park was dreadful, but at the same time enjoyable. ""I would come to along this breeze jaunt."" The word breezy shows that the cyclist can enjoy riding the bike because there is a breeze. Another feature of the setting is very old and dirty. The water that the cyclist is drinking is drying his mouth out even more. �A tar-like substance oozed out followed by brackish water feeling.� This shows the dirtyness of the water. Also this setting shows the cyclist had to use all he had just to survive. It says �working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength.� @CAPS1, the features portray sacrifice and bravely of the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1264	3	"In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting greatly affects the cyclist. The setting around the cyclist led her to drink a lot of water because of the dry conditions. �I was traveling the hish deserts of California in June� This shows that most likely she was hot, sweaty, and a source of water was not near to her. The rough terrain also led to her using own strength to get up and down hills, and to get plants and animals. The settings in the story led the cyclist to become dehydrated and weak, she was forced on as low supply of water and dodge numerous hazards, with no sign of living people near her. �This place might have been a thrivins little spot at one time say, before the last world was"" This suggests a ghost town, where no people were currently living. There was nobody around her to help. The setting led to her deteriorating health. Her physical health was in danger because of her dehydration and her lack of energy. Her mind was also starting to ware. She had a shake her head to make sure what she was seeing in one part of the story.   "	3	2		3																					
1265	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didn�t have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� the speed limit was @NUM1. One more thing is make sure you don�t listen to a gentleman that is old and hadn�t be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1266	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist since it is affecting her condition. She needs water to survive, and the next town is very far away. So she could possibly pass out without brake, and the hot temperatures. �When I tried a draper I was, it had the flavor of battery acid� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). If she doesn�t find water soon, it will affect herb condition. Also, the features of the setting affects her determination. When she knows that she needs to find a town. she works harder. ""i would conserve my water go inward for an hour or so atleast or my inner spirit""(@NUM1). She would try her hardest to make smart moves, and make it to a town, as fast as possible. She works harder since she knows without water, her life is in danger. Now, things could get even rougher."	3	2		3																					
1267	3	"During the cyclist journey in �Rough Road Ahead� by joe Kurmaskie he expierences setting changes such as the road being flat then going to short rolling hills. When hes wrideing he says the road is flat. �Flat road was replaced"" This tells us the road he was on was nice and flat. Then as hes rideing he notice the land change.� Flat road was replaced by, short rolling hills.� this tells us that the cyclist will have more trouble sence the terrain changed. That�s how the land changes  "	1	1		1																					
1268	3	The features affect the cyclist.The setting affects the cyclist because it�s real hot. So he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men. Then come to find out these tips weren�t really short cuts. So now he�s riding and angry that he took their tips. Also he�s running out of water and becoming dehydrated. He sees an abonded place with water, but in order to get it you need to pump it. So he starts pumping and sees black gunk. He pumps for about @NUM1 to cool the water, but it doesn�t cool off. Come to find out the water tastes like battery acid. So he starts riding again. but encounters a snake. Luckily he gets away, but he feels that he�s about to die and regrets listening to men who haven�t got off their porch since @PERSON1 was president. What makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure. As as he's riding he sees a juice factory and goes there. Now it�s a fishing store and drinks lots and lots of water. He also says he�s never listening to old men and he�ll always use the map.	3	2		3																					
1269	3	As the author of the story goes on her bike trip, the landscape around her becomes less and less welcoming. The first thing the cyclist encounters is a rusty pump & old shed. When the cyclist tries to get water from the pump, she describes the water as very hot and not cooling down at all. When the cyclist continues, tumble weeds that look like �diamond head snakes� cross her path. She encounters no buildings for a long time when she does encounter a building, It is abandoned and suggests that people left because of the landscape. The cyclist encounters another elderly man in her journy but decides not to take his advice because of the path the last set of elderly men set her down. 	2	2		2																					
1270	3	The features of the surrounding setting affect the cyclist from hi/her performance for example, In the essay �Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted SPeed Limit� the setting is full of hills, twisting, rising and desending. All of these things are working against the energy that the cyclist has. Also, the lack of the people in towns give the cyclist a hard and depriving time on finding a water supply so he/she does not dehydrate. Third the weather in the essay has a great deal of being affected on the cyclist it is hot in the desert of California and the cyclist has to be very hydrated to continue on his bike ride.  	2	2		2																					
1271	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways, they ware heat, lack of water, and hills. While on his journey he almost gets dehydrated because he does not have a good supply of water and he said they taste �like battery acid.� And he had to convince up the road for anothe @NUM1 miles so that he could finally replenish himself	1	1		1																					
1272	3	The features of the setting affect the cycleist by hurting his ability to keep going. In this story the cyclist was faced with many setbacks or problems. At first he took advice from very old man who had out of date directions. Then the cyclist thought he could keep going on a very limited water supply. The cyclist then was getting dehydrated and angry. The cyclist then found an old building which raised his hopes only to drop them once he found out it was closed and rundown. Finally he finds a store and then dehydrates and is on his way again.	1	1		1																					
1273	3	I think features affect the cyclist because when you write a bycles you need to con	1	1		1																					
1274	3	"In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist has a very long journey that it�s affected by a variety of things, and problems. The cyclist is confident with himself at the beginning but after a few moments he feels really bad, and learns a really good lesson. �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state."" the cyclist shows that it is really hard for him to move without water. This quote shows that he is not only thirsty but dehydrated which is several for a human being. The cyclist also had a really bad time, because he had to taste stones in order to make his thirst go away, one example of that is when"	2	2		2																					
1275	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist is confronted with a troubling setting on his journy to Yosemite. He is led away from the steady road as a result of taking mislead advice from an old group of individuals. In this essay the setting plays a crucial impact on the cyclist. In the essay, the author sets up the story describing the day as, �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Because of the amount of heat the cyclist was enduring, he became weary and dehydrated. Alone with this, the cyclist had to work much harder because the man noticed, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This setting is a major setback to the cyclist�s journy, and required him to persevere. In my life there have been numerous obstacles which I have had to persevere through. One of which had been when I was out camping, and suddenly, as in the essay, the setting changed, and a storm came. Though the other campers and I did what we needed to to make the best outof it. In the essay, the cyclist is affected greatly by the setting. This was the same in my experience as the setting affected myself. In both situations, perserverance led to a final satisfaction of the journey.	3	3		3																					
1276	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the roads are bumpy. The other things that is effecting the cyclist is the water on the roads. There are a lot of curved roads which always slows down his speed.	1	1		1																					
1277	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The setting is described as a rough terrain, which makes it harder for the cyclist to travel. Also it�s hot, and there are no buildings or people around. This also makes it hard for the cyclist because he runs out of water. throught the story the cyclist keeps going and ends up sarving	1	1		1																					
1278	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist because the surrounding is so negative. Everything around the cyclist is percieved negatively, so the naturally the cyclist feels like the task is harder and more challenging than it really is. For example, nothing is surrounding the cyclist but sand and the hot temperature since the setting is so empty and no one is around, then everything seems harder than it really is. Also the cyclist feels like he can�t go on and is weak because there is no living he around him. Furthermore, if the cyclist was in the park with the sun shining and people around and in sight, his attitude would change and everything would seem easier.	1	1		1																					
1279	3	The fatures of the setting affected the cyclist by it hard for him to control hill bike down on rough road, hotter making him thisty and running out of water. Also there wasnt an building in sight so he could get anything to drink. Also he did know where he was go. These are the features that affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1280	3	The setting affect the cyclist in many gruding and harsh was. First, the lack of civilization contributes to an uneasy feeling and an inability to refill his water bottle. Second, the heat and uphill bottles are taking their tollon both aplists physical and mental strength. Third, his water bottle is emptying at an alarming late due to his third and relentless heat. In paragraph four die exospodent cyclist reaches the first ''town.'' This place @MONTH1 have been a striving spell but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of ghost down.� @CAPS1 he came to house with a rusty water pump, which sped out brackish, near boiling water, which did not support the porched cyclist, physically, on mentally.	2	2		2																					
1281	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because �never accept travel advice from	1	1		1																					
1282	3	"The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way. He intrusted that these men he had asked directions from knew what they were talking about. With the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination. Only to find deserted towns, disowned factorys, and hills. With all this being the �high deserts of California in June.� With all these aspects the cycalrst was worn out and dehydrated saying �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst"" shaving his deep name of thirst. After finding a place to get a drink he stated �I had an overwhelming and buy some bait� showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water."	2	2		2																					
1283	3	"In the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. One way is that the harsh conditions of the desert make him need alot of water resources. This is because the heat and exercise will dehydrate him. This is evident in the story because after he drinks all his water, he is desperate enough to try to drink out of an old pump that had black sludge in it. This is how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.  "	1	1		1																					
1284	3	While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite. �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� The cyclist continued on his spirits as well as her water supply going down. The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building. ��telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine.� @CAPS1 many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones. ��slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� @CAPS2 the cyclist found a deserted building, he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist found open store with modern bathrooms, he had �an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1, kiss them, and buy some bait.� At the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map.	2	3		3																					
1285	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Kurmaskie, the cyclist went through hard times, trying to get to Yosemite National Park. A cyclist is someone who tried their bike mostly all the time to get somewhere. First off the cyclist asked old men for directions to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist knew that was a mistake in the first place, but he had hope that maybe they knew what they were talking about. Seccondly on his trip, he came accrossed an �Ghost town� with nothing in sight but a bike snake. The cyclist became dehydrated and was running out of water, the only water he	2	2		2																					
1286	3	Well some features might have more than others and the cyclist might have more than others. Also the author faced alot of problems like the lack of water, the poisonous snakes and the condition of the road. So there were many thing that affected the author and the cyclist, when they were on there journey.	2	2		2																					
1287	3	In the passage �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� there are many features from the setting that affected the cyclist. One feature that affected the cyclist was the snake he encountered on his way, for example in the text it says �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�, �I cased post, tyring to keep my balance in my dehydrated state� This proves that the snake was a feature that affected the cyclist by giving him a point to stay calm even in the state he was in being dehydrated and all the affects he encountered from that.	1	1		1																					
1288	3	There is many things that could have made his bycicle ride much more enjoyable, one thing is if he wasn�t in the middle of no where and if he actually knew where he was. For example, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� There, he had almost no water to get him through the day. For instance, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, he did not know where he was going so it was harder for him. In conclusion these are some things that made his trip hard.	2	2		2																					
1289	3	The feature of the setting do affect cyclist in such ways making him illusionalistic and dehydrated. He saw all idea that a juice factory was working, when it was abounded. He saw rusty pipes, this made him dehydrated because he knew those pipes could never produce water.	1	1		1																					
1290	3	In the short story �Do not exceed posted speed limit� the settings of the story affect the cyclist. They make him think he will die and overall make him worried. In the story the cyclist takes two old men�s advice on the best way to get to Yosemite mountin and gets himself in the middle of nowhere. He finds himself in the California desert without water, he lets this go to his head. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� That line was from the last page of the story. The biker was taking an unfamiliar route and he let himself believe he would die. He knew he was in the desert without water the setting makes him nervous because he was in a desert. He wouldn�t have been nearly as nervous if he was in a forest where there are streams. He lets the desert and the heat convince that he is going to die. By coming across ghost towns he believes he will never see anothe person again, he gets oledrar because of where he is. He thinks the heat will kill him. The setting affects him and tricks him into believing he is going to die.	3	2		3																					
1291	3	The feature of the setting including the conditions, weather, and amount of water can possibly decide the life or death of the cyclist. The conditions such as hills, and rocky roads can decied a future for a cyclist because if the rocky roads turn you off balance you could fall down a hill and give yourself an injury or possibly die. For example, in the short-story it says, �over one long crippling hill, a building came into view� This shows the conditions in which the cyclist had to deal with. In addition, the weather and amount os water can also decide the future. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.� This shows us that if the cyclist gets dehydrated enough he could pass out and no one would find him in the desert. In addition, the heat isn�t helping him out any once he could die without anyone knowing. These reasons show us a cyclist needs to make sure they have enough water and the conditons and weather is right so they don�t make a life-threating choice.	3	2		3																					
1292	3	When the cyclist is at his low point, he is an abandoned ghost town, looking for water that tastes like battery acid. The cyclist feels hopeless in the abandoned town. When he first reaches the water pump and the abandoned juice building he has a little hope only to be let down, because the building has no juice and the water pump�s water is too hot and the water is not any good. The setting is the reason his mood changes through out the story.	1	2		2																					
1293	3	I am going to write a response that explains how the features of the setting affects the cyclist. In my response, I will include examples from the essay that support my conclusion. I think the features in the setting affect the cyclist because different things such as snow or rocks could affect the way someone rides.	0	0		0																					
1294	3	In the begining of the story, a young cyclist sets out on a long journy to Yosemite national park. Along  his ride he meets some old but confident men. They tell him a new rout wich �was to slice away hours� from his ride the setting was excedingly hot @DATE1. He was supposed to encounter a few thriving towns along the way the first was a �baren ghost town� the next had water �the flavor of battery acid, then he came to an abanded welches grape juice factory. The author navigated through a very trying setting until he reached a baite shop. The advice that he gives to his readers is to stick to your guns & don�t let old timers try and change your mind.	3	2		3																					
1295	3	In the essay �Rough Road ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had many changes due to the setting of what was around. The cyclist was lost in the dessert. This affected him a lot because the desert is very hot. He could have died from either dehydration or exhaustion. Also, in the desert some animals can be very dangerous on the cyclist journey, he saw a poisonous snake. It was a good thing that he was cautious around the snake because if he wouldn�t have been, he might have gotten bitten and there would be no one around to help him. The desert that he was in. also happened to be desserted and there was no one around to help him with the directions. The worst thing would have to be that he ran out of water. Without the water, he could become very weak and dehydrated.  and could have even died. The setting of where the cyclist was affected him greatly.	2	2		2																					
1296	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him thirsty and him thinking he is lost and going to die. The cyclist got information from an old guy that has not been off his porch for years. Just when the cyclist thought he was lost he saw �Gary and Wilber�s fish camp-if you want bait for the big ones, were your best bet!� The cyclist went in and got water, and the old man asked him if he wanted to know where to go, but this time he said no.	2	2		2																					
1297	3	"In the short story �Do not exeed the speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has great impact on the cyclist. In the begining of the story he describes the scenery as ""@CAPS1"". As he continued following the old mens out dated advice. It lead  him through more barren lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was �One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic� he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head"" he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called ""@PERSON2 and wilbers�s fish camp. ""This is where he drunk water and became repleshed. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist. Because depending on the location, decided weather he would live or die in the hot deserts of California."	2	2		2																					
1298	3	One of the main things that affect the cyclists is the heat. Due to the heat he drinks all of his water. Another feature of the setting that effects the cyclist is the rough road since he is so tired he has a difficult time riding on the hills and other hard road conditions.	1	1		1																					
1299	3	In the story,� Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� written by the @CAPS1, the setting reflects how the cyclist is feeling. For example, �Flat roads was replaced by short, riding hills �@CAPS2 as the terrain was changing, so was his attitude. When he first started the journey, he was happy and care free and the land had no hills and he flat. However, once he notice that everything is not has the men said, he seems to grow a little angry and upset, @CAPS2 like the land seemed to reflect this soon he found himself in a bumby and unpleasant road. The setting also seemed to give the man more obstacles to overcome on adventure� tumbleweeds crossed my path a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the movement in front as me.� The land seemed to be leasing and tormenting him, when he started to figure out that listening to the old men was a mistake.    	3	3		3																					
1300	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the features of the setting affects the cyclist by draining him of energy, he is sweating so much, he keeps on drinking his water and slowly finishes it and still has a long ride ahead of him. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.�(Kurmaskie�s) since is was so hot the cyclist was thirsty and drank all of his water. It was a warm day and he needed to stay hydrated.	1	2		2																					
1301	3	In the book �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting was in codi, California. The author went on a journey	1	1		1																					
1302	3	Throughout the riders long journey the setting greatly affected him. For example, the hot weather caused him to drink the majority of water suply making him dehydrated and tired. If the weather was cool he would have lasted much longer.	1	1		1																					
1303	3	"In this story the cyclest was affected physically and emotionally in many ways. One such way was the setting around him. For example, when he rode into the first town he gained of boost of confidence because he believed that he was on the right track to Yosemite. Then when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows how hopeless the man fealt. when he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp"" he was relieved and thankfull because he no longer had death blazing towands him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and empty water bottle. This was how the the features and setting affects him in many ways."	3	2		3																					
1304	3	Riding through beastly mountains, hot and burning deserts and no water. A cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions. The two old men gave him the wrong directions and send him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through. First he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion. Maps are made for people to use so if you have a map you should trust it and in the ending it shows that the cyclist learned that because he said �And I promised myself right then that I�d always stick to it in the future.�	3	3		3																					
1305	3	In the short story � Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed pusted speed limit.� A lot of things affeced cyclist. Such as the rocky road , and the lack of water for example where the author says �when I tried a drop or two, It had the flavor of battery acid.� this shows how has loosing lope, and he seems a little scared. Also the abandond towns  didn�t help.	1	1		1																					
1306	3	All the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hoy out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips� and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke.	2	2		2																					
1307	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY DEPLETING HIS WATER SUPPLY, AND ALMOST GIVING HIM HEAT EXHAUSTION. IN THE TEXT, HE SAYS: THE WATER BOTTLES CONTAINED ONLY A FEW TANTALIZING SIPS.� THIS HOTNES HE HAS LITTLE WATER LEFT FOR SURVIVAL UNTIL HE RUNS OUT.	1	1		1																					
1308	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. At first it was flat road which the speaker was happy with and he had �a smile on.� (@NUM1). Then came large rolling hills which created a challenge, the cyclist needed to muster up enough energy to continue. The rough terrain was next causing the cyclist to work even harder to cycle. As if the rough terrain wasn�t energy soaking enough, a snake blocked a majority of pavement and large elevations came into play. The harder the terrain, the harder for the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1309	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because depending on how the setting is, is how much skill they need. Like if their going down hill then they really only need to know how to control the bike. If their going up a mountain with lots of bumps they need to have some skill. Usually if their riding in a shady area then the wear clothes to keep them cool. But if their going to be in the sun the they need to wear light clothes. The setting affects the rider very much.	1	1		1																					
1310	3	"The setting in �Do not exceed posted speed limit affects the cyclist in many ways. The old men told the cyclist there were flat roads on the path he was to take, when the cyclist got there, there were hills not flat roads. The cyclist traveled through the desert to get to his destination. He started to run out of water because it was so hot and humid. He started to get dehydrated and could bairly keep his balance. In this story the cyclist had to pass a large snake �a ridiculously large"" snake � it realy didn�t look like a diamondback � blocked a majority of the pavement in front of me �(Kurmaskie). The snake was big and the cyclist had to work his best to pass it while wobbling from dehydration. The settings in this story had effect on the cyclist in many ways."	2	2		2																					
1311	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many readers after another. @CAPS1 are some examples why the cyclist was bike riding down a windy road. He is in a hot place similar to a desert. It is very hot there and is affecting him during his travels,""I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Another thing that affected him because of the setting was that the desert had rocky roads and windy paths because he followed the old mans direction. ""Rough Road Ahead"" are final example is that he was in the desert so he saw a snake come out of the tumbleweeds."" A large snake it really did look like a diamond back."" @CAPS1 are three examples how the cyclist had been affected due to the setting of the story.   "	2	2		2																					
1312	3	The fetures in the settings like hills, make the cycleist use more energy, the more enegy that he uses the more water he will whant to drink. This is difficult because he states �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips�. Therefore he was in trouble.	2	2		2																					
1313	3	In the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example he is in the desert and it is very hot outside. Also he is running out of water. This is bad because he could become dehydrated. Another example is when he comes upon the building he thinks it is a mirage at first because he�s pretty much dehydrated. The rough terrain also makes it hard for him to pedal and he is already weak from lack of water. In conclusion all these elements of the desert affect the cyclist in some way.	2	2		2																					
1314	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist�s mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old men�s knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps�with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.� The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn�t care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best.	3	3		3																					
1315	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit while riding his bike the author Joe Kurmaskie has alongride. Where he is riding there is up and down hills also the road is very rough. He was running out of water in the desert. �I stopped at a rusted water pump to get water and a tar like substance oozed out.� @CAPS1 that he is off his bike he least worrie about the posionous snakes of the desert. He founded Welch�s grape juice factory but it was abandoned. The author found a bait shop and got water	2	2		2																					
1316	3	In the short story �Do not @CAPS1 the Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. In the story the cyclist experiences many changes in temperature and climate. He also experiences changes in land structure which makes it extremely hard to pedal and get where he needs to. From my reasoning is why the setting @MONTH1 affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1317	3	The hot sun and the desert features in the setting are affect the cyclist in ways that could potentially stop him from making it to his destination. The sun is beating down on him and is making it harder for him to reach his destination. �The sun was begining to beat down...wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.� By him being so hot and tired fromthe sun, he thought that he would die from dehydration. This would very likely stop him from making it to his destination, Yosemite. His lack of water supply didn�t help the situation either because he could only go @NUM1, was �water depleting @NUM2.�	2	1		2																					
1318	3	The features  of the   setting   does   affect the cyclist. For example, if it is hot outside then he would need more water than normal. Also if it was raining he would have to drive more careful. That is why the setting would affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1319	3	"The environment around people in certain situations can affect them in many ways. For instance if  you are hot, tree could be shade, or thirsty, a river neer by could help your thirst. If you were hungry and hot, but nothing was near you this could make you hot. In this cyclist case the environment affected him in many ways, from bumpy roads, �ghost towns, and trees. For example he said, �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barley noticed,� this is because of the ""cool pines"" around him as he explains in the next paragraph. It also says in the text that the terrain changed and he even came upon a snake, which added to his thirst. So then making it harder for him to go one. From reading the the text on can see how features can have effects on a person."	2	2		2																					
1320	3	"The features of the setting stronger, effect the cyclist's journey to Yosemite. The features of the land;in, and hills, the fact that it is desert, and the setting in the middle of june also effect this story.The dry and hills land is a huge factor for the main character. Because if is hilly, he has to work twice as hard. The land is dry, so he his thirsty and has no where to get anything to drink.The land is also desert, so there is no where he can go for help or to get food, water, or civilization. He believes that he is not going to make it. The text explains in paragraph !!, "" the growing realization that i could drop from heatstroke on a goregous day on June simply because i listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh"" The setting plays a huge role in the story. It is hot, dry, and deserted this out effects the main character and journey."	3	3		3																					
1321	3	The cyclist in the essay Rough Road Ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit feels discouraged and dehydration because of the setting. Near the beginning, after viewing the first stop which consisted of a few broke buildings and some rusted pumps he states �This sight was troubleing,� He also feels dehydration when he reaches the pumps and finds the produce �A tar like substance oozed out, followed by blackish water�. Also as he is pedaling he sees a sign that says do not exceed 55 miles per hour. He	3	3		3																					
1322	3	In this quick passage by Joe Kurmaskie, the many conditions  of the road and the area around it determine how he acts and what he feels, � The  sun was beginning to beat down , � (Kurmaskie) .He is starting to get tired �because � it is becoming hot and sunny, so he is feeling less confident. He was traveling through the high deserts of California in June �. (Kurmaskie).Not only is he very tired and hot not where he is riding is barron and open and there is no one around him to give him help or to find water. Through the passage you can tell that the temperature and weather around the cycler can change how and why how he does. 	2	2		2																					
1323	3	that   explains  for my features I�m the of the setting affect the cyclist. the   essay that support your conclusion is the cyclist .the features is the setting becaused the cyclist the Include the support for the conclusion.	0	0		0																					
1324	3	The scenery makes the cyclist hapy. He�s sooooooooooooo happsy! Woohoo! happsy	0	0		0																					
1325	3	In this story the setting has a affect to the cyclist trip and to him self. It being hot and over @NUM1 degrees and going down hill with a lot of turns. The cyclist is getting so hot that hes water is no longer cold. Being in this desert is killing and about to make him have a heartstoke. All the things in the desert is doing a lot affect to the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1326	3	The setting of a situation can affect a person both mentally and physically. This is evident in @PERSON1 �Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit.� The cyclist is unaffected, for the most part until the directions he was given by �a collection of old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� takes him over terrain not suitable for biking. Prior to following the men�s directions, the setting was enjoyable a made for an easy ride a reader knows this because the cyclist is confident. For example, he says �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of yosemite had my name written all over them.� This confidence begins to depleat as the cycling gets harder. For example, the cyclist says �sometimes life can feel so cruel.� after he hits rolling hills and a sign warning of rough road and not exceeding the speed limit. The cyclist became disappointed and wanted to give up because he couldn�t even reach that limit. However, he�s determined and pushes through to reach a shop. This gives a sense of satisfaction and confidence. So in conclusion setting can have a powerful affect on mood or motivation.	3	2		3																					
1327	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him ???  are ??? like when he rood through that ghost town. The setting is a big part of this story thats all that talk about. And when hes getting water or how the tumbleweeds are crossing the road. He was all ways thirsty and rode his bike along ways and is no paint in ??? ??? ???.	2	2		2																					
1328	3	How the setting changes the mood of the cyclist is that what he sees pretty much discribes how he feels. Like he starts off with strong less and a smile on his face. Then he comes to the first town which was a ghost town, that didn't really dampen his spirits because when he sees it he laughs. Also when the setting changes so does his confidence in the old men's direction giving. Like at the first town he still has confidence in what they told him. Then he notices that it starting to get hotter but that doesn�t change his mood much. @NUM1 miles later comes top a fork in road with rusty water pumps and a ran down car all that makes him less confidence in water level. Then he realizes the next town is a long way away so he losse more confidence and gets more worried about water. Then the flat road is replaced with rough road so his mood goes down more. Then at last he goes to a fishing store and so he gets water and his spirits go way up. Here is how the setting affected his mood.	2	3		3																					
1329	3	The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke. Also his lack of water made him extreamly tired as he petaled. Next the sun was beating down so not only was he tired due to his lack of water but also because of it being so hot out he was loosing water and energy from his sweat. Thats why the features and setting made his journey to YoSemite difficult.	2	2		2																					
1330	3	In the short story, �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The cyclist experiences some difficult times. When starting the journey he had very little water. Because it was hot and dry his water went quickly leaving him very little water for the rest of the trip. The ragh roads also made him, tired making it harder to make the journey.	1	1		1																					
1331	3	Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are �the cool pines and rushing rivers� they affect the cyclist by keeping him cool and energized by the senery and the temperature, another is the juice factory and it was old and shut down showing that he would die alone. The goast town which was completely and utterly desserted showing that the place is barren and unlivible these are some of the features the affect the biker.	2	1		2																					
1332	3	The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In �Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says �Over one long, crppling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1333	3	Heat, dessert, humidity � all are things that affect the cyclist as on his journey. First, heat because the heat is making him thirsty for water @CAPS1 he is running row on. For example, the narrator describes, �� water bottles only had a few tantalizing sips.� This means that the day is hot and running out of water. Second, dessert because the narrator is the only one around and deserts are usually diserted. For example the narrator exclaims �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, structure of any kind.� @CAPS1 clearly states that he could be in a dessert where no one wants to be. Lastly, humidity, because it can be hot but then the humidity comes into plan and makes the sky more dry and seen hotter than it usually is. This is why heat, dessert, and humidity all are things that affect the cyclist as he is on a journey.	2	2		2																					
1334	3	The features of the setting greatly affect this cyclist. At first he is fine riding along the old-timers �shortcut� as he states that �things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� But what he didn�t know was this was the beginning of a very rough day. He arrived at the first �town� which was a ghost town. He wasn�t overly worried yet but at about sixty miles in on his journey he came to a ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a broken down corral. The cyclist explains how he had drank a lot of his water and was in need of some. He tried the pumps but he explains how �a far like substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� A couple miles later he came to a highway sign that read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The cyclist continued on desperate for water. He even came across a snake. He was now fearing a heat stroke. He came to an abandoned grape juice factory and hung his head. The cyclist then was almost completely dehydrated from the long, tiring bike rid. The cyclist was sure he was going to die from dehydration or a heatstroke that this terrible ride had caused. He finally came to a shop a drank from the sink. So this ride was torturous due to the setting.	3	3		3																					
1335	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in positive and negative ways. At first, there were the two old men who gave the cyclist the out-of-date information. They affected him negatively because if it wasn�t for them, the cyclist would have never gotten lost. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, the water pump affected him, the cyclist was running out of water and the water from the water pump tasted like battery acid and was about @NUM1�. The cyclist was becoming more and more dehydrated and the small, rolling hills didn�t help his dehydration, he also used a lot of energy in order to go over the hills. Finally, he found Gary and Wilber�s fish camp where he was able to get water. This whole experience in a way, affected the cyclist positively even though, at the time, he was affected negatively. The cyclist learned to not take advice from really old people who �haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� The cyclist was affected positively and negatively by the features of the setting.	1	1		1																					
1336	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.� Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California in deserts. Finally he sees bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all. Based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map. 	2	2		2																					
1337	3	The features in the setting affect cyclist in many ways. One of which is bring only to carry so much equipment which @MONTH1 be needed. For example, you can only take so much water with you and once you run out of there are no buildings or anything around that you are out of luck. Also, you can only take so much food. Finally, when you are ready to go to sleep you can�t just pull over you have to ride until you find a hotel or get home. I know that I would not make it. So those are just a few reasons on why the setting affects cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1338	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him dehydrated, troubled, and relieved. The cyclist is dehydrated because of the horrible heat. He says �the growing realie at von that l would drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This means that the heat is a treat to him and would cause him to become dehydrated and have heatstroke. The cyclist is troubled by the scarce sourroundings. ""a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule.� He is getting worried because there is no one around and his directions are starting to sound wrong. The cyclist is relieved by the water from the sink. He had the �overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.� This means that that he is so relieved that he has finally found water and he wants to thanks the owners of the bait shop for providing it."	3	3		3																					
1339	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him in a way because he wouldn�t have to use strength and pedal as hard without having as much water in his body. When he came to a pump, it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid. The dryness of the dessert had a bad affect on the cyclist because he wasn�t able to get to the Yosemite water until the end. The breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down. The features of the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1340	3	Many things that involve settings can affect other things. In the �Do not exceed the posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is affected by the setting as he travels to Yosemite National park. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day�.� (kurmaskie @NUM1). The sertting from the day is affecting him very much and it is hard for him to continue. He is very tired and almost sick from the heat. The settings of this place are hurting to the cycleist and he wants to go home and away from the heat. The setting of this place effects the cyclist very much.	2	2		2																					
1341	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One way that the features affect the cyclist, is that it is summer time, and it harder for the cyclist because	1	1		1																					
1342	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way could be if the setting was in, like, a place with a lot of water, then the cyclist wouldn�t have to worry about dehydration. Another reason would be if the old men were never outside in the first place, then none of this would have also happened.   	1	1		1																					
1343	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist physically. The want of the California desert canes the cyclist to became tired and dehydrated. For example the another states �I cased past, trying to keep my balance dehydrated star,� The setting is the main factory which causes the cyclist to become dehydrated.	1	1		1																					
1344	3	One part of the setting that is affecting him is the sun, which is mercilessly overheating the biker. Another problem is the terrain he is on, which is a number of small hills is wearing him out. There are also apparently no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool him off.	1	1		1																					
1345	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as the terrain got rougher things to the cyclist got harder. In paragraph @NUM1; there is a senteance that says, �It read: Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� In the next paragraph the cyclist comments, �sometimes life can feel so cruel.� @CAPS1 because the road ahead got rough to the cyclist life was cruel. All the features like the snake, lack of water and rolling hills are all obsticules in life, people have to experience. We might not like it but the reward at the end is wonderful.	2	2		2																					
1346	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the conditions of the road and weather. he hit some bad and nasty water. along with other hazardous things, he also tried to ride through a desert where he had already drank all his bottles of water and had nothing left to drink, he was very dehydrated and had to drink nesles water. It was hard for him to keep going, being dehydrated so bad but he had to. at one point a big snake almost took up the entire road and he had to just ease his way on by it, his riding conditions were so bad, he thought he was going to die, he said the birds were going to eat him. The weather was so hot it was hard to go on, he finally found a bathroom, went inside it drank water from the sink and yellced to a man that told him the direction he wanted	2	2		2																					
1347	3	The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. First in the story when describing the setting it says �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� @CAPS1 basically giving a hint or foreshadow that something bad is going to happen because hes alone. Another description of the setting when it affects the cyclist when it says �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� @CAPS1 pretty much saying danger ahead, something bad will happen.	1	1		1																					
1348	3	The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. How because there was not a posted speed limit up there cause the cyclist went right throw and over goin faster then he was suppored to.	1	1		1																					
1349	3	Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all. They showed the trecherous path he took the obstacles he had to surpass the prevail. The purpose of including some features of the setting like the poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, no signs of life, and no water all show and impact how bad the conditions were. If it left out these sectives the audience could say/think he was traveling through any old trail, for all they know the cyclist could be traveling along a windy river passing threw nice developed towns, so you see the features in the setting help set the mood and also reveal the confident of the story.	1	2		2																					
1350	3	When you do something really to often you get used to it, well I think is the same thing with how sitting affects the cyclist features. It might make their butt flat or their back has a diferent shape and with different shep I dont mean that they are diformed but evey person is diferen so their back can either have a �@CAPS1� shape or an �I� shape or a �D� shape.	0	0		0																					
1351	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in these ways. The cyclist was very hot. �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from heartsroke on a gorgeous day in June.� The towns that passed through that were supposed to have people were in fact deserted. His ride ended up being even harder than it would have been. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		3																					
1352	3	There are many features of the setting that would affect the pedalists. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills �(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows the change of terrain. Hills must be traveled up to get to the other side and that takes much time and eneegy, especially for bike riders. �high deserats of California in June �(kurmaskie @NUM1) shows heat. Heat makes it harder for most people to concentrate and causes people to heat overheated when exerting much force at once. These two co	2	2		2																					
1353	3	The different settings of the cyclist affected him by how he felt when he rode the bike on the rode. He was well excited and happy that he is going on the ride and how he truly felt about how he rode the bike real fast through the short cut. And how he came over a long, crippling hill he was riding real fast. So unfortunately he was riding fast non stop and how he came through the whole road with relief. He felt so free and how he when he came over hills that are tall and large. But he mostly believed he could find his way at the end. He said it himself he always stuck in the future. So he�s keeping his future and his wisdom to himself. He thought he was gonna die but all he had to do is ask for a little push. But different things did affect the cyclist by doing the impossible of his very bright future.	1	1		1																					
1354	3	One of the biggest problems that the author faced in his essay was his surroundings. The setting of the story in Yosemite provided many obstacles such as the vastness of the park, the summer heat, and the fact that many places had been abandoned. The summer heat was the biggest problem for the cyclist. He had to bike many miles, but he only had limited supply of water. Eventually, his water supply began to run low, which increased his determination to find the next town before he collapsed. It is this determination which moves him from ghost town to ghost town and keeps the story moving. Another big problem was the vastness of Yosemite National Park, which he was biking through. Any wrong turns (which he took, thanks to the direction he was given) could get him lost and thrown off track for a very long time. It was his confusion as to where the next time was that kept him biking, with difficulty and made for an interesting story. An example of the vastness of the park was when he quote, �About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first �town.� This place might have been a thriving spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This quote shows that even after many miles, he hadn�t seen a sign of anyone living, which would have increased his desperation to keep looking for civilization.	3	3		3																					
1355	3	In ''Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,'' by Joe Kurmaskie, the author depicts the vivid details of the setting and how they contribute to the cyclist�s condition. For example, the author wrote �Over one long, crippling hill, a building come into view. I wiped the sweat from my eye� The way the author described the hill as �crippling� should how much energy it was taking away from the cyclist. Another quote that contributed to the cyclist�s journey was, �that smoky blues tune ''Summer time� rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain.� This expressed how dehydrated the summer heat way making him. I believe the author used modifying details to support the description of the cyclist�s condition. I think the description of the setting enhanced the reader�s perception of the cyclist�s journey.   	3	2		3																					
1356	3	The terrain the cyclist faces don�t help very mach considering he is almost out of water, he came across hills that ticed himout a lot & made him even more thirsty. Also, when we came across the juice factory he used a lot of energy to get there because he was excited and that made him even more thirsty. Therefore if he didn�t have any energy left after all of that he wouldn�t have been able to get to the baits shop.	2	2		2																					
1357	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. First of all he is in the middle of no where, and he doesn�t know the direction of where he is going, and he also doesn�t know the people who live there. The other thing is that he doesn�t have a food, or a drink, so without eating or drinking he can�t get energy, so he can�t ride the bike.	1	1		1																					
1358	3	The features in the setting in the story afects the cyclist in many ways. For example in the story it said, �At same point, tumple weed crossed my path.� This is saying that he is in the desert or somewhere very hot because I know that you usually only see tumple weeds in very hot places. Thus, being in the desert affect the cyclist because he is already low on water then being  in a place as hot as the desert made him get even nor dehydrated. Another feature in the setting in this story that affected the cyclest is the hills he had to climb. This affected him because he was already  dehydrated and climbing hills made him have to work more which caused him to lose more sweat and become even more dehydrated. Those are two examples of how the features in the setting of this story affected the cyclest.	2	2		2																					
1359	3	The setting in this story is very hard for the cyclist. His main problem is the lack of water. If you deprive the body of water all of your major organs will bake in the hot sun. Another problem was the condition of the terrain. It is very hard to cycle on bumpy dry land. These are any a few problems the cyclist encountered.	2	2		2																					
1360	3	The feature in the setting affeted the cyclist alot. It was a hot summer day and he was running out of water. With oll the heat he could have had a heat stroke. Another problem was the hills. He didn't have alot of energy, ?? the sun were tiding it from him.	1	1		1																					
1361	3	The features of the setting affected the cycles beceuse it was hot and was a mough train.	1	1		1																					
1362	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as he gets closer to the nearest town  the ground becomes rougher to ride on. Like when he sees the sign saying not to exceed the limit. That shows that the ground is going to be rough.	1	1		1																					
1363	3	The features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead� negatively affect the cyclist. In the California desert, water is everything. If you run out of water then you might as well have run out of life. Without water, dehydration kicks in and it affects not only your body, but your mind too. The cyclist only had a limited amount of water with him when he started. �I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� Through the deserted towns he came across, he searched for a source of water but found none that were useable.� When I tried a drop or two ,it had the flower of battery acid.� @CAPS1 feature was the heat. It began to mess with his mind and take toll on his body quickly.� I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� He worned about heatstroke and his bodys need for water throughout the entire trip. Finally, in the deserts of California, wildlife can affect you. The cyclist was using a path that nature had claimed  and was not traveled often by people � crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement.� As you can see, the cyclist was negatively afftected by the features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead.�	3	3		3																					
1364	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because if there is a rough road ahead your just going to have to be able and to handle the up and downs, bumps. The author was scared that he was gonna die and that the birds were gonna pick his bones clean.	1	1		1																					
1365	3	In the story the cyclist faces many issues that could stop him from not finishing his journey. First, his water supply could cause him to become dehydrated and he could pass out. Another issue is the hot weather in June, which could cause him to a heat stroke and literally die. The rough terrain could stop him from finishing the trip because he could pop a bike tire and would have to walk. The cyclist faces many problems that could end his trip and maybe even life, but pushs through and survives.	1	1		1																					
1366	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cool pines keep the sun from beating down on him and from getting heatstroke. Another way is that the towns he he went to had either bad as or no water and he was becoming dehydrated. The heat from the sun was make him feel funny, he was hoping he wasn't seeing mirages.	1	1		1																					
1367	3	The cyclist does most really like the setting of the road. It�s messing up big time	0	0		0																					
1368	3	The setting is a desert in California in June, this affects the cyclist because it is very hot and he only has a couple drinks of water. There is no place for the cyclist stop and get more water. He says, �there is no one in sight, not a building,car, or structure of any kind.� As you can see that kind of setting would definetly affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1369	3	Some feature on the setting that @MONTH1 have affected the cyclist was the fact that he was running out of water and when he pumped water he said he pumped with all his strenght at first a tar like substance oozed out follwed by brackish water he said the water tasted of battery acid. Also in this setting the cyclist notices a terrain change flat road then turned short hills , follwed by a snake that looked od a diamond back.	1	1		1																					
1370	3	In the essay �Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� By Joe Kurmaskie. The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was on a bike and it was hot he ran into bumpy roads, and hills. For example he says �Not June miles into the next section of the road. He noticed the terrains changing. Flat land was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 example is �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that he could die from heatstroke.� These examples show that it was not easy and how the features affected the cyclist. In conclusion this story shows that you should never take directions from a old person, exspecially if its hot and you are riding a bike.	1	1		1																					
1371	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. To start with, the terrain of the road turned from flat bumpy which caused the cyclist to have an easy trip. In the story it said, ""Rough Road ahead do not exceed posted speed limit."" Since the cyclist had to use a lot more energy on the roads and his water supply was limited, he became very thirsty when he finally say an old town ahead, he stopped and it looked like it was a bandoned he began to pump water out of the water pump and no matter how long it pumped for it looked like battery acid. The quote  from the story said, ""when I tried a drop or two, it hard the flavor of battery acid,� that is some features of the setting that affected the cyclist throughout his journey."	2	2		2																					
1372	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly. The cyclist is cycling in a desert, �...I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 it was hot and the sun is beating down on the cyclist, �the sun was beginning to beatdown...� @CAPS1 it is remote and there is no one to offer help or assistance, �...it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.� There are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles of water. He might have died from dehydration. �I got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tarlike substance oozed out.� There @CAPS1 was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bit the cyclist. @CAPS1, there were hills that required more energy to get up. Since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty.	2	2		2																					
1373	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist�s attitude towards the old men. Since the cyclist listened to the old mens directions he was furious with himself. Seeing that the last attempt of direction had caused the cyclist to become nearly delicious, the setting had added severly to the problem. The beating sun and high desserts in California in the middle of June made the cyclist dehydrated and tired. When he come to a rusted water pump �black tar oozed out, you can picture the cyclist as furious and anxious and of course thirsty. The rough terrain and tumble weeds had caused the cyclist to feel skeptical of his decision to follow the old mens-directions.	3	2		3																					
1374	3	The cyclist in �Rough Road @CAPS1; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� starts off in the �serenity of an easly summer evening� taking road advice from old-timers. At first when the sun was beating down on him, he didn�t mind; the thoughts of Yosemite kept him determined. Later however, his determination was fading as he realized that his �short cut� was not so short after all. The �high deserts of California in June� and the terrain changed furthered his dehydration and need to find water. The emptiness of his surrounding with �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind� made him focus on the horizon and tell himself that if he made it there, the he�d be alright. Finally, a building came into view. The hope he got from this gave him strength to move on. Ironically it was an abandoned building. The cyclist describes it as a �Welch�s Grape Juice factory and bottling plant.� @CAPS2 this he had lost hope and hung his head. Believing he was going to die, the cyclist got back on his bike. Driving away from the factory, he saw a sight of a fish camp and immediately regained hope. Going there, he regained his strength and learned his lesson, never take road advice from other people.  	3	3		3																					
1375	3	The setting in the reading affected the cyclist because it was hot, dry, and nothing around. Being hot was one part of the setting that affected him because he had to drink water a lot. It was dry every where around him so he couldn�t stop anywhere and cool off. Also when things got hard there was nothing around but ghost towns and abandoned buildings. This is how the setting affected him.	1	2		2																					
1376	3	The features mentioned in the settings of the story made it harder for the cyclist. The lack of water during a summer in California  made it very uncomfortable for the cyclist to go through the deserts. The worst part was when he tried to suck the pebbles to cycle his saliva in his mouth, he ended up swallowing one.	1	1		1																					
1377	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation. The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with. 	1	1		1																					
1378	3	I think that if we where to inforce the punishments on those who speed that there wuold be less car crashes really those that have bad road rage shuold be in anger management	0	0		0																					
1379	3	"There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feature included the first ghost town that he come by. �but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut haven�t peen out for awhile. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a ""desert in California in June."" The cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water. The hills also had an affect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water. The Welch�s building also had an affect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the National Park."	2	2		2																					
1380	3	The cyclist see his journey affect by a succesion of events that will make his journey trave?? every time more difficul and difficult. One of the first errors his makes is take advice from people that have no clue of where there are at. @CAPS1 (I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map.) The temperature of the desert also influenced him (I was travelling through high desert of California). The  cyclist also finds his' self with a combination of emotions at times he thinks he is going to past away and at times he believes he will be fine. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) As i stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drunk deeply from the sink, I thought i had a over whelming wigs to seek Gary.	2	3		3																					
1381	3	"The features of the start affected the cyclist by going listing to so dyhrate who have not left town pours in this instead of following his name got him going in the middle like the start sites on the sreach make right site at the ??.???? the what he steal inside that ""I reached myself riht then that I'd always asked to it????????? find on the last ?? is the bitter. this is said ?? he did not  ?? the sight and felt he walking not make, fall on the ?? and get dust stick. Did he ??? want to happen gian so be ?? to always look at the map.     "	1	2		2																					
1382	3	In the story, The man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. He faces many obsticales in the story. For example, he has gone about @NUM1 miles without water. Also, their are a lot of hills and turns withen the story which slow him down He is having a hard time getting to water because of many obsticals	1	1		1																					
1383	3	In the story the cyclist is on a bike ride to @LOCATION1. He has a new map is doing very well, until he asks these old men the best way to get there taking less time and by getting these faster a.k.a a short at. He takes there directions and feels good abut it. But soon things change, he experiences new terrain and it becomes much harder. The type of setting that he faces are steep hills, speed limits that he can�t exceed, dry hot temperature, and he has no water. All these features combine together to make the situation worse. While he is experiencing these things he feels like he is going to die and feels like giving up. But eventually he finds someone and doesn�t ask for directions. So the lession is don�t take directions from a stranger unless your willing to face the unexpected. 	3	2		3																					
1384	3	The features affected the cyclist because of the rough roads. This affected him because it slowed him down, I know this because in the story it said �Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit�. which this means slow down or you will have an accident. Another feature has it was hot which means he was losing water because it either evaporated or he was drinking it. I know this because it said �The water bottles contained  water a few tantalizing sips� which means it was few left.	2	1		2																					
1385	3	The settings affect the cyclist in many ways on the way to Yosemite. Well for one when he took the shortcut, one thing that already made it difficult was that it was June, and he�s out in the desert. Also it says how he went to a couple towns that were deserted so there was no way to replenish his water. It says, �I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn�t cool down. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� @CAPS1 thing about his setting that changed was the hills.  But once he came to a bait shop, the old man asks  him if he  knows the best way to get to Yosemite, and he responds, �yes- sir: I own a very good map.� @CAPS2 by this he�s understood that the best way to travel anywhere is the path or road he knows because he�ll know what to expect. This is how the setting changed.	3	2		3																					
1386	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of the ways are that it is affecting him is that the discription of it makes it seem hotter then what it really is. He says �neihbor hood of two hundred degrees.� He is saying that it is really hot. The features of the setting affected him because I mad it seem hoter and he was taking it to far.	1	1		1																					
1387	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The cyclist used words to discribe the setting like �flat road� and �short, rolling hills�, There were also more example. The way the cyclist discribed the setting gave the reader a visual picture. I think the cyclist was affected by the setting.	1	1		1																					
1388	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, depending how the main character feels, that�s what the setting is like. When he got the next town and left he was feeling well because nothing was going wrong. The setting was very tranquil. The narrator says, �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them�(Kurmaskie). This setting was very happy and pleasant just like the narrators mood.	1	1		1																					
1389	3	Some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replace by short, rolling hills. Then he came to a rough road. Another obstacle from the cyclist was the tar-like substance that came out the rusted water pump followed by brackish water feeling somewhere of @NUM1 hundred degrees. Everytime he pumped it wouldn�t cool down and the water tasted like battery acid. He was hitting his water bottle regularly that is why he needed new water. The cyclist was travelling through the high deserts of California and the sun was starting to beat down so he was dehydrated. The snake blocked the pavement in front of him that looked like diamond back.  	2	2		2																					
1390	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� The getting of the story is, �a reservoir campground outside of @CAPS1, California� during the early summer. Being the early summer in souther California, the temperatures are going to be hot. And the main character, who is a cyclist and is doing a lot of physical activity, is a going to sweat a lots. The temperature and excessive sweating cause the cyclist to drink a lot of water. The water runs out and we are now it our conflict. The setting also reads the main character to his resolution of the conflict. Being by a reserveir, fishing is going to be a popular activity. A bait and tackle shop would be the perfect business to have, since there who is at bait and tackle shop, the cyclist could go inside a quinch his thirst. Therefore, the setting of the story affect affects the conflict and the solution.	3	3		3																					
1391	3	The cyclist decided to ride to Yosemite National Park during a hot summer day in California. His first instincts was to use a perfectly good map that was up to date. Then he started having a conversation with some old me who decided that they would tell him a short cut they took back in the day. The cyclist decided to take the old�s men�s short cut through the desert with one meschy bottle of water. It was really hot out side and the sun was scorging down on his back while he was riding his bike. This made him hotter than he ??? and there was no shade are place for him to top and get some water. This made the trip harder for him because now he was focused on finding water and not on his ride. The settings of the cause effected the cyclist in many ways he was not prepared for the route, and the route he took was not biker friendly. If he would have took the route that was on the map then he would have know where he was and his ride would not have been affected by thoughts of slowing down to put rocks in the moth to reserve water or thoughts of finding water he would 	3	3		3																					
1392	3	"The cyclist a had rough time. The elements were against him. It was dry and hot and he had no water. In the text it says,""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. ""This shows that he had hardly any water, and what he did have would only make him thirster. ""@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. ""It was obviously not and the quote maker you visualize a desert or colorado. The man was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind. He was saving up his energy and his water. He was starting to go a little crazy. The hills were killer for him, in the text it says ""over one long, crippling hill."" This show you now rough the conditions were because he told us in the begining that he is a cyclist. The biker hell a very rough time and the setting definity effects this. "	2	3		3																					
1393	3	The wether can change the corse of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold out side then the cyclist will bring beveyer cloths if its. Hoter out side he would most likly bring lighter clothes. If he was riding farther hed bring more supplys like water and food If he was going on a short rid then he wouldn�t bring so much stuff. The way the wether is changes the way a person will prepaire,	1	1		1																					
1394	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the different aspects of the setting effect the cyclist in several ways. When he first begins he doesn�t even notice how hot it is and he says, �the ran was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� His mood starts to change very quickly. Soon he drinks most of his water of becomes increasingly tired. He finds a water pump which irriates him when he realize the water tastes like �battery acid.� As he continues he sees a snake which he could swear was a diamond back so he slowly goes by out. When he notices a factory he uses his last bit of energy to reach it only to be discouraged when he finds it abandone. His spirits finally rise when he finds a store and drinks a good amount of water.	2	2		2																					
1395	3	Multiple parts of the setting effect the cyclist; When he arrives in a town with a water pump, but this pump doesn�t have good water, �when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This part of terrain shows its effect. When he becomes very dehydrated, �in my dehydrated state� (kurmaskie @NUM1). Another part of the setting that effected the cyclist was when he arrived at the juice factory and it was closed which depressed him.	2	2		2																					
1396	3	The cyclist in this short story was greatly affected by the setting. He was riding in a desert which is very hot, with little civilization to help him. Also the rode that was driving on was not very smooth which gave him troubles. The wildlife also had an impact on him. He once went by a big snake that he cautiously had to ride around. Also he thought he was going to die and that the birds were going to pick him off. The desert itself was what really got to hm. Deserts don�t have much water which is what he needed and he couldn�t find a town to stop at, at least one with some people any way. So the setting in which the main character was riding had a huge effect on him.	2	2		2																					
1397	3	The cyclist was exhausted as he was going up hill. The setting of story affects the cyclist alot. This is because in California it is really good to be cycling. The weather is warm and perfect for a town. It had one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral that could not hold in the lamest mule greeted him.Besides that, after riding twenty miles ahead, there was a terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. After he crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at him. The rough road was the time where he had to be really careful and not to exceed the speed limit.	2	1		2																					
1398	3	The setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist. These settings discourage him, although he tries to keep hope. Seeing dry desert, hills begin to heighten, nothing man-made is in sight. These subconsciously affect the cyclist and his growth of thirst. To one point the cyclists original objective became invalidated for his thirst pangs and exhaustion.	1	2		2																					
1399	3	Being a cyclist is not as easy as it sounds. Sure riding a bike might be easy, but being a cyclist is so much more difficult. Cyclist have many obsticles to over come while riding. One obstacle would be a rough terrain. Cyclist are used to riding on smooth, paved roads. Going off � road or riding on a dirt road might be a challenge. In the short story �Do Exceed posted Speed Limit�, by Joe Kurmaskie also has another example for an obsticle cyclist have to be careful of, and that is running out of water, �I eased past, trying to keep by balance in my dehydrated state� (@CAPS1 @NUM1). The cyclist went on in telling how he needed to try to keep his balance but it was hard because he was dehydrated, and balancing is important when riding a bike. In conclusion when it comes to as easy as riding a bike, you need to take precaution in what might lie ahead.	2	2		2																					
1400	3	The setting affects the cyclist in many ways. It makes him feel hopeful, determined, alone, and completely exhausted. The desert- like terrain leaves him feeling very tired and thirsty. The bumpy road is hard to pedal over, and the endless stretches of land make him feel as if the next town is years away. While travelling, the cyclist recalls �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake . blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me� (Kurmaskie, @NUM1).The tumbleweeds are a symbol of dry desert death. They remind the cyclist he is completely alone in a vast stretch of sand and rocks. Were the snake in the path to poison him he�d not only under the beaty sun until some other unfortunate cyclist found him. However, later on when he sees the sign for Gary and Wilber�s fish camp, the hope is restored back to him. He is yet again determined because waiting somewhere near is the water he needs to keep him alive. In the end, the setting helped him to safely feel the hope deep inside of him.	3	3		3																					
1401	3	"The feateres of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example ""not two mlles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changin. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills. ""This affected the cyclist because he had to pedal  harder to go up the hills and he got short of breath due to this. Another example  is, ""At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a rediculously large snake-it really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� This affected the cyclist because he had to wait for the snake to move so it didnt bite him while he crossed it. One last example is, ""As I stumbled into a rather modem bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1 and Wilber� This had an affect on the cyclist because he was now hapy to have water and have reached his destination."	2	2		2																					
1402	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he saw �short, rolling hills,� tumbleweeds� and �a ridiculously large shake,� and he thought that he was not getting anywhere.	1	1		1																					
1403	3	Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story.	1	1		1																					
1404	3	The rider was affected by two men giving him wrong directions. The rider followed their advice instead of taking the right way he ended up taking the long way. He was getting very thribiy. He also came face to face with a snake. Then he finally found the nearest town in got help.	1	1		1																					
1405	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are. The hills that the cyclisit has to go over and the heat. The heat is making the cyclist sweat alot so he is loosing fluids and he starts to got dyhydrated. The hills are making him have to work harder and getting more tired.	1	1		1																					
1406	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They affected his confidence, his energy, and his determination. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident. This is show when he says.� The cool pined and rushing rivers of yosemite has my name written all over them. This shows confidence because he knows he can make it to yosemite.When he runs out of water he begins to lose confidence and thinks he way die. Since he ran out of water because of the heat, his energy is also dropped. You know he�s running out of water when he says.�The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, after lose of water and confidence; he actually had higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive. As you can see the cyclist was affected in many ways by the features of the setting.	3	2		3																					
1407	3	Many things that the author talks about in the story affect him: One example in the oldmen that give him advice. They tell him that they know a great shortcut which turns into the authors hardest ride ever. Another example is: the heat, the location, time of day, and time of the year. In California, in @DATE1 in the dessert will give you lots of heat. In order to beat this heat you need lots of water which is one of his biggest problems. He runs out of water. Another hindering thing he discovers is the abandoned welches grape juice building where he sees a picture of a boy drinking a refreshing glass of grape juice. All these combined gave the author a hard time but in the end he found a bait and tackle shop where he was saved	2	2		2																					
1408	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead Do not exceed posted speeed limit,� the cyclist is affected by features of the setting. In the story it says �The sun was beginning to beat down. �This quote means that it was getting hotter and this was going to make it harder for the cyclist to ride. Another quote that states that the features of the setting affects the cyclist is �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This means that the cyclist is cold not only going to have to deal with the heat, but he is also going to have to side-over hill after hill. Eventhough they @MONTH1 be small, rolling hills, it still takes alot of energy out of you to ride up and down hills repeatedly. A third quote that shows the setting affecting the cyclist is �I got down on my hands and knes, walking the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substance oozed out, followed  by brackish water feling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees �this quote means the cyclist is so desperate to get water, that he uses his small amount of strength left to try and get some water. When he finally does get some water, it first come out as an ooey substance then the water come out really hot. In conclusion, these have been examples of how the cyclist was affected by features of the setting. 	2	3		3																					
1409	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the sharp turns and the lonelyness it say in the text �About forty miles into the pedal. I arrived at the first town.�	1	1		1																					
1410	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly because there was tough terrain. The heat had affected him greatly as well. He seemed that every where he would go, he couldn�t find anything, no buildings or people until he got that one town. In the story, �Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist qoutes.�At same point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� @CAPS1 your bike on the middle of the desert, not knowing which way to go and only seeing  harsher conditions can only give you no hope .He soon almost ran out of water only made things worst.The sun beating down on him and his mind playing tricks on him also, so with the cyclist , settings had alot to do with his journey.	3	3		3																					
1411	3	The features the cyclist experianced during his ride affect his body and mind. At first the cyclist was on flat graund, drinking plenty of water and without fear. But when he came to his second town, he became ton on water. This troubled him, but he was optomistic telling himself �the next town was only eighteen miles.� After this the road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� this started to trouble him. Dehydration started to set him and every hill was a challenge. Once out of water he sucked on pebbles and hopped it would �take your mind off of thirst.� When he finally made it, he was so relieved. Everything from dehydration, wich affects the body to lozing hope affected the cyclist on his ride	3	2		3																					
1412	3	The conditions in the California desert were horrible for a cyclist. The temperature was extremely high and the humidity was very dry. The roads also had a lot of hills and when a cyclist has to use his energy in the heat to go up and down hill after hill, it can be very hard. There were also no stops to refill his water a long the way,which is bad because the neat,lack of water,and all of his energy extension leads to major dehydration.The conditions along this trip are not good for a cyclist and can be very dangerous.	2	2		2																					
1413	3	The setting of the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed posted speed limit� affected the cyclest greatly. He was riding through a desert in June. This meant that the temperature was very high. The narrator even states �I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� @CAPS1 feature of the setting that affected him were the hills. He even calls them	1	1		1																					
1414	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because he knows he�s in the wrong area. The cyclist understand's that he should have never took that advice from them old men. So he was upset and new he should have taken his advise. The cyclist had a feeling that he wasn�t supposed to take it that way he said he shouldn�t have let them take a peek at his map. So the features really affect him.	1	1		1																					
1415	3	In �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie the main character faces a lot of trouble. First people give him the wrong directions. But, worst of all he has to travel a lot of mile on a bike through extreme temperatures. Going up and down hills and pedaling really hard. He doesn�t even have any cool water. As the character says, ��followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (kurmaskie @NUM1). That kind of water didn�t help him either. It didn�t quench his thirst because it was so hot, he said it tasted like battery acid. But, finally he worked up his confidence and kept pedalig till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool water. Then he headed off to Yosemite and didn�t take anyone�s advice.	3	2		3																					
1416	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist. The setting was a desert in California making it VERY hot outside. The hills were hard to climb and there were dangers all around such as poisonous snakes. Not just this was terrain hard to move around on but the path was thickest. �@CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� This made it harder for the cyclist to reach his destination.	2	1		2																					
1417	3	In the towns that the cyclist arrived at were all ghost towns. In the text, the author said, �it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� It affected the cyclist because, with the towns being deserted, the cyclist couldn�t refill hi water.	1	1		1																					
1418	3	The cyclist was motivated to get the job done. When they   said only �    eighteen miles down the road.� He thought it was going to be forever but he made it because he �conserved his water ...� and last kept on going, when the road   turned into a rocky gravel road, he still kept on going, but it was harder on his legs and water supply.	1	1		1																					
1419	3	The condition the cyclist are in calls for a lot of preparation. The cyclist was in a hot desert area with winding road and hills. The cyclist need to have plenty of water to make it where he is going, and, as read in the story, the conditions almost caused @CAPS1 health to the man who was trying to ride through.	1	1		1																					
1420	3	Setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� really determines how the story turns out. The setting was in deserted areas, the desert, and even roadways. In the desert, there is no water making the cyclist become dehydrated. without water, he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits was extremly high fifty-five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing  � a water-depleting @NUM1.� When he finds areas that are abandoned, these are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like �battery acid.� Setting can affect alot in the story. Without this setting, the story would be alot different than it is now.	3	2		3																					
1421	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist had a couple of problems turning his journey little, amount of water, tough roads, including there were no cars on the road either. It all caused a lot of difficulty for the cyclist like on page @NUM1 paragraph one the first sentence �It didn�t really matter. In was going to die and the birds would pick me down� The elements were so tough on the cyclist that he or she was going to going to give hope. But luckly in the end the cyclist found a place to stop and get water with directions.	1	2		2																					
1422	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. He is trying to get water but when he tried the pump, �a tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees�. The cyclist doesn�t have any water so it is difficult to go on. He could suffer from heat exhaustion. As he came to the next town, he found, �the building - abandoned years earlier, had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant�. He is still thinking of getting to the next town to get something to drink. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1423	3	In the story there were many features of the setting tha affected the cyclist. One that had the greatest impact was that it was dry and hot, and that the terrain was very rough in the desert. Being that it was dry and hot made his ride hard. For example, the heat caused him to get dehydrated on his journey and begin to feel signs of heatstroke. The terrain caused an even bigger dilema. For example, in the story him riding through that terrain causes him to get tired and become even more dehydrated than he already is.   	2	2		2																					
1424	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. First is the emptiness, the feeling that he is all alone. Nor a car, person  or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone. That it would be along while before  anyone would be able to  find him. Nor that  might ecase some, But I think dalved him even more. It gave him that extra boost of energy that seems  to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of animal. The desert environment is very, unforgiving. The sun beats down like your only person on the plannet. The lack of water the food that it hasn�t rained in decades. The never ending, @CAPS1 road. The ups and downs and all the animals that await him. The fact that if he stops at all, ever, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment that is explained in the text has alot to do with the cyclist and affects him a great deal.  	2	3		3																					
1425	3	The setting of this short story affects the cyclist by making him dehydrated and dies. Also in the setting he found the abandon factory which makes him feel hopeless. If the setting was elsewhere then this setting he would have felt different as he didn�t  meet the people  of the reserve he could have been in the better roads than the old roads he was in	1	1		1																					
1426	3	The countries of the setting that had the most effect on the cyclist were the deserts and hills. The author tells us first of his depleting water supply as he journeys through the high deserts of California in June. �The hills had a major effect on him because the intensive host that any desert contains, with this heat, his limited water, and the fact that it was June. I�m sure the author was most a happy person traveling within his intensive journey. Another misfortune that the author explains is the touring changing.� That road was replaced by a host rolling hills. �With my own experience, I know these cannot be a worse kind. Tall steep hills are a difficult climb, but your a living house the luxurious most to cool. In his mind too with, the author�s �Short, rolling hills�, the climb gets more miserable with every hill, and the coast down the other side barely cools your bare skin, leaving your thiving soul to continue in this dep pain. I�m sure the cyclist was experiencing a burned out spirit after just a few of those deadly hills.    	3	3		3																					
1427	3	"The features of the setting have affected the cyclist in �Do not exceed posted speed limit"" greatly, first he statrs off happy because he�s going to Yosemite national park and he�d gotten short cut advice that would make his trip shorter. ""He rode into the morning with strong legs,� Then he got to the first stop. It looked like a buzzing town at one time, but now a ghost town. So he kept on with plenty of water and thought he could make it to the next stop. The next stop was an old abandoned gas station where the only water was @NUM1. He was hitting the water pretty regular and the hot sun was beating down on him. The next terrain changed he thought he would die & have the vultures pick his bones because he took advice from old timers, then became to his next stop which seemed to be an old welch�s grape juice factory. He thought he would die of thirst but he kept on with little water a hot sun. next the hills came & he paced himself a little time, then he finally came to a modern looking place with cool running water with an old man who gave him directions that he gladly took. After that he been through asuring himself he would die he was relieved to see the old man�s there he would forever on listen to their advice because he made it."	1	1		1																					
1428	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because someone travelling a good distance in California during June will be hot. If the cyclist doesn�t have enough water to supply himself for if he gets lost then the features of the setting are very crucial. Not having enough water can cause someone to dehydrate, which does happen to the cyclist in the essay. �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. �This statement proves that the cyclist wasn�t a good state to be lost when the sun is blazing down on him. Also, when you are dehydrated and tired you @MONTH1 start to see things that aren�t there, but you want to see those things. � I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. �It was a good decision that the cyclist didn�t get his hopes up about a building that might not be there overall, features of a setting for a cyclist can cause anything to happen, so be careful.	2	2		2																					
1429	3	"The features of the setting extremely affect the adjust in the ride to the meet town. It was bad enough that the adjust the out of water but on top of that by faced, rolling wills, makes and hard road condition all of these setting played a huge will in the cyclist puformance, ""it motued the terrain changing. that way was replaced by that rolling hills."" He also says ""tumbleweed around my matt and a includesouly change snake it really did look like a demand luck blocked the majority of the movement in front of me. These setting made it difficult for the adjust to reform because the hills snakes and tumbleweed disturbed the adjust to advanced in the ride. He ran out of water no it was hard to reduce up will and the night of a deadly snake made the adjust named and worked to the difficulty of pufornenance for the cyclist"	2	3		3																					
1430	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist was like saying you are old and that you know nothing at all. But it is not true. It means you are older and that your information @MONTH1 not be correct for example in the essay when he was on his way to the town he learned to use his map instead of a guys opinion because the guy was wrong.	1	1		1																					
1431	3	The first town the cyclist came to was like a ghost town because there was nobody was there. The next town wasn�t any better because it was @NUM1 miles down the road. The cyclist faced some problems while on the journey. Some of these problems included snakes - The fact that he wos running out of water- the hill-and the condition of the road.	2	2		2																					
1432	3	The features of the setting in �DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� affect the cyclist in a negative way. The terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling. Considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well, he begins to struggle. The author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as, tumbleweed, snakes and lack of water. The fact that the author is running out of water, makes continuing on a very stressful. He is worried that he will die of dehydration before he ever reaches Yosemite National Park. Finally, with much strength and determination, he reaches a fish a Fish camp. He is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on.	3	2		3																					
1433	3	The   features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a hot of dry place and has no water. He is pedaling up hills and that makes him even more tired. The dude is probably dehydrated and   his  conditions   are getting worse!	1	1		1																					
1434	3	The features of the settings affects the cyclist a lot in the passage called  �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�. Cyclist are in very good physical shape. They can cycle for along time; however, weather can affect the cyclist. This happened in the passage. The cyclist was determined and confident he could make this journey. �I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Even though he had confidence the features of the setting affected the cyclist. �Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�.�. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips�. The cyclist was tired and exhausted. The weather and terrain had worn him down. The weather can change my level of ability sometimes. I love to play basketball outside. When it is hot and humid out I can�t play as long. The features of a setting can clearly affect people.	3	2		3																					
1435	3	During this bikers adventure heat and lack of water affect him. In this short story when the cyclist feels lost he says �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� This suggests that the rider was faced with the extreme heat of the desert during his ride. He also says �The water bottles contained only a few tantilizing sips.� This quote shows that not only was he faced with the heat, but also with lack of water. These facts and quotes show the clear threats this biker faced on his long bike-ride.	2	2		2																					
1436	3	The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble. Because of the lack of water, not only might be die but he begins to see mirages. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isn�t good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic can�t help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, they�re landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
1437	3	The setting which is a desert in the summer affects the cyclist. For example, she caldn�t go as fast, �The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,� so that affected his ability to find water. The setting was also really hot, so the cyclist had a hard time getting the water he needed to keep going. For example, �I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn�t cool down.� @CAPS1 how the setting has got on to him, and he needs water badly. The desert setting also affects the cyclist mind. He believed he was seeing mirages and he was afraid he was going to swallow a stone because he might hit a bump. The desert setting affects the cyclist ability to function.  	2	2		2																					
1438	3	"In the story �Rough Road Ahead� the features of the setting affect the cyclist. At points the setting mode the author feel depressed and sad and at other times, happy and joyful. For example, the cyclist was pedaling and pedaling with nothing in sight. In twenty miles he saw camp ?? a ?? that he was thirsty and had holes. When he pumped the water, no  come out. These part of the setting gave the cyclist a bad affect. The cyclist gave ""teaches life can be so cruel"" He obviously had a bad effect if he thought life was being cruel At some point in the story the setting be a good affect on the reader. He is able to die of thirst when he sees a bait shop. This puts the cyclist in a good mood because he said �my troubles thirst and feels he all behind me� different settings in the story gave the author a different affect. "	2	3		3																					
1439	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didn�t seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� He didn�t know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride.	3	3		3																					
1440	3	"The cyclist was riding in the hot, desert. This made him thirsties and less active. The story says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt."""	1	1		1																					
1441	3	My point of view that affect a cyclist that people need to recycle sometimes people is throwing away trash can with soda in side of it people cyclist now in days some times they need to change that role my conclusion people need to save stuff to make some new things to make a good quality world of cyclist things.	0	0		0																					
1442	3	The cyclist listen to the geogers. after a while he starts to get tired. After the seenery desert change he starts to get mad. He criticizes himself for accepting advice from �old-timers who haven�t left the	2	2		2																					
1443	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the �fork of sorts� as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn�t. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third ""obstacle"" he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still with a smile on his face."	3	3		3																					
1444	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist because of his enduranc. The amount of time he can ride without stopping, houever long he can ride up hill, how ever many bumps he rides over, however long he can ride without a drink of water.	1	1		1																					
1445	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the changes the occur while riding his bike. The cyclist began well with smily face, but then he changed because the condition of the road and the weather that was hot, also there was not any signal to show him where he was going and it was the correct way he was taking. Also, his bike flat needed to be replaced.	1	1		1																					
1446	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by for the roads and heat has. He has tine ling through a desert in June which made it really hot for him, @CAPS1 that the road was bumpy and that made him have to pedal harder.  The @CAPS1 had to prit more effort into it because the romds here long and he had the spirit and determination to get to Yosemite. He @CAPS1 ran into a snake which told him that I am getting deeper into the desert.	2	2		2																					
1447	3	The setting of the cyclist clearly influences his mood. From the beginning to end, the outside world reflects the tormils in his head. This is evident in the beginning reservoir, empty desert, hills the Welch factory, & finally the fish camp. The reservoir is a heven, @NUM1 safe ground that contains everything the men needs. He is feeling optimistic, ready & eager to follow advice of old men. He first hits a ghost town, which is foreshadowing a dangerous future. He passes through still with a level head. He comes to a water pump that gives him battery acid. This is wher the mood shifts. He suddenly describes his setting as �the high deserts of California.� The sun is boiling down & water is running low. His hopes start to drop. When the �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� it reflects the turmoil in his head. The terrain is harder the chances of his survival lessons. When he crosses a snake, it suggest even more despair. It finally climaxes at the Welch factory. How ironic, it is an abandoned juice factory. This is lost hope. When he finally arrives at the fish camp, he is relieved to be alive & is uplifted. The cyclist has made it. It is clear the setting has affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
1448	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He is riding his bike along the road and encounters a dilema.�� @CAPS1 weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. Blocked the� pavement in front of me.� He had to stop and into by the snake which showed him down and freaked him out. He had problems with thirst already and had to deal with a snake that �really did look like a diamondback.� @CAPS2, he sees a building up ahead and discovers that it�s a walrus Grape Juice factory. He thought that is might have some water but realized it was abandoned. Relating to his thirst, before he left he grabbed some pebbles.� I�d read once that sucking on stones helps takes your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.� * @CAPS3 he came across a fishing camp and received instructions on how to go on. This affected him because he @CAPS3 got to a secure place and got proper directions and will learn from his mistake of listening to the older men at the beginning. The features of 	3	2		3																					
1449	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist by giving him hope that the finishing line is not far and there was nothing in sight no cars, building or stucture of any kind.	1	1		1																					
1450	3	The author was affected in many ways be the conclusion. He was tired from the blazing heat, didn�t have much water, and got lost. Water simple was limiting and as he went farther and farther it seemed like thing would get worser and worser for him. A man had gave him the wrong directions and he probably hadn�t been off his porch in decades the author saids.	2	2		2																					
1451	3	In the story the cyclist explains how the road goes from good to bad: An example,� Rough road ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed limit. Also the dry.	1	1		1																					
1452	3	"In the story, these are many elements that affected the cyclist in his journey.The first features of the setting that affects him is the old water pump, which did not work, and when it did the water from it lasted horrible. The next obstacles on his journey was rough terrain. ""Flat road  was replaced by short rolling hills,"" was how he described it. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be  abandoned. Eventually he finds a  town and rest after his long journey, and learns his lesson from before not to take advice from people he doesn�t know."	2	2		2																					
1453	3	Well the features were rough desert like features. For a cyclist this terrain is difficult. For example the lack of water, and the battery acid flavor. These affected the cyclist in a major way.	1	1		1																					
1454	3	'Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrian changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills'' (Kurmaskie @NUM1). When the cyclist realized the terrain was becoming difficulty he become more ignorant and hopeless. ''Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt; and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. it was a sad, hopeless laugh'' (@NUM1). He wasn't goig to die, die but even though he was struggling, he made a big deal out of it. Unfortunately, the man lived. He would live on, telling people not to listen to old men. ''Never accept travel advice from a collection of old timerd who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office'' (@NUM3). He was on a long, hot raod, and he started taking stabs at the old men ''I made a mental note to change that paragraph'' (@NUM4) The man was not forced to take direction from the old man. In his selfishness to cut back thos trip of only a few rough terrain, heat, and dehydration caused him to be hopeless,angry, and he felt sorry for himself.	3	3		3																					
1455	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist is traveling through the high deserts of California in June. Another affect said in the story was that the cyclist made it to a town where the water pump was all rusted and with all his strength, he worked the handle and got a tarlike substance followed by brackish water which he couldn�t drink. Also , the cyclist had been hitting his water bottles regularly. Lastly, the old-timers said the towns would be close when really they were far apart.	2	2		2																					
1456	3	There are many things that can affect a cyclist's journey. This cyclist seemed to have bad wick. He starts off mentioning that he is planning a trip to Yosemite and the men that hear this give him a tip. The cyclist is pretty confident in what they tell him, so he follows their suggestions. He ends up getting lost. The cyclist is also travelling in the �high deserts of California in June.� That means that he is travelling in summer with dry air. When he gets to the first �town� he sees, he can it get the water he needs to rehydrate his body. He also runs into a snake while travelling through the desert, which slows him down. Because it�s hot, and he�s tired, he begins to see mirages that affect him. All of these features cause the cyclists to take one long, tiring journey through the desert. These features also taught him the lesson to not take advise from old men who have not left their porch because their information @MONTH1 be out of date.	2	2		2																					
1457	3	Well the setting was the lil boy was on the bike and he meets this old man and the man toke him a short cut. So he took dis road and I guess something went wrong.	1	1		1																					
1458	3	In the �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the main characters, the cyclist. After he first journied from the house where he met the old men, he rode over much flat desert terrain, where the sun beat down and dehydrated him. Soon, though the terrain changed. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This tests his endurance even more as he has to maneuver down the hills while dehydrated and ready to collapse from exhaustion.	2	2		2																					
1459	3	Hot, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink. He will get dehydrated. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structur of any kind. Finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road. So he had to move around it.	2	2		2																					
1460	3	Seting is one of the most important neds for a cyclist if the terrein or weather are bad, the hotter it is for a cylist its ?? ??	1	1		1																					
1461	3	The The features of the setting effect the cyclist because the cyclist @CAPS1 challenging porblem face by the author. Forexample, I nottice the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had erected the first few things, a large highway. That�s shows when he arrived, the road does not good and also large highway high of jumped.	1	1		1																					
1462	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY IT BEING SO HOT OUTSIDE THAT HE COULD HAVE HAD PASSED OUT AND DIED. ALSO HE SAW A SNAKE THAT SCARED HIM TO DEATH BUT HE PASSED THE SNAKE. ALSO HE SAW A BUILDING THAT COULD PROBABLY HELP HIM BUT IT WAS ABANDONED,IT WAS A WELCH FACTORY THEN AS HE RUNS FURTHER DOWN HE SAW A FISH PLACE AND WENT TO THE BATHROOM TO GET SOME WATER then somebody asked him where he was going and they tined totzy him but he still had his map so he decided that he was going to use it instead of listening to other people.	2	3		3																					
1463	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� a cyclist takes some out of rate information from a couple of old guys as he went along following there directions he found out that there directions were out of rate and at points dangerous. Also the setting didn�t help because he was in a desert with ghost towns and it was very hot it didnt help him believe he was going to make it out alive. For example in the story when he enters the  fork in the road it says he found �several rusty pumps,� and �one ramshackle shed.� This probably didnt help him because he didn�t have alot of water left and it was really hot and he was losing confidence in himslef that he went get out and there were rusty pumps so he couldn�t get any water that was good. Also in the story it says that �There was no one in sight, not a bulding, car, or structure of any kind� and that setting affected him because in this part in the story he has cycled for a while and he has no water left and he is getting very exhausted a almost has no energy. Also it decreased his hopes because it says there wasnt a building, or a car anything so it was pretty, much a empty dessert that he was stuck in and he thought he wouldn�t setent of the dessert alive. In conclusion in the story �Rough road ahead� the setting in the story didn�t help the cyclist in his hope or confiendce of setting out because the setting was very abanded and also it was very hot and it didn�t help that he was in a desert.	3	3		3																					
1464	3	"Well since the cyclist is in a desert and out of mother he is probably not going to be happy. The ""ghost towns"" aren't really a boost of confidence either. The rugged hills made him angry too. The heat affected him the most."	1	1		1																					
1465	3	The features of the land affect the cyclist in the many ways. For example, the first two buildings that he came to were abandond so he could not get any food or water. Also, he noticed that the terrain was changing from flat to rolling hills and this will put more strain on his legs. Finally, the land was hot and dry wich was making him dehidrated. This is how the features of the land affected the cyclist. 	1	1		1																					
1466	3	In this story the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. He tries to get directions but the people he asked really didnt know what they were talking about. Thats why you have to be careful on who you ask. Then he needs a drink but that dosent work out to well because the water ends up tasting like battery acid. Then the cyclist begins to be on his way again and finds same difficulty in the road. The same difficulty in the road. The road is in bad condition and must do slower then the speed limit. At this point it felt like he was gonna die. Lucky he found a bathroom and drank from the sink.	2	2		2																					
1467	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. Early in the essay, the syclist states he �enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers.� The cyclist was enjoying himself and the  atmosphere, but then the mood changed quickly to doubt when he didn't listen to the �collection of old-timers who havent left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office� and his depleting water source quickly became a cause for concern. Doubt was soon followed by @CAPS1 when he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp and was able to get a drink from the bathroom foucets @CAPS1 was then followed by satisfaction when he �promised himself right then that he'd always stick to [the very good map] in the future.   	2	3		3																					
1468	3	The setting had a bad affect on the author in many ways. One reason is that the heat of the setting caused the author become dehydrated. Dehydration is when your body begins to shut down due to lack of water. The setting also affected him by draining his confidence and making him seek out water. �I hung my head,� means that he was depressed. This proves that no matter who or what you follow there is always a possibility of death from any circumstances. Therefore this is how the author was affected by the setting he was biking @CAPS1.	2	2		2																					
1469	3	I think the settings made it little more challenging to not letting give up also. Also shows that you do better in life when challenged.	1	1		1																					
1470	3	The setting affects the cyclist because it is in a warm dry climate, causing him to sweat profusely, and requiring like to drink more water. When no one else was around, it is more difficult for him to continue, if there�s a chance that he is on the wrong path, and no body available to tell him otherwise. With only abandoned buildings, if any, water was unavailable, which made the journey more tiring and physically straining. If the setting were different, this story would not have been as traumatic.	2	2		2																					
1471	3	THERE ARE VAST FEATURES IN THE SETTING THAT AFFECTS THE CYCLIST. IN SEVERAL WAYS ONE FEATURE WOULD BE THE �SUN BEGINNING TO HEAT DOWN,� AS THAT MADE THE CYCLIST HOT AND THIRSTY. THE THIRSTY-NESS REDUFROM HIM TO USE HIS LIMITED SUPPLY OF WATER. SO THE SUN WAS ABLE TO EFFECT HIM A COUPLE OF WAYS. ANOTHER FEATURE THAT CAUSED SOME PROBLEMS FOR THE CYCLIST WERE THE RUN DOWN �GHOST TOWNS� THAT CONSISTS OF �RAM-SHACKLE SHEDS� AND �SEVERAL RUSTY PUMPS.� THESE FEATURES LED THE CYCLIST TO FEEL HOPELESSNESS, AS WELL AS THE PROBLEM THAT THEY DIN�T HAVE ANY WATCH FOR THEM TO FEEL UP WITH AS HE BECAME DEHYDRATED.  OBSTACLES SUCH AS �TUMBLEWEEDS� AND �PAVEMENT BLOCKING SNAKES� ALSO PLAYS A ROLE IN AFFECTING THE CYCLISTS AS HE MOVE ON THE �@NUM1 ROAD� ONLY DOING �12 MPH.� ONE FINAL, AND LAST OBSTACLE WAS THE TERRAIN HE RODE ON.  THE OBSTACLE BEING A �LONG CROPPING HILL,� THIS MADE THE CYCLIST EXHAUSTED, AS HE USES MUCH ENERGY TO SUMMER THE HELL, HE WAS ??? ???? ??? ???	3	2		3																					
1472	3	Topic: The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The features of the setting affect a cyclist or the major problem that a cyclist encounter are some rough road, inspection of the bike, putting on necessary equipment, do not exceed posted speed limit For a cyclist to be doing all this I don think there is going to be any features of the setting affect a cyclist. For a cyclist to maintaining the speed limit of @NUM1 or a water-depleting @NUM2: sometimes life can feel so cruel. At some point, tumbleweeds are caused by too much of speed but for them to be using the necessary equipment they won�t get seriously injured. Forget that old saying about never taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be �Never accept to	1	1		1																					
1473	3	The features of the setting really affected the cyclist. The author wrote of rough terrain and isolation. �Flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake�. After reading this information and the descriptions. I inferred that the author was alone in the desert with awful conditions. I go inferal a tone of resentment also. He seemed to wish he hadn�t taken the �shortcut� that landed him in the desert. The hot weather was another factor that affected the author, trying to keep my balance in a dehydrated state. He seems to have not really planned how long the ride would be and how to conserve water. The rough terrain desolation and hot temperatures seemed to have affected the cyclist / author.	2	3		3																					
1474	3	"The features of the setting that most affected the cyclist were the water pump, the Welch�s Factory, and the fish camp. The pump affected him because he was very thirsty, and at first he thought he would have a chance to get water, he was excited and he pumped the water out, as he wrote, �with all my strength.� @CAPS1 he had to go on thirsty, (a very risky thing to do while cycling) because �it had the flavor of battery acid.� Next, the Welch�s Factory affected him by killing his spirits. He was already feeling bad from the lack of water, but seeing the mocking, ironic image of �a sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice�, made him feel worse. It reflected his own desperate situation, all refreshments in the past, there was nothing left. I had a similar experience once. I am alergic to peanuts. One time, on a long car trip, I had slept through lunch, so I was starving, and we were on a long stretch of highway with no buildings to be seen. After two hours, we finally saw a sign for a nearby restaurant: @CAPS2�s peanut shade. I nearly cried. The last thing that affected the cyclist was the fish camp. It saved his life. He arrived and ""drank deeply from the sinle.� He was so happy that he wanted to kiss the owners of the camp. This also relates to the car trip I mentioned, because after hours of hunger, we found a very good sush : bar, and sush: is my favorite food."	3	3		3																					
1475	3	The story that I am doing the most was going to talk about what happen in the story I was not shore but the name of the story sound prety good if I was in the story I not be good becaus the story is really crazy I would be realy good two start and right	0	0		0																					
1476	3	In the setting they are in lodi, California. That is a part of the desert. The desert effects the cyclist real bad. For one it is really hot. Two the heat is making him thirsty and is running out of his water. Then last he is near no towns so he can�t get anymore water, so the setting does effect the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1477	3	The cyclist is most affected by e heat. He is exerting all his energy and will to get to Yosemite. The hot sun and lack of water makes him very tired and causes him to use his energy inefficiently. At one point, he has to make sure the building is a mirage. It is so hot his mind could be playing tricks on him.	1	1		1																					
1478	3	The conditions that the cyclist was in was very horid as he continued on his ride he got hotter and hotter hoping to find water after he finished of his last bit. Taking advices from an old man was and his last decision he made.	1	1		1																					
1479	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because sometimes, it made him lose some courage and optimism. �and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day� This is an example of how he lost courage. I wanted to be brave and be strong. But the hot day and all the sweat made the author feel weak. �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear� This is an example of how the author lost some optimism. He didn�t want to die, but he kept telling himself that he was going to , he should have thought to himself that he was going it make it, but the setting was just to rough. There were bumps along his ride, and the sun beating down his thirst, he became less courageous and less optimistic.	2	2		2																					
1480	3	The features of his journey are cruel. �Rolling hills,� make him work harder to get over them. The more he works, the more he sweats and therefore he needs fluids to do so. The lack of water he has does not help. Poisonous don�t really bother him if he leaves alone. The condition of the roads adds on to the hills. Rough roads make him work hard to get through and then over the hills. So this guy is getting it pretty rough.	2	1		2																					
1481	3	Some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hills. It says in  the reading � flat road was replaced by short rolling hills� this would wear a person out without a good supply of water and is not sure in what direction he is travelling. And another thin g that affects him is the hot june weather in California.	2	1		2																					
1482	3	Throughout �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affect the cyclist. The cyclist was traveling through a very dry area, where it was very hot, dry and dangerous. There was no water to be found and the terrain is were rough and bumpy. The speaker stated, �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously lareg snake...�  (Kurmaskie @NUM1).The cyclist fared land blockings and dangerous animals. This cause him to slow down a little bit. It was extremely not out in the setting he was in. The cyclist was in the deserts of California in June.The speaker stated, �@CAPS1 rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on gorgeous day in June...� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist was expirencing the high temperatures of the setting. The cyclist witnessed the intense  features of the setting.	2	2		2																					
1483	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in many ways. He becomes delusional when he said that  if he were lucky one of the stones would be lodged in his throat. Also he is dehydrated because he uses all of his water tend is having to push hard to make it to the next town.	2	2		2																					
1484	3	The features of the setting started out easy like a road thats flat cool lines to keep him cool and not hot. Then it sat harder lack of water road is not flat anymore snakes the cool pines are gone. 	1	1		1																					
1485	3	"In the story ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Limit,"" the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. As he was riding, he was passing through desert during June, a very hot month.There is not much water present in a desert (that would be part of the definition of a desert) and so, particularly in the even-hotter-than-normal June sun, he was at risk of running out of water. Had he been driving through, say, a forest or perhaps rolling grasslands, he might not have been in such danger, and could have merely looked for a river or dreck for water if he was desperate. Another thing that might have affected the cyclist would have been the affect of the desert on his mind. When people think of deserts they often think of dry, barren wastelands, complete with buzzards and maybe a dead cowskull, as in movies. Deserts are in intimidiating, they have a bad reputation and so, as he was riding through and was low on water thought of death how he was, ""going to die and the birds would pick (him) clean"" running through his now-teriffied head. Had he been in a city or in rolling farmland he might not have been as terrified. There are people in those places, and places to be safe there, but, in his desert, he had neither, allowing him to give way to despair. Setting does a lot to influence stories, so it is important to keep that in mind when reading. "	3	2		3																					
1486	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was out of water in a desert like environment and their was no one ground for most of it so he was down on his own. The cyclist was affected when in the story when he says ''I got down on my hands and knees, working the water handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tar like substaNce oozed out followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. That affected him because, he was drinking a lot of water before he got to that point in his trip and he was almost out so he needed to fill up with more but he did not have a place to get more water. That is one of the features of the setting that affected him.	1	1		1																					
1487	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by getting dehydrated, getting tired, and by getting lost. After the cyclist was on the road for a while he had drank almost all of his water, but he still had a while to go before he got to his destination. He was going to try to find some where to stop so he could pick up more water but there was nothing around. He also got tired because he was out in the sun, had barley any water, and he didn�t know where he was going. One last example was that he was lost. There were no cars, buildings, or people. So if he were to get hurt or sick no one would have been able to help him. In conclusion, being dehydrated, tired and getting lost were the features of the setting affect the cyclist had.	2	2		2																					
1488	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he runs out of water because he is trying to traverse the terrain. In the setting there is a desert in California that he is riding through on a bike, ""I was travelling through the high deserts of California� The word ""high"" means that there were hills which would make the journey even more difficult. The hills appeared later in the story as the cyclist said �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� When the speaker says replaced he is trying to show a change of terrain. another feature of the setting is the tumbleweed that he crosses other hills, �tumbleweeds crossed in path.� The tumbleweeds made him remember he was in the desert because tumbleweeds are associated with the desert which brought up the thought & dying and being picked apart by birds."	2	2		2																					
1489	3	Well if the setting relates to the theme then the story will make sence, like if it�s a sad story and it�s a ugly rainy day then it will match verry nice. That�s how the setting makes it better.	1	1		1																					
1490	3	If it is hot Out you can dehydrate quickley. also, if is ff ong hand hilly you use a lot of energy. It can berough on equipment, body, and mind. Make sure you dress apropreit lyand carry lot so f water. Next, make sure your tiresa inflated and all equip is working properly. then, plan a good route that you can stopat places and catch a breath or some water. also, make sure you eat well, food provides a lot of energy.	2	2		2																					
1491	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	2	3		3																					
1492	3	"In the story the cyclist was affected. The cyclist was affected by the directions of the old man. It sas that they gave it to him to help him out. That it was a shortcut. I think the cyclsit thinks the directions are out of date. The reason think this is that in the second sentence of the story it says, ""never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the continues of their porches since carter was in office."" The feature of the setting also affected him because he had to ride upand down through what he though of as it, rough terrain. That is what I think affected the cyclist."	2	2		2																					
1493	3	"In Joe Kurmaskie�s �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The terrain has a great deal to do with it. Also, the heat: First, the terrain affects the cyclist. It affects the cyclist because there is alot of hills. The text says, ""With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill.� In order to go down a hill, you had to have gone up a hill. So, having to use the energy to pedal up hills affected the cyclist alot. Next, the heat affected the cyclist. I know this because the text says �and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke.� This proves it is extremely hot outside. Heat would affect the cyclist because heat prevents you from functioning at your greatest ability. That is how the features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the cyclist. The terrain affects the cyclist because of the hills. The heat because it drains your energy quick. "	2	2		2																					
1494	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not exceed posted speed limit,� the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One way it affected him is the towns were old and deserted. In the story he said �This place might have been a thriving little spot� but @CAPS1 it was a ghost town.� He could not get any water or any directions. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because the roads were bumby and there were many hills. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 the cyclist had to use all his power to manuever over the hills. The third reason why the setting affected the cyclist was the weather and that it was a desert. �I was traveling through the deserts of California in June.� He was hot, sweaty and thirsty. He was also tired and desperate to find water and town that was not deserted. The features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by the roads, deserted towns and the lack of water.	2	2		2																					
1495	3	In the story �Rough road ahead do not exceed posted speed limits,� The setting is a long road with �no one in sight not a building, car or structure of any kind he cyclist could be affected by the rough road that he have to ride down.	1	1		1																					
1496	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his experience of bike riding in the desert. The setting affects the cyclist in many ways throughout the writing. At first, Kurmaskie is confident as he listens to a group of old codgers giving him advice. The setting is calm and happy and Kurmaskie writes that he �enjoyed the serenity of an eary-summer evening�. The word �serenity� gives the affect of calm and peace. However, as Kurmaskie proceeds into his journey, the setting changes. He is troubled by the �ramshackle shed, several rutsy pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule� in a ghost town that he meets in the desert. Even later, the terrain changes and he sees a sign stating �Rough Road Ahead�. Kurmaskie�s confidence turns into even deeper doubt and worry as his water supply runs low. Finally, kurmaskie sees a sign for a fish camp. Here, his hope returns as he finds a �rather modern bathroom� where he can stop to get a drink. As the setting changes, Kurmaskie�s confidence is followed by determination and then relief.	3	3		3																					
1497	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a dessert like place with a water surfage and he could hard tired. I would never have asked old people, he should have ask someone that was in charge of a store, because those people get asked many times. also he could have died if that snake got him or from what he said �heatroke.�	1	1		1																					
1498	3	The story begins as the author, a cyclist, has taken directions from several very old men to reach his bike-ridden destination of Yosemite National park. He starts out confident enough and then reaches the first town the gentleman described. It is a ghost town and amuses the author still believing he�s perfectly fine he sets out again this time arriving at a place with �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule� It is at this point that the author starts to worry as his water supply is low. He preceeds past rolling hills, snakes, tumbleweeds and different land-marks. Each one rips his confidence and exciterent to shreds. Especially the juice factory as the author is currently very dehydrated and losing all hope. Finally, he arrives at the water he seeks in the form of �Gary wilber�s fish camp,� and refreshes himself and his dried-out hope. Each time the author passed a land-mark his confidence took a beating, and even though he was in dire physical health not having any hope for his sunny breezy vacation can drain a person even more from the inside out.	3	3		3																					
1499	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist negitvly because he was in the desert in the summer with little water and no stones too get a drink at, For example he says �There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind's. This explains how his setting affected him because he had no where to go or get a drink. That is my reason why the cyclist settings where negitve.	1	1		1																					
1500	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in bad ways. The rocky road and steep hills made him peddle harder. The old people made him go through the rocky way. The temperature from the desert made him thirsty so he ran out of water fast, He said �When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� The heat could have killed him anytime. For example �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from the heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June.� This ride this man took to Yosemite was a very dangerous ride.  	2	2		2																					
1501	3	"The settnig can greatly effect the cyclist. The palce can change what happens and how it happens. For example if the story had taken place in alaska the cyclist would not have had, ""Wide rings of sweat circling my shirt."" and instead have been fighting off hypo thermia. The setting is very important because it affects all of the details in the writing. "	2	2		2																					
1502	3	At first the terrain was fine and he confident. But when he reached the first town it looked like one of those ghoust towns in the movies. The next town didnt come up when he was told it would. The terrain was that of a desert no water for miles. But he stayed determind. And he made it to some water though.	1	1		1																					
1503	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� For example, he finds a �ramshackle shed� and tries to find water. It affected him, because it says, �I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� The quote meaning that he was determined to find water and perhaps anything.	1	1		1																					
1504	3	The setting affected the cyclist by depriving him of hydration and weakening him. The large hills and rough roads ebbed away every bit of his strength and wore him down. The narration states, �Over one long, crippling hill� (kurmaskie @NUM1). This work choice reflects the writer�s feeling about his adventure. Words like �long� and �crippling� show that the trip was a horrible experience.	1	1		1																					
1505	3	Pride, determination, relief � all are things that the cyclist felt during his long bike ride. First the cyclist started of rideing on fresh legs and good directions, but after a while down the road he started to dought the old men, �a diary with my last entry in place of old men, their wisdom, and their been a sense of direction, I made a mental move to change it.� After feeling that the direction might be rough, he rode out of pride to get to his destination. Next the rider had great determination to get to his destination and did many things, �I gathered � a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth to take my mind off of thirst.� This quote shows that he would do almost anything to keep going. Finally the cyclist was fatigue when he arrived at the @CAPS1 shop because he then knew the old men were right and would reach his destination, �As I stumbled into rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink this quote shows he was polite naturally to get water but to know the men were right.	2	3		3																					
1506	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist when he was thirsty. �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could be seen.� This proves that the rider was thirsty because in the paragraph before this talks about him having a last burst of energy going down a hill. And he was also sweating a lot. And also wiping sweat from his eyes. 	1	1		1																					
1507	3	I work better when I can feel the  environment.  I think  the some goes  for  cycling  in  the  mountain , fresh air and no worries  on  you  mind them  cycling can become fun like the climates into the easy he even the fresh air,  the fine trees and the environment  makes him feel  better  so for cyclist environment plays a vital role.	1	1		1																					
1508	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a major way. The setting affected the cyclist performance. For example, the harsh temperature started to make his pedaling sluggish. The settings also made the cyclist a little frightened for instance, the cyclist came across a snake that he was terrified of. Again the settings affected the cyclist by tempting him. For example, the river tempted the cyclist to stop riding and go get a drink of water. In conclusion, the setting had a major affect on the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1509	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, a lot of the settings discoured the cyclist. �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. As soon as the cyclist hits this �town� he realizes that the old mens advice might not have been so great. The dry desert affects the cyclist the most. This hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirst, hot, and and sweaty. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke...� The cyclist's tune here is sarcastic but he is still concerned about his health because of the heat and lack of water. The fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him. Since he�s talked to the old men for directions he hasn�t seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything. So this definetly discourages the cyclist and makes him lose his will to continue his journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. 	3	3		3																					
1510	3	The cyclist traked through a barren land trying to get to a land of rivers and valleys. Trakling through the first town the cyclist saw a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps and corral lotated in the desert of California. The cyclist was very angry that the old men led him into this barren town, however he kept hope and traveled to the next town. Their, he found a abandond fruit juice factory and bottling plant, how the discuraged the cyclist started to give up. �I was going to die,� he clamed with all hope loot. The man feels like their is nothing left and it�s the old men who caused this. Then finally, he cme across a bait shop which he found an his own giving him a huge reliefe. The features effects his attitude because in a baren land you lose hope as did the cyclist. Therefore, what�s around us affect us as in education, friendship, and survival.	2	2		2																					
1511	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,'' the cyclist is affected doth emotionally and physically by the features of the setting. At the start, when he came to a deserted shed with rusty pumps, he began to feel discouraged. �[The] sight was troubling,�(page @NUM1) @CAPS1 on in the essay, the terrain changes from flat land to short, rolling hills and tumbleweeds began to pass. The cyclist is definitely affected by the change in terrain. He is now exhaugnted but continues to pump his legs and ride on. Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting how includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost detected by this. �I hung my head'' (page @NUM2) he confessed. In the end, once he finds an old fishermans store, he is relieved seeing the store from a distance excited the author, because, he could finally have a drink. The author mood and body were greatly affected by that features of the setting.	3	2		3																					
1512	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie show that as the day goes on the cyclist becomes tired and wornout from his long ride through rough terrain trying to find his way back home then he saw some buildings down a hill and said �With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill� (kurmakie @NUM1). After the rider gets home he says he is going to do it again.	2	2		2																					
1513	3	The main affect is the lack of water. It is in June, while riding his bike in California. Therefore it�s going to be very hot and he�ll need a lot of water t stay hydrated. When he sees that Welch�s Grape Juice factory, it just makes him think of his thirst even more. Also the terrain he is riding is not the easiest. He starts out riding on flat ground but then is riding on hills and not so flat terrain. This doesn�t help his dehydration. That�s why you should always carry a lot of water with you if you�re riding a bike during the summer	2	2		2																					
1514	3	The affects of the settings was how hot it was and the cyclist road he was on. The rider said it was June in the summer time, very hot. And the roads were not smooth, the were very old and ragady.	1	1		1																					
1515	3	In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� a cyclist is going against heat lack of water and rough hills trying to maneuver around.	1	1		1																					
1516	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is tRying to bike up hills and down hills, which can be very tiRing. Also, the hot aiR can dehydRate him, which can cause him to pass out. Along with the dRy aiR, theRe is dRy land, which means theRe is no place to stop foR wateR oR take a @CAPS1. The Rough @CAPS2 make the biking naRaeR because it involves moRe eneRgy than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the  middle of the Road made it haved foR the bikeR to go aRound. If the snake would have bitten him he could have died fRom poison.	2	2		2																					
1517	3	"The setting in the essay ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very hot in dry, very little shade or moisture, at some point maybe even none at all. This whether affected the author because he had no water at all so he was getting more dehydrated the further he went."	1	1		1																					
1518	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist. The feature was that you should never take advice from old people that never get out of the house. For example in the story it says, �Never accept travel advice from collection of old. times who haven�t left confines of their porches since carter was in office.� This affecting the setting because if it weren�t for his map and let them take a peek at it, That would of saved him a load of trouble.	1	1		1																					
1519	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting of the terrain was hot and water draining. In the text it says �Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees� this proves that the cyclist is exagerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says �I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.� This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out. In conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best. 	2	2		2																					
1520	3	"In the story, there are many features of the setting that affect the cyclist. One setting feature is the rolling of steep hills. The hills make the cyclist exhausted and even more desperate for water. For example, in the story it says, �Over one long crippling hill, a building came into view�. This shows that the hill was very hard and strenuous to get over. By using the word crippling it informs us that the hill was brutal and very hard to get over. Another setting I feature that affects the cyclist is the absence of any civilization on his cycling path. While he was riding he notices that there is nobody around to help him if he gets in trouble or needs water. The absence of people makes him feel stressed and worried about his journey. It shows this in the story when he say, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. Also it says in the story �I was going to die and the bird would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear and a diary with the last entry on the parse of old men"". This shows that there was nobody around to help him and he knew it. He thought he would die alone and that birds would eat him. He was obnonely worried about the absence of people."	3	3		3																					
1521	3	Usally the features, setting has an major affect upon the cyclist. The features, setting relates, and describes the hassh, and eventually relief condition of the cyclist. The setting relates to the person and plays a role, which the cyclist can observe. One reason how the features of the setting affects the cyclist is it shows the various problems that are being faced with the cyclist. For example, the cool pines, no one in sight, and I am alone. The way how this interepts a clear meaning, I the cyclist needs help getting home, and eventually by traveling, he needs water, to fill his thirst. Prior to thisy, the features, shows the weakness of the cyclist. For example, with that i believed it was my last burst of energy, as I consently, maneuvered down the hill. The features, and settings, affect the cyclist by showing how he was facing his troubles, thirst and fear, which all lead behind him at the end. These features and settings develop a clear understandmet, for the cyclist, and what is to be expected, in by him.	3	2		3																					
1522	3	"The features of the setting had a big impact on the cyclist. When he started that ride, he was confident that the �old timers� were right about which directions and roads he had to take to get to Yosemite National Park. Though the sun was bearing down, he refused to give up, just as he says� The sun was beginning to beat down, but I hardy noticed.� He came up to places that were worn down and deserted, so he knew he was alone if anything happened. The desert heat had made him down his water pretty regularly, so he tried to get more, as in, ""I got on my hands and knees When l tried a drop or two, it has the flavor of battery acid"" paragraph @NUM1. He was so thirsty that he would drink hot water. Then he thought he has only @NUM2 miles to go, so he kept going. He weakening as he pedaled along the changing terrain as he was �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. �With what little energy he had last, he had passed an abandoned Well be Grape Juice factory, which probably tested his patience and sanity. He had resorted to, �gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth� just to keep his mind his thirst. He was losing hope when he came upon � Gary and wilber�s fish camp best bet� then he felt relieved after he was able to get cool water. By then he's learned his lesson, to stick to his map."	3	3		3																					
1523	3	"In the author's recollection of his long and tiresome bike ride he talked about the struggles he had to face. when he set out that morning he asked some old guys on a porch for directions to @CAPS1. They told him that they knew the way and that they knew a shortcut. He choose to take their advice but later regreted it. when he found the towns that they spoke of all he found was ghost towns. ""Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since carter was in office. ""He dose eventually reach a town were he finds signs of life. There he asks another old guy if he knows the way to Yosemite, the guy says he has a good map. All along his ride he was pleged by the sun and lack of watrer. The sun made him hot and thirsty which forced him to drink a lot of his water. when he rached his last few sips he resisted from drinking it and began loosing consciesness. ""I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June."""	3	2		3																					
1524	3	A cyclist can only travel as fast as slow as he pedals. If the setting is a humid sunny day he can�t go to fast due to his lung capacity. If it is a warm but windy day he has to wath his speed to keep from getting hurt. Basically unless the weather is nice or safe enough he will go fast. But his safty care first so it depend on the weather mostly but also the time of the day. If it is night [dark] the reflectors must be put on to keep from getting it.	1	1		1																					
1525	3	The features in the setting affecting the cyclist because of the heat and the terrain. I say this because in the story it describes all the hills that he has to go up and down with the herendous heat beating down on him. The heat also makes it hard because it makes you drink more and throughout the story he was trying to find some water, and the water he did find was about �two hundred degrees and tasted like a battery acid.� If you have no water that makes it very hard to bicycle that far of a distance in that much heat.	1	1		1																					
1526	3	The cyclist is affected by many features in the setting. the long hill is one example the snake and the dirt road are two more. The heat of the desert is another and his depleting water supply are all examples of features that affected him.	1	1		1																					
1527	3	"There were many features of the setting that affeced the cyclist. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM2 there is a sign that states rough road a head. One page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM4 it says ""over the long onpiling hill.� He also the tempature as started on page @NUM5 and at the top of page @NUM1 paragraph @NUM7 � l was travling in hing desertd of california in June. These conditions of the setting all effect the cyclist."	1	1		1																					
1528	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story. First of all, in the story it says ��and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke�� (@NUM1). This quote shows that it is extremely hot and it is affecting his riding. The narrarator also says, �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state�(@CAPS1 @NUM2). This quote is saying that he is dehydrated in is having trouble keeping balance on the rough terrain. In conclusion, the setting affected the cyclist in this story.	2	1		2																					
1529	3	The setting affects the cyclist by wanting to go longer and riding the bike. And to see what is up ahead. By riding a bike in the heat, you can have a heat stroke and die from dehydration and the heat. That�s why you are supposed to have a lot of water with you when you are riding a bike.	1	1		1																					
1530	3	THE CYCLIST SETTINGS HINDER HIM IN THE ESSAY �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD. THE CYCLIST IS IN THE DESERT IN THE SUMMER TIME WITH HARDLY ANY WATER. HE IS TRYING TO FIND HIS WAY TO YOSEMITE, BUT HE GETS LOST ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE SOME OLD MEN GAVE HIM BAD DIRECTIONS. DURING THIS TIME HE IS RIDING HIS BICYCLE FOR MILES AND MILES IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER. HIS THOUGHTS OF THIRST GET IN THE WAY OF HIM TRYING TO CONTINUE ON TO FIND YOSEMITE. I BELIEVE THAT IF THE CYCLIST WAS IN A COOLER ENVIRONMENT THEN THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BECAUSE HIS SETTINGS WERE SORT OF A DISTRATION TO HIM	1	2		2																					
1531	3	The cyclist became very tired and the area he was in did not help at all. he was in the desert in june very hot day and every town he had come to was abandoned and had no water. It was also very hilly which made the work even harder. 	3	2		3																					
1532	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road Ahead, Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" affect the cyclist because the determine how easy or hard he ride is for the cyclist. For example. The land being hot, would enable him to die or heat struck without water, the land being dry means he doesn�t have a place to refill his water supply and the land being barren means to the man that if he didn�t be of heat stroke there is a chance he wouldn�t be found and wouldn�t survive. Another example of how the features of the setting offer the cyclist is in the story when the road gets rough and he sees the speed time sign his though are about here he is going a water depleating 12 mph. This shows that he features of the setting, namely the contour of the land and the roughness or he road make the journey a lot harder on the cyclist. The features of a setting could possibley be the biggest arrest on a cyclist, and whether they have a long hard journey in which they have to push themselves to the limit like in this story or a nice lersury ride."	3	2		3																					
1533	3	The cyclist �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was definatly affected by the setting. He was cycling in California - which is a hot place to begin with - in June - which made it even hotter coming upon a hot desert. When you�re doing a physical activity like that, the last thing you want is to be in the heat. The narrator only brought one bottle of water which at first he was drinking regularly. Then it started to get hot and he was out of water. This affected his body by making him tired, and his mind because he started doubting himself. Then there was the abandon juice building where they made juice. He said �In an ironic twist abandon years earlier had been a Welch�s grape juice factory and bottling plant.� He was dying of thirst and then he found the bottling plant. The cyclist was definatly affected by his surrondings both mental - by saying �I�m going to die.� - and physically by becoming dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
1534	3	The cyclist was riding in some rough, dry and abandoned terrain that made his journey almost fatal. He described it as, �In the high deserts of California in June.� It was dry, lifeless and hot The sun was beating on him and he needed to frequently drink water, but he was running out. The empty towns were what he was wanting on for fresh water, but they�d been very abandoned. This made his journey very dangerous. He could�ve fallen off at any time because of heat stroke He would�ve died right then and there. His sweat was drying in the heat and there was no way for him to cool off in the lifeless desert: lifeless and dry. He had to enhance these extreme. Ironical conditions for miles on end, just to find some water. It was all that a desert is and all that a home shouldn�t go through.	2	3		3																					
1535	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist in manyway. The hills are to long. Every town is fear appert and the rodes are rought. The heat also affectes him. He is affected health wise.	1	1		1																					
1536	3	When your doing any sport or any thing were you sweat your setting is everything. If your sweating in a setting you can easily get sick. The setting from the story Rough road ahead the cyclist had no water and the setting was very hot. Thats why the cyclist was tired and sick because he was sweating and had no water. Thats how the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1537	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist  greatly. The features is old abandon towns and hot temperatures. Also abandoned buildings. This makes the cyclist think All hope is lost. The essay says this �Over one long crippling hill, a bulding came into view [...] I hung my head that smoky blues tune ""summertime rattle around."" Then to a happy mo In an ironic twist that should please all sadist reading this, the building [...] by the looks  afit had been a welch�s  grape Juice factory and bottling plant [...] I hung my head that smoky bluees tune sumertime rattle around.� Then to a happy mood it states �As I stumbled into a ra ther modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, i had a overwhelming  urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.""  "	2	2		2																					
1538	3	With no one around and rough road ahead not to mention dehydration the cyclist begin to feel he was going to die. Because of this he began to dout himself but each time he saw something he tried to get there.	1	1		1																					
1539	3	The features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist. For one, he was biking through the high deserts of California in June. This caused the cyclist to become overheated ad sweaty. So he drank from his water bottles frequently. Unfortunately, since there was, �no one insight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind,� he had nowhere to fill his bottles and become dehydrated. To make matters worse, the terrain changed from flat road to �short, rolling hills�. Normally, this would not cause too much struggle, but since he was dehydrated and overheated, each hill seemed �crippling�, My thoughts are that if the setting had been a bit cooler and perhaps on the time period the old men had lived in, the cyclist would have had a much more enjoyable experience.	2	3		3																					
1540	3	Excitement, desperation, and self-pitty are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite park because of it peacefulness. He said, �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name.� He wanted to get their because it was so hot. He started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of this hot water hole. �I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid.� He was running out of water so he got desperate for some. He started to have self-pitty on his self,� sometimes life can be so cruel,� he was feeling pitty on himself because he had such a long way to go still. These are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting.	2	2		2																					
1541	3	"Features of the setting affect the cyclist�s moods in many ways. The story says. �About fourty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first ""town.� ""The cyclist is probably allready tired from pedaling for fourty miles. Then he finds out that the town is desserted, which makes him a little frustrated. The next few stops are also desserted and he is almost out of water. He is becoming desperate. The road becomes bumpy and there is a large snake blocking the way. He is terrified. Finally, he reaches a bait shop with cool water ,and he is relieved. As you can see, the cyclist goes though many moods caused by the setting of the story."	2	2		2																					
1542	3	The way the feature of the setting affected the cyclist is that  its in June in the middle of the desert. Also he was given wrong	1	2		2																					
1543	3	The cyclist was affected by the climate, the people, and the surrounding. The climate was the desert in June which was very hot with little water. This made him dehydrated and miserable. The old men that �helped� him acused think to be in the guiding situation he was in. There were no surrounding shop or buildings that were inhabined. This way there was no place for him to get any water nouroushment.       	2	2		2																					
1544	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by when the story says �Twenty miles up the road. I came to a fork of sorts�, This statement from the story affected the cyclist because he didn�t know which way to go. Another feature that affected the setting is when the story says �I got on my hand and knees, Working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength�. That statement shows that the cyclist was dieing for water and he didn�t think any was going to come out. Last feature that affected the cyclist was when the story says �Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. This shows that the rider had to go under a speed limit but he was earlier tired and he was going way under it and that he could make it up the rough road.	2	3		3																					
1545	3	The dry, deserted area the cyclist is in, has many caations and	2	2		2																					
1546	3	In the text, the author was cycling to Yosemite park through a desert which dehydrated him and changed his mood. Going through this desert he ran out of water so he stopped. Some of the  towns he was told of which turned out to be deserted, and as he could not find water there he soon because dehydrated. This is the obvious affect the setting had on him, another affect was to cause him to doubt old people and to change his mood from confident to desperate. As he was cycling through the desert, desperately chinging to life in hopes he could find, are water, he realized that old people know of the past better than the future as they don�t get out to the every changing world as much as they used to whereas, at the beginning he was confident in the directions and wisdom of the old men. The setting he was in made him a little more wise.	2	3		3																					
1547	3	Because the setting of the cyclist ride is dry desert it makes the cyclist seem more and more determined. He's is going against the odds so it seems like hes pushing himself to the limit. Against the heat and the long road he's on and having no water all seems lost for the cyclist. But in the end he pulls himself together and makes it happen for himself and triumphs over adversity.	1	1		1																					
1548	3	From reading the story, l believe the setting of the desert he was cycling affected him immensly. I believe it affected him in the way his attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. At first he was very motivated, determined, and hydrated. As time and miles went on the scenery mover changed.That can be really hard. in heated water or, you need to be as hydrated ad possible, especially it an enduring in physical activity. When time he went on, he was getting low on water and had nothing in think about a long other them, how much larger, how thirsty he was  and is this worth it? It is a lot eager to the motivated when there is thing to look at to keep your mind of the attitude of the cyclist changed for the worst. In my point of view strongly believe that it could have been form working at the some sandy desert for seeds a long period of time. I have ??? ??? ??? in exercising while making on  ???. It�s hard to see  ??????????? thing. My attitude will go farm.� I�m so determined to I�m bored � to� what�s the point.� But I thought it was great how he never gave up ??? things got bad. It opened my eyes to see how great it is to reacts your own goals.        	2	2		2																					
1549	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist by dehydrating him. The cyclist said, �I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake."" The cyclist was in the desert and each mile he rode he became more and more dehydrated.  The desert sun drying out his body. He said with each passing landmark, �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.�  @CAPS1 that the more he went on the more the desert affected him and dehydrated him."	1	1		1																					
1550	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. One way is that the cyclist not sticking to his map. Instead of sticking to his map he had asked a couple of old people. The old people that gave the cyclist directions also gave him a short cut to take. That�s where the second effect came in where the cyclist started to use a shortcut instead of the main road. That�s how the features of the setting affected the cyclist.   	1	1		1																					
1551	3	Some features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the road conditions and road changes with the hills. So far the cyclist had a great ride for about two miles into his journey after that it started to change. This is supported when the author states, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing� (kurmaskie). Even though the author started this journey out nice it did not take long for thing to change against him. Although the hills and road conditions changing the character in the story still gets through his problems with out much worries. With all of the problems in the setting the cyclist still comes through to end his journey.	1	2		2																					
1552	3	The features of the setting cause the cyclist two main problems: doubt and dehydration. From the essay, you can infer that the cyclist doubts he will ever make it to Yosemite because of the constant features in the essay that cause him to lose his hope and confidence. For example, near the end of the essay the cyclist is already exhausted and hopeless but then sees a building over a hill. He hurries to the building only to find out that it is an abandoned, run�down @ORGANIZATION1 factory. After getting his hopes up, he is forced to get back on his bike and carry on. This features of the setting causes further disappointment to the cyclist and installs more doubt into his mind. Despite losing his confidence and hopes to make it to Yosemite, the features of the setting also cause him a serious, literal problem: dehydration. The weather is not and he has to carry on over hills and on rough roads. He is running low on water and at the one town he finds the water from the pump is undrinkable. The features of the setting are causing him these problems and are the reason hid health is at risk.  	3	3		3																					
1553	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. @NUM1 way is the condition of roads. Another is the heat. Another is snakes. Another is no town insight. The final one is lack of info. @MONTH1 be the guy made it. @MONTH1 be he got hurt on the ride.  Maybe a snake bit him. Either way, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways.   	1	1		1																					
1554	3	In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and desserted. The description could suggest lonlieness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone and didn�t know where he was going, he still persisted. While he thought about �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� This thought kept him strong, so he kept trying.	1	1		1																					
1555	3	There were many land features that affected the cyclist and his trip. First of all, it is a desert, which greatly affects him as there is no water in deserts. There was also a snake, which could have bit and kiiled him. As the road were not very well paved and had obviously been abandoned for years it made cycling much harder for him. And the juice factory just taunted him, making him remember his need for water, as did the well that did not pump cold water, but instead pumped hot,gross water	1	1		1																					
1556	3	When the cyclist first starts his journey he is very sure of himself. He sees everything as the old men told him. As he travels on he notices everything is abandoned and empty. �There was no one in sight not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� The man started becoming very unsure. You could tell he says �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get excited.� He was very doubtful he�d get to where he was going. In the end he was very relieved he found a fishing spot with a bathroom and fresh water.  	2	2		2																					
1557	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist in this story alot. Having unreliable directions, barely enough water for the journey, poor road conditions and other hazards like the heat and animals made this a very difficult journey for the cyclist. Starting the journey the cyclist recieved bad information on how to get to his destonation which lead him on a long hard journey with not much water. He says in the story �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM2�. This means he was running out of water too fast for the amount of land he was covering. Another feature of the netting that affected him was that the road conditions got worse and worse untill he reached a high way late in his journey. He said �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills."" This means the faster, easy, to ride terrain was replaced by slower harder to ride on terrain. These features of the setting could have been very dangerous and maybe factal and affected the cyclist alot living this story. "	3	2		3																					
1558	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist, because as his surrondings changed he lost hope of making it to Yosemite National park. Such as when he was riding through his first town and it looked abandoned he wasn�t so sure if he shold keep going. As well as when he didn�t see anyone or any buildings he got worried and was wanting to lose hope. But  as second road sign appeared he was relieved.	2	1		2																					
1559	3	The setting in this short story cause the cyclist to doubt his survival. The main problem is water, or lack there of. The cyclist has no water and thinks it�s only a matter of time before he dies. Another big problem is the rough terrain. The rough terrain is hard for the cyclist to overcome. Also, there is no buildings, people, or cars in sight to save him. Until he finds the bait shop, if anything would have happened to him, there would�ve been no one there to help.	2	2		2																					
1560	3	The features of the setting of �Do not exceed posted speed limit� greatly impact the cyclist, in a negative way. For example, when the road changes from smooth and easy to rolling and full of hills. It makes it difficult for him to bike. He needs to use more energy to get over the hills. Another example is when it says �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� The connection with seeing a tumbleweed is that of being deserted and alone so this increased his feelings of despair. Lastly, he sees the Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, which is deserted and serves to only make him thirstier. All of these things affect the cyclist. The fact that he sees the grape juice factory is also ironic, because he is extremely dehydrated and the factory is abandoned.	3	2		3																					
1561	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a few ways. first of these is the blazing heat. He is basically in a desert and he is running low on water. As he starts to run out of water he starts conserving it which is dehydrating him so he is becoming weaker, �I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so- a test of my inner spirit. Next up is the rough terrain. When you hit rough terrain on a bike it can get hard to keep going and the cyclist was already short on water �a large highway sign jumped out at me. I read: rough road ahad: Do not exceed posted speed limit sometimes life can be so cruel�. Finally is the structure First there was the Ghost town with the �battery acid� tasting water. Also there was the Welch�s grape Juice factory and bottling plant which were both probably dimeriling. �A sandblusted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head�. As you can see the features of the settings generily affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
1562	3	The author finds the desolate and harsh settings to be not discouraging, rather they stand out as a cause of amusement and fun, quest-like tests. The author writes that after arriving at his first ghost-town, he chuckles, amused by the funny �old codgers� and their crazy ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isn�t the least bit established anymore, he�s slightly disappointed, but sees it as �a test of [his] inner spirit.� At the third building an abandoned factory he still appreciates the irony of the situation. While biking across the desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and instead uses it as a point of reference to work his progress and as a way to push himself. Though the author is faced with empty disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing 	1	1		1																					
1563	3	"In the story Rough Road Ahead: do not excess speed limit, the reader sees the scenery and terrain get rougher, and lonelier, and as the cyclist travels and limits are being pushed his outlook is somewahat grim he only expects the worst. The rough road strats out after a water pump he finds gives him piping not, brackish water that tasted like battery acid. Water in a sense in this story is a metaphor to his life, and is the source for him living. In the beginning he drank it regularly and when he gets to the pump it is bad, just like when things start to turn sour in the story itself. The cyclist in this story is very a ware to how his body is and acknowledges his dehydration. At one point he says �and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke simply because I had listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porches in a decade"" he later said it caused him to laugh sadly, hopelessly the lack of humans and their technology really broke him down."	3	3		3																					
1564	3	The desert is the crulest of nature�s environments. Its lack of water, dry air, and punishing heat are enough to kill even the hardiest creature. When traveling through a desert, one must maintain a constant water supply and know their path with respect to the power of nature in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, cycler Joe Kurmaskie must overcome the desert�s heat and lack of water to survive. As the author observes in paragraph @NUM1, �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, I could drop from heatstroke.� If the human body overheats, it becomes sick and unable to properly function. When in the desert one must keep cool or perish. In @NUM2, Kurmaskie begins to realize the danger of running out of water in the desert, � I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June. �As this water starts to run out, Joe suffers from dehydration, despair, and a loss of balance. Water is essential in a desert environment, without it, as Joe observes, �the birds would pick (you) clean, leaving only some expensive out door gear�.	3	2		3																					
1565	3	"The features in the setting of the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do not exeed the Posted Speed limit� affect the cyclist in a cruel manner. The old man say that the towns are going to be there and they are just not functioning towns. To make the cyclist feel hopeless the setting puts him in a California day in June which is extremely hot and puts in all these unexpected twists. A cruel thing to add in the essay was when it read �The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mph� This lowers the cyclists confidence making him seem more worried. Another cruel thing is the author adding a welch�s Grape Juice factory that had been abandoned with �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring @NUM1 refreshing glass of juice into his mouth"" totally causing him to lose hope left. These features in setting are cruel."	3	3		3																					
1566	3	The features in the setting, such as the ghost town desert, and the Juice factory, give the cyclist a sense of hopelessness. He is running out of water when he comes to the ghost town, which he thought was @CAPS1 because the next town was only a short ways down the road. However when he came to the next �town� and attempted to use the water pump, a rather hot, foul liquid came up instead of water. He was beginning to lose hope when he came to the Welch�s factory, abandoned. All hope from him at that point was lost, claiming �the birds will pick me clean,� To the cyclist also was best, then he was �saved� by a bait shop. These features in the setting gradually emptied his hope little by little, until he came to the Bait shop after which his hope, but certainly not his fait in old men, was returned.	2	3		3																					
1567	3	"In the setting of the essay; ""Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit."" had a great affect on the cyclist. It made him even more determined to finish because the terrain was so hard to ride through. For example, ""At some point, tumber weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake-it really did look like a diamond back-back the majority of the pavement in front of me, I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. ""The author fully explains how no matter how bad the obstacles are he comes across he keeps trying to easy on by. The terrain affect the character by keeping him determined. This happens to many people in their sports. For example in football they take any problems and use them as reasons to push themselves harder to finish the game. "	1	1		1																					
1568	3	This essay takes place on a barren desert landscape.The setting being very hot causes him to get dehydrated faster. Also fones are scarce. In this place as he says sometime into free essay, �the negg down was only @NUM1 down the road. This place also caused him to question what he saw thinking it might be just a mirage.	1	1		1																					
1569	3	The many features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. The beauty of nature around him affected him by making him laugh. In the essay, it says, � on a gorgeous day in June caused him to laugh.� This shows, despite what happened, he was might are on a nice day outside giving him an optimistic attitude. Also, the beating sun affected him in a different way. It caused him to sweat and almost die of dehydration. � growing realization that l could drop from heatstroke � This shows that he was tensely aware that he could die from the suns might. So, the settings around the cyclist affected him in different ways.	2	1		2																					
1570	3	In the setting the conditions were brutal. The author experienced sedring heat, dyhdration and getting wrong directions. He experienced depression and mear death. He had an encounter with a big old snake and last he reached his distination. This affected him and he learned to bring a map and not to take direction from old people.	1	1		1																					
1571	3	The setting affected the cycist because it made his ride harder. For example, the weather was extremly hot. �The sun was beginning to beat down.� He says it didn�t affect him, yet he was very thirsty and dehydrated so internally it affected him. Also, the weeds and snakes frightened him. �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� This could not of made his ride easier. Next the hills and roads, �over one long, crippling hill.� This proves how intense his ride was. Thats how the setting affected the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie.	1	2		2																					
1572	3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says� i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can�t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find �towns� nearby. Once he finds them, they are either �ghost towns� or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way.	3	2		3																					
1573	3	The settings effects the cyclist because in California it could be really hot sometimes. The cyclist could dehydrate on a long trip and pass out really get hurt. Also there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1574	3	In the essay, the author added many features that could be picked all about the cyclist jouney. One feature was that his water supply was running short. This shows exactly how hot it was and how much he was drinking. Another feature would be the rusty old pipe with the bad water: This shows that that town had been abanodoned for years and the water supply wasn�t up for drinking. The essay in all shows how hand it is in hot weather with lack of supplies and no sense of direction.	2	2		2																					
1575	3	The cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� had to go through a hard time in the California desert.  It was hard for him because it was very hot in the desert in June. That he was almost out of water; at first his ride was easy on flat ground. But when he came to rolling he had to use more energy and ???.	1	1		1																					
1576	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was really thirsty and then the dry air with no town nearby made it even worse. There was also the bumpy roads and hills that were tiring and mad the cyclist even thirstier. Finnally there was the factory that made him think about juice and made him thirstier yet.	2	1		2																					
1577	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by old people changing the definition of adon�t talk to strangers. The main character	1	1		1																					
1578	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because real cyclist know what the speed is for a bike so you don�t need to tell them. If a cyclist needed some dierections they would go to a gas station not to some old person�s house. A real cyclist can go as long as they want before the stop because they are tired. A real cyclist knows haw to do tricks on a bike don�t have to do them over and over again to be able to do them. A real cyclist doesn�t have to train to go into a tourtement and win they must have to practice to be able to win.	2	1		2																					
1579	3	"The setting in the story had a big effect on the cyclist. The hot deserted surroundings made the cyclist become tired or discoveraged. For example the cyclist observes, ""one ramshacure shed, several rusty pumps, and a comes that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was trouble."" This quote shows the old, beat down environment worried him. Also the author says, ""there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" In this quote, the cyclist realizes his isolation, and begins to become more determined to reach his destination. Realize, ever been lost, then youknow that it can be discouraging if there's no sign of life around you. All you want to do is keep going and hope you can find your way. This feeling is shown through the cyclistand now the setting around him affects his journey."	2	3		3																					
1580	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One of them is that it was in the daylight and the sun bothers the cyclist. Another one is that because there was nothing around him, he felt frustrated. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� If something were there, he wouldn�t feel frustrated and at least he would have more hope to find something. 	1	2		2																					
1581	3	"In the narrative ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected in a deadly negative way by the setting. The cyclist is travelling through �The high deserts of California in June.� It was hot, so hot the infact, that the author realized he could �drop from heatstroke� at anytime. This unbearable heat, coupled with the �crippling� hilly terrain was enough to reduce the cyclist to a stale of severe dehydration. Obviously not exactig a positive effect. The swelting heat and merciless hills of the setting would not be quite so awful if there had been locations to stop, rest and replenish the eyeishes diverting water supply. However, �There was no one in sight, not a building, or a structure of any kind� The cyclist was incomplete isolation for over @NUM1 miles of arid desert, the sweating sun heating down upon him as he toiled up steep unyielding hills clearly the setting was affecting the cyclist in horribly negative way."	3	3		3																					
1582	3	When riding a bike for a very long time with no water is bad but is even worst when your surroundings are worst. For example, when the cyclist has no water it is a day with nothing around him to help. Also with no water he could pass out & get dehydrated. When he finds no one to help & nothing around him he sucks on a pebble to keep his mouth hydrated. Therefor you should always check you destination on a bike before just going for it.	2	2		2																					
1583	3	It is very difficult to be outside in heat, let alone advise from old folks and riding a bike. If it feels like it is @NUM1 out sides, you don�t need to be out there. Doesn,t matter how long you are outside for, a heatstroke could come at any body fast than they can count to @NUM2.	1	1		1																					
1584	3	On the way to @CAPS1 the cyclist was riding through dry, hot weather in rough terrain. This was making him tired and dehydrated. Half way throgh his journey he couldn't see anything for miles. That must of been discouraging. All the way there he was dehydrated and when he found water it was @NUM1 degrees @CAPS2 because of the heat.	1	1		1																					
1585	3	Hot, bumpy roads, no shade-all are things that affect the cyclist on his journey. He was riding in??? the and then the sun started beating down on him and he said it felt like the desert,� considering it was so hot. The road was fine at first and than he get a while down the had and it really started getting rough and hard to ride on. The part where he has no shade has to suck because he has the sun beating down on him all the time. All are reasons why the cyclist shouldn�t have taken directions in the first place.	2	2		2																					
1586	3	The setting of �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed the Speed Limit� effects the cyclist in many was. The words �high deserts of California in June,� from the story show that it is very hot and dry. The cyclist get's very tired and in the desert there aren't big ponds to get water out of, so if you don�t have water you don�t have anything. Also the cyclist suffers the pain a difficulty of having to drive on, over and down rough terrain. In the story it is said there was a sign that said �Rough Road Ahead.� There were also obsticals such as tumbleweeds and snakes he had to get around. The dry, rough, dangerous setting put the cyclist life in danger, but because of dedication he got through it.	2	2		2																					
1587	3	"The features of the setting in �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� affected the cyclist. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The flat road that was easy to bike on had changed to many hills that made the cyclist's job alot harder. The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope."	2	2		2																					
1588	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected is when they have to cross the hills and plains. The hills make it very hard to pedal when going up hill. Another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water. They need water to survive especially during their long bike ride. Lastly, the heat the cyclist must endure also affects them. The heat makes it hard to stay focused on making the long journey.	2	2		2																					
1589	3	The features effect the setting of the story in a big way. At the beginning of his ride there are people around and he has no troubles. After he talks to the old men and starts on his ride to the @NUM1 town there is no one around. There are no buildings in site at all and no source of water. Since there was no one around his confidence of actualy completing the trip begar to go down. Once he arrived at the first town he noticed that it was an old town and no one was there anymore. This made him mad and his confidence dropped a lot. Once he reached the next building he noticed that there was no one there either and then thought hed never make it and that he die. Once he reached the final place it was a more occupied setting. There were people around. He then began to feel relieved that he could get water. The setting with no one around make him lose a lot of confidence.	3	2		3																					
1590	3	The features of a setting, such as terrain and weather greatly affect the cyclist who is biking in it. The features of a setting can make the cyclists trip either easier or harder. Weather can make them use up their water faster or slower, rain as bad road conditions could force a cyclist go slower. In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist is slowed down and more fatigued because of the features of the setting he was in. The lack of water and settlements slowed him down. Rough roads did as well. Hills and animals on the road slowed down the cyclist even more.  The features of a setting can help or hinder a cyclist, and in the case of the one in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features seriously impared his bike ride.	2	2		2																					
1591	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. It it was a straight road, it would be smooth sailing. If the road was bumpy, he�d jump up and down a little. If he was riding in the woods, it would be cool and a little dark. If he was riding in the desert, it would be very hot and bright.	1	1		1																					
1592	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� greatly affect the cyclist. I�m sure that the heat makes the cyclist more thirsty, and heat can also drain energy extremely fast. Being in �the california desert in the middle of June� does not sound like an enjoyable time to be riding a bike. When the cyclist got tired and exhausted from not having any water, I�m sure that riding past all of the empty land had an effect on his attitude. I think that seeing a building made him get excited, and then when he found out that it was nothing more than an abandoned building, his spirits greatly dropped. He probably felt that he couldn�t continue for very much longer simply because all of the buildings he came across were empty, or abandoned. When the cyclist reached the bait store, he probably felt much better, and very relieved to have gotten there before he had a heat stroke.	3	2		3																					
1593	3	"When the cyclist passed through the old towns the old man told him to, the setting played a big part in making his situation harder to overcome when he passed through the first abandoned town, the water source was dry and empty. The text says ""pumped the handle for several minutes but the water would not cool it tasted like battery acid.� The second drink source he passed was on abandoned @PERSON1�s Juice factory. The text says,�a sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth.� These two objects made his situation mentally harder to get through because he was so close to what he needed numerous times, then it was taken away."	2	3		3																					
1594	3	The cyclist is affected by the change in terrain from flat to hilly, the elderly men�s directions and most importantly his thirst. He tries to save what little water he has left for time when he really needs it. He looks for a place to cool off and get water, which he finally does in the end. He�s also a little bit angry and disappointed of the old men�s directions. He�s really going a lot more miles then he should be according to the directionsand he's beginning to wonder if they�ve lost it. 	2	2		2																					
1595	3	There are many different features such as the weather, road condition, and how the person is feeling. The weather can effect if it is rain or weather the road are messed up he could get a flat. The way that the person is feeling is a big part on weather they try hard or they do not worry about it too much.	3	2		3																					
1596	3	According to the essay features of the setting affect the cyclist. If the cyclist is in the middle of a hot desert in June with no water, the cyclist will become excessively thirsty the longer they go. For example; the author states �I had been hitting my bottles pritty regularly, and I was traveling through the high desert of California in June�. The terrain changes to short, rolling hills from flat land causing the cyclist to push herself to get the next town to get water. For instance; she states �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view�. This cause the cyclist to use what they thought of as their last burst of energy to get down there, but the building was abandoned, thus making the cyclist feel let down. As the cyclist continued on a setting of a bait store came and the cyclist felt relief because now she could get water. These examples show the change of setting on the cyclist�s trip and how it affected her.	3	3		3																					
1597	3	"In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. He followed the �short cut� that some old men gave him, instead of taking the longer route. These old men had no clue what they were realy talking about, so the cyclist ended up taking a path through more obstacles. When the cyclist was in need of more water he ran into ""several rusty pumps."" No water would come out of these pumps so he had no choice but to keep going @CAPS1 water. As he moved forwad in his travels he said that the �Flat roads were replaced by short, rolling hills.� @CAPS1 any water, he did not have much strength left to face rolling hills, but he had no choice. The cyclist had to go on for miles @CAPS1 seeing anyone or anything. �There was noone in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind."" His troubles finally came to an end after getting directions from another man at a fish camp."	2	2		2																					
1598	3	The setting adds a sense of ergancy. The cyclist is running out of water and he is the middle of the dessert. If he had been in the forest or the subburbs it would not be so grave. He talks about passing out and dieing. He exclaims it did n�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds were going to pick me clean.�	2	2		2																					
1599	3	In the story, do not exceed posted speed limit by Joe Kurmaskie the cyclist was affected about the road ahead. He took advice that he thought was right but it was wrong. So it took him off track of his good he was trying to reach	1	1		1																					
1600	3	The way the settings affect the cyclist is very crucel. First, the cyclist took directions from someone who has not left thier porch in decades. So once he accepted the directions and used them problems occurred. One main problem is the cyclist has a lack of water supply. Also the cyclist has incounters with snakes. Another the directions where way off so he had longer to go then he thought. Also when he arrived from his journey he found a deserted town. So in conclusion the cyclest uses his own directions from now on.	2	2		2																					
1601	3	"As the setting changes in the story, so does the cyclist�s narrator�s mood. His mood changes from happy and confident to indifferent and scared. At first the cyclist is so happy about Yosemite that he is just care free and no worries at all. He says that, �I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� Even at his first �ghost town� he just �chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on�. After this point he could not be so care free. After this town he came to, �One ramshackle shed, several thirsty pumps, and men�. He said, �this was troubling�, it was very hot and he had been drinking his water pretty often. He said that, �He failed on."" He started to get sort of scared he realized that he could, ""drop from a heatstroke."" He was scared that because of his idea to believe the old men he might possibly die. He finally get happy when he reaches the bait shop and he got his drink. From then on the stock to his map. His attitude changed greatly throughout the story."	3	2		3																					
1602	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" the cyclist is affected alot by his surroundings. He is leaving the old water pump for Yosemite. �Not two miles flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water-depleting @NUM1.� This shows that as the terrain gets rougher and harder, how much harder it is for the cyclist to go on. Also, since he is already getting to the point at which he is getting dehydrated, it is that much harder for the already tired cyclist to go on any further more less make it all the way to Yosemite. That is how the terrain affects the cyclist.  "	2	2		2																					
1603	3	The setting affected the cyclist by making him very hot. He said he started sucking on stones because he heard that if you suck on stones it makes you not thirsty. He also said he might hit a bump and swallow one of the rocks. He said he wanted to swallow the rocks. The reason for that was that he was so hot. He didn�t even no where he was goin.	1	1		1																					
1604	3	The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the �towns� around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. 	2	1		2																					
1605	3	The features of the settings effects the cyclist by many reasons such as; dehydration, the road my cause bike to stop working. Since there is a lack of water in the dessert it seems, the guy could get dehydrated easily. The intense heat can cause that to. The road that he is riding on my cause the tires to pop.	1	1		1																					
1606	3	The cyclist was eager to get to Yosemite park he listened to the �old timers who haven�t left the confines of thier porches since Carter was in office�. He went the way the old men told him to take. He went down a hill in to town which was empty into a hard road & snakes in his way then up a hill then went down the hill saw a abanded �Welch�s Grape Juice Factory�. Then he saw a sign say �Gary And Wilber�s FISH CAMP-IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE�RE YOUR BEST BET!�. So then he runs into the bathroom & drinks from the sink. Before he got there he was getting thirsty & tired & when he saw the abanded building he saw a young boy drinking a juice he wiped his eyes to see if he wasn�t seen a mirage. So then he sticks a few pebbles into his mouth. It read that sucking on stones help take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. Then he left then a stone went his throat. His troubles, thirst, & fear were all behind him when he saw that sign.	2	2		2																					
1607	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. One feature of the setting was the heat. It affected him by getting him dehydrated. For example the text states,�The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips I could drop from a heatstroke � This meant the heat was getting to him.	1	1		1																					
1608	3	"The author made the setting seem long and unbearable, felt of undesirable heat and lack of water at hand. Specially in the way he kept describing the road with all these challenges that kept appearing like after @NUM1 miles to a town then @NUM2 miles passed that he, �came to a park of ???. One ramshackly shed, several rusty pumps and  a carrol that couldn�t hold in the hamest mule greeted me.This sight was troubling.� Then he went in a discharge, ""I was traveling strenght the high deserts of California in June. @CAPS1 ?? imagine, the heat, and unbareabalnes of the ??? journey still I face. @CAPS1 that bike seen endless.Then with a thrust gaining on him for example, ""I was doing a water-deplety 12 mph, sanctures life can seen be cruel. ""@CAPS1 him feel his constrain regrate on the journey @CAPS1 me feel his constrain sorrow for his endless journey he had to go through. Another example is, ""I riped the sweat from my eyes to make sure I wasn't a mirage"".

1609	3	In the story, �Do not exceed postal speed limit,� many features of the setting affect the cyclist. First and most importantly, he is affected by the people who live there. �Never accept travel advice from a group of old- timers who haven�t left the confines of their porch since Carter was in office.� This quote describes the feelings the cyclist has towards the old men. Because he listened to their directions, he traveled through ghost towns and hourly died from dehydration. Also, the lack of people and civilization affected the author. There was no one around that he could ask for help from. ��but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. Here, the author is trying to stop for water, but since no one lives in the town any more, he gets none. Finally, the lack of water has a huge effect on the cyclist. �That smoky blues tune �Summer time� rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain.� This describes how the author is really dehydrated and he feels like his brain is drying up. However, his need for water makes him more determined than ever to keep going until he reaches another town, or this goal destination of reaching Yosemite National Park.	3	3		3																					
1610	3	The features of the setting affect the man in many ways. One way is that when the man notices the terrain starting to change, he becomes more and more distrought. He  sees the sign that sats � Rough road ahead: Do not exceed pasted speed limit� it is almost as if he thinks the sign is mocking him. Also, when the rider says � In an @CAPS1 twist that should please all sadists�� he is telling the reader that this situation is very ironic and that he was expecting nothing.	1	1		1																					
1611	3	IIn the story I read the setting is a big factor to the affect of the cyclist for example it talks about how the cyclist see�s the sign that says, �Rough road ahead! Do not exceed posted speed limit.� So the cyclist has to be cautious	1	1		1																					
1612	3	The cyclist was is a horrible nasty environment for cycling, but the thing that really threw the cycle off was running out of water. There were no houses to refill his bottle or no one around to give him updated directions. From the heat made him drink more water and also harder to breath in extreme heat. Without those faults the cyclist would have been fine.	1	1		1																					
1613	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example he talks about things that he had to endure while he was riding. For example he had no water so he was parched. There was a huge snake that took up half of the road and there wasn�t a building in sight. So the setting affected him with doubt but he had confidence of getting where he needed to get then when he got there it was a sign of relif. Thats how the setting affected was.	1	2		2																					
1614	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist physically and mentally. They affected him physically because of the rough terrain and the heat because he was in a desert and in the mountains. Also because he didn�t follow his plan on the map he had no cloe where he was and so I think the anxiety of the whole thing took a toll on his physical well being. It affected him mentally because every town he passed through, or every building he passed was deserted and he had no idea where any people were so that had to stress him out. This mentally messed him and he thought he was going to die, thats not good for anyone. I really think he should just do what he thinks is right and not listen to crazy old men anymore. Maps don�t go crazy and they don�t really get outdated, and maps don�t lie to you so he obviously learned his lesson.	2	2		2																					
1615	3	Some of the features like the change in landscape affected the cyclist. Differing from flat land to miniture hills to highways is kind of hard to cope with, especially considering he was dehydrated and had no water.	1	1		1																					
1616	3	"The features of the setting in the essay �Rough Road Ahead.� affected the speaker by presenting challenges such as dehydration, dangerous animals and rough terrain in order to teach him a lesson about following travelling advice from old men. In the essay, he starts out confidently, on his journey after following �their advice�, reasoning that the men sounded �no sense of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off town."" The setting changes from cool to dry and barren with then mention of tumble weeds,� and even changed to dangerous with the appearance of a diamondback snake that blocked his path in the end the setting changes back to comfortable, allowing him to learn his lesson through the hardship of the features of the setting, and follow his own map from then on."	2	2		2																					
1617	3	"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is �This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June �(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)�. The hotness and heat had also increased the character�s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is �I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I�d be fine �(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."	3	3		3																					
1618	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water. another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down. lastly when he rehydrated himself in the  so the setting was a main factory to the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite national park."	2	1		2																					
1619	3	The cyclist chose to ride through the worst terrain one can ride through. The cyclist rode through deserts and deserted towns. Thats when he started to get thirsty. At first he wasn�t tired or thirsty because he was riding by cool trees and rushing water in the morning. Once he got to the desert part with no water source then he got thirsty and started to drink his water which depleted fast. The lack of a dry place can make you thirsty by itself but after riding a while it became bad. The setting had everything, to do on how the cyclist had no water and thought he was going to die from heatstroke. That�s how the setting affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1620	3	The setting affected the cyclist mood in the story. The cyclist was riding rough terrain and rolling hills. This made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless. When the cyclist arrived at the abandoned @CAPS1 Grape Factory he felt on twist of many. He was extremely thirsty and there used to be a @ORGANIZATION1 build there when the cyclist was a the fock in the road, he thought he could get some water. When this failed the cyclist was even less determined. He felt like the world was against him.	2	2		2																					
1621	3	The settings effected the cyclist, because where ever he went it seem to never end. Like when he was riding along where the old men told him to go. He went through a ghost town like they said he would go through a town. Then he kept on going but it never end and the summer heat started to get to him. Like when he started to dehidade he this old juice factor and started imagening that he was drinking juice. So he started seeing things.	1	1		1																					
1622	3	As the author cycles through this shortcut, he is in a very dangerous setting. As said in the poem, he is in the high deserts of California in June. A desert makes the heat unberable for the cyclist. Its just sun, sand, and him. Then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about @NUM1 almost maybe even hotter. This could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply. �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� Then there is the distance of his ride. The author is always saying �About @NUM2 miles� or �Twenty miles up the road.� All of this hard work can cause heatstroke & kill him.	2	2		2																					
1623	3	The features of the setting like the dessert the sun and abondered towns affect the cyclist alot. The dry dessert makes him feel as if he were riding forever. And probably makes him wonder if he is ever going to make it to a town. The sun makes hime even  hoter not  he already is makes him sweat more and makes him even more thirsty.The abandoned towns make him lose hope in finding water or even if he is ever doing to make to yosomite. The mood of this story goes from content to sad to happy. He is content after riding to the first town but then the rest of time towns are abandoned too and start to ran out of water an he thinks he is going to die which makes it sad. Then he becomes happy when he finds the bait shop an finds water.	2	3		3																					
1624	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist negatively. The story takes place in June in California. This is a very hot time of the year in such a desert location. The heat adds to the speed at which the cyclist becomes dehydrated, as well as his inability to think as coheratly as he could had he not been in a desert in June. The cyclist is also travelling through desolate, an inhabited land. The author says, �There was no one in sight, not a building car, or structure of any kind.� This emphasizes the characters total lack of resources. There is nowhere within sight that he can turn to for help, water, food or shelter. The road was also rough, plagued with many rolling, crippling hills. Such terrain is much harder to manuver, especially in such a are state of despair. The setting of the story, ""Rough Road Ahead"" greatly impacts the cyclist."	2	3		3																					
1625	3	There are a lot of things that effect the cyclist, such as the heat, having no water, the rough roads and the long trip. The cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot. The narriation says, �and the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated. The roads were very rough, for example, �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The roads became, bumpy, and there were a lot of hill the cyclist had to go over. There was no water either. So he/she was running out of energy and it made it even harder. In the end the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water.	2	2		2																					
1626	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a very harmful way. The hot temperature and boiling sun made the author hot and took his energy away quicker. The emptiness of the setting can make a person lose hope of finding any civilization. The narrator said, �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you...�(Kurmaskie @NUM1). That is not the last of the harmful setting, the dry desert air has the biggest impact on his llife. The dry air makes him more thirsty for water he doesn�t have making him dehydrate faster. The narrator saids, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The lonely and dreadful features of the setting the cyclist was part of made it so much worse that he had no water.	1	1		1																					
1627	3	In �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� a cyclist follows some bad advice, which leads him on a tough ride through the desert with little water. The setting has a large effect on the cyclist because it causes him to be dehydrated, which presents the main conflict of the story. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips,� the author states when his fresh water supply begins to run out. Another factor the setting presents to the cyclist is the extreme heat of the California desert. This adds to the cyclist thirst and dehydration. The reader can tell it is unpleasantly hot when reading, �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt�, that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June�� The rough roads and challenging terrain also present a challenge to the cyclist that slows his advance to Yosemite.	2	2		2																					
1628	3	The cyclist is affected by the features of the setting. The cyclists has been pedaling his bike in the direction that the old men told him to go to get to Yosemite. Soon he is out of water and very tired and he believes he will die soon. But then he finds a fish camp, goes in the bathroom to revive himself. when he comes out a man is sittiNg on the porch. The author gets directios from him and is happy that he is on the right track again.	1	2		2																					
1629	3	There are many affects of the setting in this eassy that, that can be good and or bad. The setting is alone on a empty mountain road, with no house, no cars, no people. In now going to give you some good and bad effects. One good effect is that you by yourself so while you exercise you can relax and enjoy the energy. One bad thing is that what if you pop a tire or need help. You stock because theirs no one around. Another good thing is that you being by yourself, @CAPS1 any cars. You don�t have to worry about getting hit so you�ll be able to just relax and enjoy the ride . Another bad thing is there is no water so you might want to bring plenty with you. So whatever you decide to do just be careful and think you idea thought  	1	1		1																					
1630	3	The setting or environment the cyclist was in made him feel isolated from the rest of the world. He knew the was no turning back once he started his adventure. No one was their to help him. The environment made him to realize the many risk involved in this adventure. The knowledge that there is no help was his motive to continue on his long journey.	1	1		1																					
1631	3	"The features of the setting make the cyclist feel hopeless after realizing he is not on a short cut. The cyclist has the ""growing realization that [he] could drop from heatstroke"" as he rides along. Also, the only building he sees for miles ""had been @NUM1 Welch's Grape Juice Factory."" The cyclist is driven deeper into despair and feels that all hope is lost when he sees this building. As he rides on, the song ""'@ORGANIZATION2' rattled aroung in the dry honeycombs of (his) deteriorating brain."" At this point, the cyclist believes his own death to be inevitable. He saysown death to be inevitable. He says �with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat� when talking about pebbles he placed in his mouth. Finally, the cyclist reaches a small bait shop, and all hope is returned as he �drank deeply from the sink.� The desert setting, with its lack of water, shelter, and people was the cause of this mans concern and later panic about his own life. The hopelessness of this cyclist is much like the hopelessness of those in the @ORGANIZATION1, who trapped in a blizzard far from civilization, resorted to eating their dead just to survive. While the @PERSON1 @ORGANIZATION1 went to extremes for their survival, their setting caused them to feel the same hopelessness as the cyclist."	3	3		3																					
1632	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affects the cyclist because he has to cross different types of land marks. First, he got information from the old people. For example, when he showed the map to the old people their only going to know the old short cuts not the new ones. Second, when he ran out of water. For instance, when the cyclist ran out of water he had to climb hills and that tired him out. Plus when he tried to get water from that one thing only hot water come out last, when he finally got to a story the old guy had a map. For example, when he asked the old guy about the place he was going to he said I have my own map. So therefore he knew he was in trouble. In  conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1633	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. The setting was verry hot and there were a lot of hills. The cyclist had been riding up and down hills all day and it took a lot of energy when he saw the building that he thought could help him he said, �... last burst of energy, i mane'uvered down the hill,� By saying that it showed that the setting of where he was contained a lot of hillsy and they effected him by taking up all his energy. That is how the setting had effected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1634	3	"In the short story Rough Road ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted  Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affects the cyclist. When at the old codgens house, he is confident in himself, because they have told how of a shortcut to Yosemite, giving that confidence he needs, as he leaves, he is still confident, these as the settings changes, so does the mood of the cyclist. after ""about @NUM1 miles into te pedal"", the cyclist arrives at the first town, he has despair because it is a ghost town,"" still having confidence, he lack of water, he continues on. after a couple more miles, he comes to small fork with a pump. Thinking its cool, water he goes and pump, he finds out it is @NUM2�@CAPS1 and tastes like ""battery acid"". Now he desparate, no water, dehydrated, and no towns around, he began to pedal and pedal, hoping to find a town around. When he does find a town, with water, the setting to relieving and better for him because he find water. In the end, the setting effect how the cyclist back against confident, then desperate as water is used, than relieved when water is found."	3	3		3																					
1635	3	This would be a hard risk to begin with, but the cycalist is taking it in the desert. As we all know, the desert can get boiling hot, so a bike ride could get enjoyable quickly. Also, when the only thing you see for miles is rode, sand and an empty factory, your moral can easily dray quickly. It�s just an overall way setting to give lost in.	1	1		1																					
1636	3	The effect of cyclist is very and treding becose alot of thing can go worrs like you can feel so hot have and water wouldn�t cool down it didn�t matter. But when drop in you mouth had the flavor of battery acid. He or anyone could just drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeus day in June. So hot that you are seeing thing like a town hot pouring a refeshing glass of juice into his mouth could still leave.  	1	1		1																					
1637	3	The features of the setting dramatically affected the cyclist. He started out in a confident mood, until he arrived at a town that was deserted. His confidence was still pretty high but not like it was prior to coming upon the ghost town. Twenty miles up the road after that, he came to a fork in the road which contained a ramshackle shed rusty, unclean pumps, and a small corral. The desert was hot and his lack of water was dehydrating him. Paragraph @NUM1 states, �This sight was troubling�I had been hitting my water bottles regularly, and was traveling through the high deserts in California.� With little water and a short energy supply he was getting tired and dehydrated quickly. The land started turning into rolling hills and caused him to become even more exhausted. His mood had gone from confident to hopeless. He even planned on changing a diary entry in case he died of heatstroke. The features obviously greatly affected the mood of the cyclist. Sometimes disappointment can come from taking the so-called �easy way out.� 	1	1		1																					
1638	3	In the story the setting affected the cyclist all through the story till he arrived at body and wilbers fish camp. As the man rides his bike for a while he is of but as he road into the first town it seemed to be a ghost town. As he pedal on � The sun was beginning to beat down but I barely noticed it�. At that time the wheater is affecting him a lot but he keeps Yosemite cool pines and rushing rivers in his head He also only had only a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottle while going up a big hill.	2	1		3																					
1639	3	The setting of this Essay is to tell cyclest were to go without getting them lost and to never take advice from old people.	1	1		1																					
1640	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist, the setting was hot and rough terrain and he was tired and thirsty. The cyclist said, �over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view.� He this means that he needed water so much and the hill was so big that he needed water. Also he says, �Summertime �rattled around in the dry honey combs of my deteriorating brain�. It is summer time where he is riding and to keep his mind off of his thirst, he hums the song �summertime� He wants to show that the heat cannot overtake his body. Also he says, �At some point, tumble weeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� He is saying that the terrain is deadly because of the snake that passed by him. He needed to show with all objections, he could overcome anything. As you can see the setting greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1641	3	Many things can affect a cyclist. But in the story three main features of the setting affected the cyclist the most. While the cyclist was riding it was very hot. We know this by looking back at the text. It gives us this quote, �That I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� Because it was hot. This could make the cyclist thirsty. Another feature of the setting was the multitude of hills. This would create exhaustion. We know their were many hills because in the text it says.� Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.� Going over all those hills can really tire someone out. A third feature of te setting would be nature. Nature can affect us in many ways, by weather, by terrain, as in this case by animals. In the story the cyclist comes upon a large snake. This making it dangerous. The setting can affect anything. It would have been a totally different story if the cyclist had been in the summer during @DATE1, not June.	3	3		3																					
1642	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @CAPS1,� the setting is used to alter the cyclists mood and as a reflection of his situation. For example, the statement �the cool pines and rushing river of Yosemite had my name written all over them� helps describe the cyclist situation. The idea of lush, cool water vegetation gives the @CAPS4 hope during his increasinlgly hellish trip. The beauty of that setting also reflects on the comfort that would come from reaching Yosemite; the good setting equal a good out come. Later on, the cyclist comes across �one ramshackle shed, several rusts pump, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest make.� This is a depressing setting symbolizing a complete loss of hope. And inteact at this point the cyclist becomes troubles to his situation. While pedaling through desert, the cyclist becomes even more factory when tumble seed, which is always a symbol of a deserted area, cones by. The nile of setting to affect and mirror mood is nothing new. There are many examples of this literary technique throughout history. For example, in his story �The @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 @PERSON1.� @CAPS4 @PERSON1 was a deslated land filled wild beast to symbolize and cause @PERSON2 to change his personalith surrounded by uncivilized people and creating @PERSON2 tears of his clothes and hunt like a dog. The setting of a desert in the uncultured. Part of colonial simultaneously cause and reflects on this change. The setting in the essay �Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit� is used as an important for character development.  	3	3		3																					
1643	3	The features of the essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. When the author writes tumbleweeds crossed my path� it shows that he is most likely in the middle of nowhere. This is true because tumbleweeds are usually signs in movies and t.v. shows that the place is deserted. Also, when the author writes� the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke� and when he writes �a ridiculously large snake� show the growing danger that he is getting himself into. This is true because the snakes could get a tany time or he could just collapse from the lack of water and die. Lastly, the name of the store is revelant because it is a fish bait store and he is thirsty. This is revelant because fish live in water and he is thirsty and seeing the sign relieves him completely. Therefore, the features of this essay explain how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
1644	3	The cyclist is faced with many challenges on his journey to Yosemite, one of which is travelling through the California deserts. This was quite a challenge because a desert is very hot and dry, plus the author was riding his bike, making  himself more thirsty and hot. He also encountered a big snake that appeared to be a diamondback which he avoided even though it almost covered the road. The author also had to deal with rough terrain when he rode his bike through the hills. The biker met the challenges and progressed through them with bravery.	2	2		2																					
1645	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed Speed limit� this many different settings took its toll on the cyclist. For example in the beginning he started out with a nice smooth ride. But it was very hot. Then he began to get into a hort rolling hills which were taking thier toll on his legs. Then we entered into a rough are where he had to be more careful. The roughness prolly wore him out from all the bumps and bounces. He went through a lot on that bike trip, who know he @MONTH1 have never made at back to where he was staying.	1	1		1																					
1646	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making it harder for him to pedal and complete his ride. For example, �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� This should make his trip harder because instead of being able to pedal at one consistent rate the whole time, he would have to start pedaling harder and easier over and over again, using more energy. Another example is, �through the high deserts of California in June.� This makes it harder for him because he has to do all his work in a scorching summer heat. Finally, the first three stops he made had no where to fill his water bottles, take a drink, or cool off. This would make it hard because he is becoming dehydrated during his whole trip. These are some features of the setting that affect the cyclist by making his trip harder.	2	2		2																					
1647	3	One feature that effected the cyclist was the rolling hills. The  �text states � two miles into the section... I noticed  the terrain changing�	1	1		1																					
1648	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting affects the story very much for many reasons. First, it is in the summer, so it is very hot. Also, it is in the desert in the west, so there is a very warm climate already. Third, there is not any civilization on the �shortcut� he follows, so there is no way for the author to get any water to replenish his body with. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story.	1	2		2																					
1649	3	The setting affects the cyclist a lot, because is it was windy too it would be had for the cyclist to control the bike. So is  too has a lot as buildings and people outside their would be a lot as traffic so they would not  be allowed to let the cyclist go there so the cyclist would  has to turn back. Then if it was a clear road  and nobody was there ad no bulidings or houses were there then it wold be an easy ride for the cyclist. So as you can see the setting affects the cyclist in many ways.	0	1		1																					
1650	3	The cyclist was affected majorly by a few dreadful parts of the setting. In the beginning, when it was not as hot and he had plenty of water, the cyclist was absolutely fine. As the day went on, he felt the heat bearing down on him. He drank all his water, and now he felt desperate. His mood changed with the setting, and he was extremely happy once he reached Gary and @ORGANIZATION1. Also, this cyclist decided to blame the old men for giving him bad directions when he was in trouble, but he thanked them once he realized they were correct.	2	2		2																					
1651	3	If it�s a good day the cyclist will want to rid. If it is a bad day then they will not want to but probably will.	3	3		3																					
1652	3	In the essay, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit by Joe Kurmaskie, features of setting affect the cyclist because there is old people that been around for along time and you can�t ask for advice because they�re to old old to give information and wouldn�t know what their talking about. �A better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches sine Carter was in office.� That is the features of the setting and examples from the essay.	1	1		1																					
1653	3	The features for the cyclist in rough road ahead is not the kind l�D  war a be in at forts. I thought it was going to be  a scenery story but it turns out he want that prepared. He took directions from some olden guys who haven�t left their house sense carter was in office. He was a bike peddaling threw the California desert with the things you can carry cause your on a bike. He ran out of water and could of got heatstroke or colapsed in the middle of nowhere with no one around to save him. So the heat gone drive you insane and make you thirty and you have a bite. The conditions this biker is in  hormone and I dont think he was prepared. Always stick in your gut.	3	2		3																					
1654	3	In the story the fact that no one was around, there were no buildings, he had no water, and was lost. Had a negative affect on the cyclist, he was doubting himself the whole time. Although he did perserver and made it through the tough situation he was in.	1	1		1																					
1655	3	In the story �rough road ahead� the setting and the features affect the cyclist. For example in the story he says �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you had left to circulate�. This shows that the features are rough because he would most likely not be that desperatly thirsty unless it was very hot out. The setting and features of this story is it takes place in California, on a hot day. Another quote that could support the question is when the author says, �I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage.� This shows that it is hot because he is sweating. This also could show that it is hot because he thinks it�s a mirage, and people usually see them in the desert, where it is hot.	2	2		2																					
1656	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. To begin, the as the cyclist rode on for the first miles, he did not see anything in sight. This made him less determined to reach his goal. Then, in paragraph @NUM1, the cyclist saw a building which helped him to gain strength to reach his goal. The cyclist�s determination went down as long as he was riding. But then at last he came to a building that gave him relief and more confidence in himself.	2	1		2																					
1657	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by him dehydrating and running out of time and energy. �I eased past trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state� This quote proves the dehydration of the rider. �The glowing realization that I could die from a heat stroke,� this quote proves the time and energy of the rider is running out. These ideas and quotes show the features of the setting of the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1658	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about. After the ride didn�t turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to �set in�. The aridity of the climate would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with but the scorching sun would make him become dangerously dehydrated.	1	2		2																					
1659	3	The  cyclist  runs  into some pretty tough challenges. The real vies of the setting affected him, because there was so many optical that he had to overcome, for  example, he  got directions  from some old men who move then lively didn�t really know what they were talking about. Then he ran out of water so he had nothing to drink and the road started to get bumpily and he saw snakes. There were no buildings nor cars around so he had no way of asking anybody for help if needed. He came  up on an old factory, that was thought to be the Welch�s Grape juice, factory, but was abandoned and looked like it had been for a while, towards the end he found this fish came where he finally got water and was around people. These different optical affected his mood and how determined he was.	3	2		3																					
1660	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� has a great effect on the main character in the story. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first �town� and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him. �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.� His mood at this point was already confident, but this adds to it, with words like �rushing� being encouraging to him. Then, he continues moving on the road. �Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.� At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isn�t what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. �This adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him. Then he said �over the long crippling hill, a building came into view.� It is at this point that he uses the word �crippling� because he is just about exhausted and can�t go any further.	2	2		2																					
1661	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist. He is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird. After that he starts to ride through the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more. When he arrives at the abandoned juice factory he is almost completely out of energy and almost can�t go on any further in his journey until he finally arrives at the bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him.	2	2		2																					
1662	3	The cyclist was begging to feel that death was coming his way as he continued withought a building in sight. This made him grow histerical over the situation, and still have enough energy to feel sorry for himself. Then when he finally did see a building he thought it was a mirage.	1	1		1																					
1663	3	The location of a cyclist�s ride affects the person�s attitude and strength. If the road is full of hills, it takes a little more strength to maintain speed. When put in this situation, Kurmaskie writes �It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� This shows how one gets drained by hills. Also, being in a desert situation can weaken a cyclist due to thirst.The cyclist in the reading was desperate enough to try pump water that looked �brackish.� So, setting can break a cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1664	3	The setting in the passage is working against the cycler. Hes running low on water hes almost dehydrated and the weather were hes at is very very hot and he cant see a town for miles.	1	1		1																					
1665	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist because it was really hot out, he had very little amount of water, and a long way to go. The temperature was so hot, the cyclist said he felt dehydrated. He also had to go over a lot of hills and go through deserts to get where he needed to go. He took a �shortcut� but it ended up taking longer and he got dehydrated. This is how the setting affected him.	2	2		2																					
1666	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the good way. For examples he would be in good shape because cycling is a sport. He would be rich because he would win the contest of cycling.	0	0		0																					
1667	3	In the essay by Joe Kurmaskie many obstacles are caused from the diffrent settings. For example, the hot temperature caused the character to get dehydrated. He recalled � I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. � This caused the loss of determination, which led to him lossing his consciousness. The hills he had to cycle also effected him. They caused him to become tired and weak and to lose his determination, as well. Just like the temperature problem, the loss of determination could eventually  make him lose consciousness. He said � if it looked like i was going to lose consciousness for the last time.�  	2	1		2																					
1668	3	The setting of the story had effected the cycle�s becuse if it was sub earbs he could have stoped any where and got water but the plot was in a middle of a desert and all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water For example, he had to go @NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water and if he was not in the desert with hills he could have made that in no time at all    	1	1		1																					
1669	3	The cyclist was affected by many features of the setting. The flat road soon became bumpy hills, which were made harder to cycle because of lack of water. The hot desert sun and lack of towns and people also made the journey difficult.	1	1		1																					
1670	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist because it is to hot. It is hot enough that his water tasts like battery acid.  Then he has to deal with difficult trails breakway he said �old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.� This is sayin that the old-timers gave him old directions. Plus what made the setting even hotter was he has been cycling nonstop. Then when he was riding he said �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.� With him thinking about this it made him forget about the heat. This was why the setting was affecting the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1671	3	There are many reasons as to why the features of the setting affects the cyclist. One reason is because it is so hot, I know this because it was sammertime in the California desert. Another reason is because the road was very rough. I know this because of the sign that he saw that said �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed @NUM1). This tells you that the road is very rough. And being that he is on a bike rough roads are not very good for him. Another reason as to why the setting affects the cyclist is that there is no one to get directions from. There is no one around to give him a drink of water. These are few of the many reasons why the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1672	3	The setting of this story is outside. Yosemite is outside riding her bike. She is around hills, no water, and very hot land. You know that she is around hills because she says to herself, �� I maneuvered down the hill.� You also know that she starts of around no??? ???good water. �When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid�� that shows the water was bad. Also the land is very hot because it says ��in the??? ???of two hundred degrees.� Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemite�s biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid. 	1	1		1																					
1673	3	There are many things that could affect affect the cyclist. Like when they said ,� tomble weeds crossed my path is a ridiculously large snake.� @CAPS1 her example would be when they said� Not two miles into this next section of the ride I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. That is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1674	3	"The stoy of the cyclist features of the setting affect of the cyclist, The cyclist had to go thoug a lot "" The speed limit was @NUM1. The was doing a water depleting @NUM2, Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� The cyclist love ride their bike they enjoyed the serenity of an early summer evening"" to cycling."	1	1		1																					
1675	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist. First, the river and the pine trees �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them"". Thinking about that helped the cyclist keep going. Second, the road was getting harder to travel. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" and a sign on another road said �rough road ahead� The roads made the cyclist work harder to get to Yosemite National Park. Finally, the cyclist's water supply was running low. �the water bottles contained only a few tantalizing  sips.� Not having a lot of water is really bad when your outside in the heat and the cyclist had no idea where to find more. The towns the cyclist ran into were abandon or �ghost town�. The cyclist had nowhere to go to get help. This cyclist faced many problems during his bike ride to Yosemite national park."	2	3		3																					
1676	3	The older men gave him directions that were acctully really bad. Nature wasn�t on is side that�s for sure. First of all he ran out of water because of the heat. Secondly a snake blocked his path and he didn�t want to tempt it. Thirdly he became so overheated that it was possible for him to suffer a heat stroke in the middle of nowhere. Also he kept going to abandoned buildings. It was so bad that the stone relied on for his thirst got stuck in his throat, he was then lead to a bait shop that was absolutely in the middle of nowhere and he had no way of getting home.	2	1		2																					
1677	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist. The dry desert affected the cyclist because these was no water and the cyclist was dehydrated. The strong heat, because the cyclist could bare had a heat stroke. The animals because the snake could have killed the cyclist and these was no one in miles to help. In the story it says, �These was no one in sight, not a bulling, car or structure of any kind,� If the cyclist had needed help then the  cyclist could most likely have died. if I was the cyclist, I probably would have given up by then but I�m glad the cyclist didn`t. The features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the many things that could make happened to him.	2	2		2																					
1678	3	The features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the heat because he was getting lost and he was slowly running out of water. The cyclist said, �That you should never accept travel advice from old timers that haven�t left their porches since Carter was in office�. This means that because the cyclist followed their advice he got lost in the desert and was running very low on water. He was thirsty that he put stones in his mouth to keep him from thinking about water. In the end the cyclist learned to trust the map and the signs instead of listening to really old people who haven�t left their homes in years.	2	2		2																					
1679	3	The setting of the desert is a hard setting to be in with no water or help. If the author would have been on a population trait with water fountain and shade, he would have been fine. But, he was in the desert no one around, hot, dry, no water, and no shade. �tumbleweeds crossed my path� (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This dicride his loneleness because no one was in the desert to help him. The setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp. The setting had a huge affected on the author.	2	2		2																					
1680	3	The feature in the short story affect the cyclist because with no towns around there is now water. In the story is says, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� This means the cyclist was short on water and needed to find a town soon. Cycling in the desert and up down hills made it harder and hotter. The heart could cause dehydration or a heatstroke because it says, �and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke� the buildings the cyclist did see were not any help to him because they had no water. Eventually he came to a fishing camp and found water in the sink of the bathroom. The story says, �I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink.� This is where the setting changes because the cyclist found cool water finally.	2	2		2																					
1681	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the author faces many obstacles because of the different terrain changes on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclist�s physical state, but his mood and determination as well.  "	3	2		3																					
1682	3	"The setting affect the cyclist in many ways. ""The journey nass make an snake this quote and that there made it seem like he is in the middle of know were and is ulcoming no plass because the man on the pourch said it would not be to far. The first town also was empty and when saw the town he was excited to go and feel a little out when he got closer he realized that the town has been abandoned this whole time so he was forced to keep going out the empty town made him feel almost hopless. In his attempts to make it to that next town, that how the setting mos affected the cyclist in the way that it did."	2	2		2																					
1683	3	The setting of the road affected the cyclist in many different ways. Because there were no towns on the road it made it very difficult for him to find water which led him into a dehydrated state. �The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so. The rolling hills of the road were making him use more energy. Because there was no buildings for miles be broke the ride into short distances	2	1		2																					
1684	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in so many ways. Some ways the cyclist was affected is, the lack of water was the biggest problem he had. The group of the old guys that gave him directions werent a big help at all. The men gave the cyclist directions be what they remember when they were younger in age. The cyclist knew not to take directions from the old men, but they seemed so sure about what they were talking about to him. The cyclist first had determination to get to his destination. As he begin to get hotter and more thirster into giving up. As soon as he was about to give up his troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind him now. He stumbled across water.	2	2		2																					
1685	3	The features in the setting affect the cyclist in many different ways. One way is he is round stuck with only a little bit of water. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.(Kurmaskie). Also the cyclist was lost because of the old men directions that got him know where because there directions were out of date. �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confine of their porches since carter was in office,� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He was giving bad directions and wasnt to pleased. Therefore the cyclist went through some though times.	1	2		2																					
1686	3	Different features of the settings affect the cyclist. The setting of the story, which is based in the desert has a negative affect on the character. �The desert land is baron, leaving him only with his small supply of water. During his journey he runs out of water causing him to lose contact with reality. The extreme heat in the desert causes him to begin to hallucinate. The cyclist begins to see a grape juice factory, which interrupts his trip. To his dismay, it turns out to be a no more than a mirage. The lengthy road also affected the trip. The length and roughness of the road had worn the cyclist down.	1	1		1																					
1687	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he thinks after a nice afternoon in a nice campground a shortcut to his next destination would be very nice. He thinks the shortcut will be a nice way to relax than to take the original longer way to Yosemite. But the trip he makes changes his mind a lot. In the essay the narrator is talking about what the old guys had told him. He says, �The old guys had sworn the next town only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that. I would conserve my water�� He did conserve his water but the town was very old and didn�t have any water for him to drink. So throughout the essay the narrator went without water until he got to a factory, got some water to drink, and got new directions. The trip was very different from what he had expected. It was more depressing.	3	3		3																					
1688	3	A response that explains how the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Would be that in the setting in the setting affected cyclist because for one the features of setting was based on something else. So that would be a reason how it would be affected. Because they're is differences in the stories.	0	0		0																					
1689	3	You came alway choose your features because you idea mind be change over time.	0	0		0																					
1690	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist mentally, physically, positively and negatively. For instance, had been do @CAPS1's Grape Juice Factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy by pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still been seen."" This affected the author mentally, making him remember he had no water. Which inturn affected him physically by becoming dehydrated as moments passed. So overall that setting features had a negative direction affect on the cyclist. Another example, ""One ramshacked shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling."" This affected the cyclist mentally by making him think he was never going to see civilization again. It also affected him physically because the water tasted like ""battery acid"" which put him deeper into his dehydration state. This setting features had a negative affect on the cyclist. The setting features and had they affected the cyclist is like an environment a person is adised in and how it makes them who they are."	3	2		3																					
1691	3	He is going on a journey on his bike. He has to go down hills and deal with the factt that has has no water. That�s basically what the setting is about.	3	2		3																					
1692	3	When riding a bike the features around you can affect the cyclist. Some things that can affect the cyclist are weather and scenery. If the weather is cold and rainy the cyclist would not want to be riding. The dangers of riding when the weather conditions are bad will make the cyclist second guest: riding or not. If the weather is extremely hot the cyclist will get dehydrated quicker and even more exhasted. The scenery can also affect the cyclist. When a cyclist is riding and all he/she sees is a desert then they might have doubts on where there going. If there are abandon buildings everywhere the cyclist @MONTH1 become frighten and want to head back of lose hope as shown in the story �Do not exceed the speed limit� when he gets over a hill and begins to think that he will never make it to Yosemite. Many things can affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1693	3	"The features of the setting exhuberate the cyclist. The June weather added to the water depletion, being the beginning of summer, when the cyclist �arrived at the first �town�"" it was deserted, and the water had disgusting water. The author uses verbal irony when calling it a town �town� having it not really be a town anymore. The large snake presented an air of danger and another abandoned Grape Juice Factory added to the hopeless lost tone. "	2	2		2																					
1694	3	Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone than the cyclist would have tirerd less quickly making his journey easyer. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1695	3	"The features of the setting in, ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� affect the cyclist in many ways. After following the old mens' advice he sets off on his journey. After the first town appears the sun realy starts to beat down which realy affects the cyclist. In the essay it says �The sun was beginning to heat beat down, but I barely noticed it.� He @MONTH1 have not noticed it yet but then later on the long winding road on the new flat terrain he runs out of water and that is real dangerous in weather that hot. The text says, �The speed limit was @NUM1. I was doing a water- depleting @NUM2.� In this part of the story it proves that the cyclist is out of water. In this kind of setting you can run into dangerous creatures. In the story it says, �I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake. It really did look like a diamondback-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� This entry proves to the reader that there are snakes in this sort of setting. The features of the setting in �Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� affects the cyclist greatly."	2	3		3																					
1696	3	The terrain setting effect the cyclist in many ways. The fast that he was in a desert made him thirsty. There was no towns any sign of water to quench his thirst. The hills he would dtwepend than heartycle town just  made him moretired. These what the setting did to the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1697	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed� by @PERSON1, the cyclist faces problems caused by the setting. The biker was riding and the heat was scourching and the biker was really getting dehydrated and tired and he was running out of water. Because it was so hot the biker had to drink more water to replenish his body of all the sweat he was loosing while biking. The hills of the terrain were making it harder on the biker by making him us more energy and liquid to keep going. If it had been cool and breezy he would have had no problem making that distance. If the surrounding area was full of people and not abandoned towns than he would have had water to drink.	1	1		1																					
1698	3	"Every body experiences physical and emotional pain, but most probably wouldn't have survived what the cyclist in this story went through. The man started a bike ride Yosemite National park, but when some eldrerly men told him a short cut, his adventure had just because. First at all, every ""town""and ""building"" the men told him he would come to, would come to, wound up being completely desserted. At first this wasn't a big deal to the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph when he came to his first desserted town he, ""chuckled, checked [his] water town supply, and moved."" @CAPS1, as his journey progressed, his water decreased.He was then in desperation for a town.On topof thatin the story he wrote, ''the tast roadwas replaced short, rolling hills. ""This made his biking harder and he was then becoming denyarated. He finally found a town with water, but learned his lesson from taking advice from strangers and old men. "	3	3		3																					
1699	3	"The features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot. There is a man who takes the advice of old men and takes a �shortcut� to Yosemite Park. The shortcut only leads him to thirst, and no park. The narration states, �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth couldstill be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""This feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him. the cyclist comes to the first �town� but only finds yet again no water, and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey. Another feature that @MONTH1 affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back. The narration states, �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.(Kurmaskie @NUM1).� This also makes the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about."	2	3		3																					
1700	3	"There are many features of the setting that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit,"" The time of year affected the cyclist because it�s mid June, @CAPS1 the region affected the cyclist because mid June in arizona is extremely hot and try. If it was in a more northern state in @DATE1 or I, ll it wouldn�t be as bad and you world not have the dance of a heat struggles. @CAPS1 when the terrain changed from flat to hills this affected him because it made it harder for him the to ride. These are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit."""	1	1		1																					
1701	3	In  rough raod ahead by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Because he was in the desert of California in June, he water supply was emicated and he came across a ghost town. His hope was dwindling because of this. He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map. That is how the feature affected the setting.	2	2		2																					
1702	3	In the essay, �Rough Road A head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First of all, he was traveling in the @CAPS1 which means it was very dry. This meant that the cyclist could not refill his water and was slowly getting dehydrated. Also, the cyclist was biking in the heat. This meant that he was continuesly sweating which also depleted his water from his body and played tricks on his mind. Finally the hills caused him to exact more energy furthermore making him more and more dehydrated. The hills also put a damper on his spirits, which made him have to muster a lot of inner strength and determination to keep going. This part of the setting affected him emotionally. Overall the setting had a physical and emotion effect on him.	2	3		3																					
1703	3	The cyclist is alone traveling on a flat land at first following the direction in which the old men told him to get to Yosemite National Park in @LOCATION1. During his travels he becomes dehydrated cycling over hills and deserts with othe sun beating down on him in such hot weather of June, he realizes he could get a heart stroke without water. His travels are desolate and lonely and when he finally sees building which are realy ghost towns he recovers and finds some determination to speed up. The cyclist luckily found a camp site to save him from passing out in a desert where he could rest, get water, then carry on his journey using his own map.	3	2		3																					
1704	3	In the story �Do not exceed posted speed Limit�, the cyclist is trying to get to Yosemite with directions that some codgers, or eccentric old men, gave him. The cyclist, said the old men looked as though they, �haven�t left the confines of their poaches since carter was in office. �  Well, he takes their advice, and he gets lost about @NUM1 along on his journey. While looking forward to the �Cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite�� he was traveling through a barren desert. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� This type of setting could really bring down a cultist�s mood while thinking of Yosemite. It could make him lose all hope of ever finding Yosemite at this rate. If you have a nice setting, it makes the trip worthwhile, and your ending point even better.	1	1		1																					
1705	3	The setting effected the performence of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist. The rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them. �over one long, crippiling hill, a building came into view.� The long, big hills that he had to go up and made him more thirsty, but probably more satisfied when it was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. This brought his hopes down. But continued to move on. In my life, I have never had such an experience to where I had to keep pushing and urging myself to my goal, but the closes I got, the more distractions got in the way to and stop me.	2	3		3																					
1706	3	�Do not exceed posted speed limit�, is a short story about a man who is bicycling through Yosemite and he asks some elderly men for direction and they lead him in this �old� shortcut that takes him through tough terrain and extreme famine. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways throughout the story for example when the bicyclist came to a deserted area he said �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. By this time he was malnourished & in need of water this extreme thrist also reselted in him passing an abandoned Welch�s grape juice factory with an advertisement with a young boy pouring a fresh glass of juice in his mouth. He says �In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building,�, then he goes into detail about the building, this mood & feeling by this time was tired and worn out and the advertisement didn�t help the situation at all. The authors mood did change with the setting and before it got better it was worse.	3	2		3																					
1707	3	"The young cycolist began his day confident in looking forward to his day of riding across california, slowly, however as he recognizes his been directed wrongly, his mood changes,& he begins to feel more hopless. AS he begins, he feels carefree & mody for anything. He writes ""I checked, checked my water supply & moved on. The sun was beginning to heat down, not I barely noticed it. The surroundings have little effect on him. Later, on he realizes his water was going down, & he is getting tired, his mood changed to exhaustion & defect. Here he writes �i got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles & stuch them in my mouth with any luck I�d hit a bump of lodge one in my throat.� He has become sarcastic of saddened by the hoplessness of his journey. Eventually, he had relief of the cold water helps to bring up his spirits & sense of humor"	3	3		3																					
1708	3	In the essay the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the begginning the setting was at the old man�s place and the cyclist was happy and confident. When he reached the ghost town and was out of water he was upset and frustrated. When he saw the building he was relived but when he found out it was abandoned he was sad. When he finally reached the store he was excited and relived. That is how the setting affected the cyclist during his trip	2	2		2																					
1709	3	Weather, places, the will to continue � all are reason that explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. First the weather will affect the cyclist because in hot weather you lose a lot of water and you sweat a lot making it hard to pedal. The sunny hot weather will affect his will to ride.  I mean come on who wants to ride when its burning hot outside the places the cyclist went through like towns and rough roads would affect him because it�s pretty tough.	1	2		2																					
1710	3	The story �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted, speed limit � tells of a biking trip gone wrong. But the story would  not be as terrifying if it had happend in a different place. The setting plays a large role in the story. The story begins on a present summer evening but as the man bikes he arrives at ghost town devold of evil life, later feeling of double sets In when he arrives at �one ramshockle shed, severall rusty pumps and a corrol that couldn�t hold these lamest mule. � later we fear panic set in as these terrain becomes hilly and tumbleweeds and snakes cross the path. Like an cold wesstern. Finally all  hope is lost when he reaches these grapes Juice factory and fInd, �a sand blasted picture of a Young boy, � The setting is a power full tool which greatly influences the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
1711	3	"In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected they cyclists physical abilities. The features affected is abilities, because the climate and dangerous environment was hot and rough to handle. These features were hot and rough 'Since he was in the California deserts in June. The passage that supports this is,�. Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Also, the features of the setting give him determination. They give him determination, because each horizon he sees gives him hope. They give him hope since he knows he is that much @NUM1 to Yosemite National Park. The passage that supports this is when he drops,"".distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that @CAPS1 could move it that far, I�d be fine.� In the story,"" Rough road ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of his settings affect both they cyclists physical and mental abilities"	2	3		3																					
1712	3	"The features of the setting have a huge effect on the cyclist. There was a point in the story where he ran out of water ad he remembered that the old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the rode. He was tired ad dehydrated but he thought he could make it along the road. So he started off and the two miles later the terrain changed and so did his outlook on this entire journey. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. ""Sometimes life can be so cruel.� @CAPS1 hills took a lot out of him and he was now on a highway. Before this terrain change the rider is very positive and thinks he can do this easily. �I could make that!� But after the terrain change he looses hope and almost don�t make it. �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It is obvious as you read that when the terrain becomes tough it has a huge negative effect on the cycilists."	3	2		3																					
1713	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist in a few ways. The roads were nice and smooth then turned to hills. It was a hot day in June and he had a sparse water supply with him. He was peddling through the desert�s of California. The last thing that effected him was that there wasn�t very many places to stop for water.	1	1		1																					
1714	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, a cyclist is on his way trying to find his way to Yosemite National Park, but runs into a little trouble when getting directions from a couple of older men. The one lesson the cyclist learned was to never to listen to short-cuts given to you by old men who are extremly out of date and haven�t left their pourch since Carter was in office. The cyclist learned this the hard way when he ends up lost and almost died of thirst. The setting takes place in the desert of California or in deserted ghost towns. One his journey the cyclist says ��I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� This feature effects the cyclist because of the extremely dry heat beating down on him makes him dehydrated. Also along his journey the cyclist encounters hills. The feature of the setting effects the cyclist by tiring him out and making him believe there isn�t any hope of him getting out alive. Features of the setting like hills and deserts dehydrates a	2	2		2																					
1715	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. It seems to be the more despirate the situation the more determand her becomes. Pg @NUM1 (I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean). Right after he thinks this he climbed away for the abandoned factory of Juices and dreams. He says pg @NUM1 come troubles, thirst and tean where all behind me, this shows that after a situation the bilaver tells realeoved of all earthley obligations. Not only does the settings affect the cyclist but the entire story around him.	2	2		2																					
1716	3	The setting of the story, are very dry and humid, and flat, and hilly. The author noticed the terrain changing, �Flat road. Was replaced by short, rolling hills� (Joe kurmaskie). Being out in the middle of a dessert like surronding during June, and nothing surronding him is a scary thought. The heat, and lack of water affect him, by him possibly getting mirages, or he @MONTH1 faint, because of the heat, and how much fluid he has lost. The hills don�t help any eigther.	2	1		2																					
1717	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is riding through the desert in the middle of June yet he has very little water. This affects him because he is thirsty but he doesn�t have a lot of water to drink and he is in a desert in the middle of June which makes it very hot. Also in the story it says he comes to Welch�s Grape Juice Factory were on the side of the building he see picture of a �young boy pouring a refreshing a loss of juice into his mouth� This make the cyclist even thirstier but he continues one to find water at a bait shop.	1	1		1																					
1718	3	The cyclist in this essay is trying to go to Yosemite National Park. He feels confident in him making it, not realizing what is up ahead. First comes the windy roads. As he goes along his confidence starts to wither away. The desert hits him like a boulder because he is running short on water and needs to rest. The extreme heat just makes everything worse. �Not the miley into this heat section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. �This shows that the cyclist did not expect to meet this kind of terrain and is over whollmed by it. The one thing he never does is give up. This is important because as he went along, just before hagon up, he found a place to get water and to relax. �Then, as easily as running about, my troubles thirst, and nor were all behind me� This shows that he was strong and determined to survive and he finally found what he needed and it made happy and have a will to live. Everyone in life needs to be determined.	3	3		3																					
1719	3	It give him a hard time so he learn a lot of thing from that he know that it not always easy. It not abig problem but sometime some small problem become bigger life is like riding bike you have any down some time have problem sometimes lost but that is life.	0	0		0																					
1720	3	The features of the setting very much affect the cyclist. He had to ride through tough conditions and became very exhausted. I believe the toughest feature of the setting was the heat. He told us, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.�  He was talking about how he needed to sip from his water more than normally. Another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down. As he was riding he said, �Flat road was replace by short, rolling hills.� I believe riding over these hills in the hot @DATE1 in a California desert was a very tough task for the cyclist. I believe the terrain very much affected him.	2	3		3																					
1721	3	The features of the setting in this story make the ride more difficult for the cyclist. For example, the cyclist is moving through the �� high   deserts of California� �   (kurmaskie @NUM1). This shows that the cyclist is at a high altitude, which makes breathing more difficult. Then the cyclist notes that the �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills �   (Kurmaskie @NUM1   ). The hills would make the trip more difficult. This is evidenced by the cyclist describing one   of them as a   �� long, crippling hill� � (Kurmaskie @NUM1 ). Clearly, the terrain, which got   increasingly difficult, negatively affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1722	3	In the story, the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. For example, the condition of the road was bad. It changed from flat road to short, rolling roads. Tumble weeds crossed his path. He had lack of water, and the water he did have tasted like battery acid. In the story it says, �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.�  	2	2		2																					
1723	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist like if you have to goup hill or along long bumpy type roads. Then in the essay it says �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit: @CAPS1 does make things more difficult than average. Especially with a lack of water to make things worse.	1	1		1																					
1724	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist trying to get to Yosemite National Park. First of all, the cyclist says he�s in Lodi, California on a �gorgeous day in June.� It�s very hot in California in June, so the biker is affected by the weather because he could die of heatstroke. Also, he is in the middle of the desert , where he faces tumbleweeds crossing his path a large snake that are possible poisonous in the way. That puts him in more despair, because he could get hurt by a wild animal, or run out of water with no place to go get more ! So the setting mostly negatively affects the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1725	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist; the author says he is in the California desert. This means that the cyclist must conserve water so he can stay hydrated for the trip. Also, there are many hills, as the author says, �over one crippling hills�� with a lot of hills to climb, the cyclist uses up more energy and will become dehydrated quickly, if he isn�t careful. Finally, there are many abandoned towns that are several miles apart from each other. This again affects how the cyclists uses his water, he thinks that there is a prospering town coming up, so he drinks his water, thinking he�ll get more soon. However, when he gets there, there is no water, and he must pedal seveal more miles to the next town with very little water. The setting is a great effect on how the cyclists act especially with no water.	2	2		2																					
1726	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� greatly affect the cyclist. Depending on what sort of new terrain or landmark he came to,his determination increases and decreases. For example, when he saw a building come into view ahead of him, he got excited and used all his energy to get down the hill to the building. Also, when he came to the next building and found a working bathroom, he drank from the sink as his hope (of not dying) was renewed. The man riding the bike in the story had many different changes in his emotions during his long trek in this story that were dependent on the setting. 	2	3		3																					
1727	4	The author concludes the story with this because gardens cannot grow with snow on the ground. So she she figurers when all the snow is melted she�ll try to grow another one. I feel as if she wasn�t  happy enough to grow another garden I think she should be more interested in growin it then disappointed.    	0	0		0																					
1728	4	The narrater has that in with Paragraph becuse it all makes sence and it go'ss along together. The narrater says that when the guiss come out and the hibicus is budding is becuse it is ones more agian spring   	0	0		0																					
1729	4	The author concludes the story with that passage to show the importance of the inspiration Saeng gets from the hibiscus plant. Saeng, throughout the story was comforted by the hibiscus plant because it reminded her of home. The plant during the winter metaphorically explains: @CAPS1 attitude towards her new country and her driving test; the hibiscus plant in the winter is not as beautiful in the bitter cold, but it adapts and survives, and returns to its beautiful state in the spring. Saeng is bitter about her new country and driving test, but is adapting, and will be inspired by the beautiful state of the hibiscus in the spring to try her test again. In conclusion, the author ended the story in that way to stress importance in the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus plant.	3	2		3																					
1730	4	The author ended the story with this paragraph because it shows change. The snow is melting represents change from cold to warm. The geese returning represents a new life as in coming back to something semi�new. Just like the author is going back to drivers ed. The hibiscus is budding represents growth. The author will be older and more knolageble and more skilled than before.	1	2		2																					
1731	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph of, �Winter Hibiscus�, because it takes us back to things that happened in the story. Saeng failed the test before. In the spring the hibiscus will be budding again. Saeng realized that many of the things she thought were strange, were almost familiar to her now. The calls of the snow geese were almost familiar to her. The snow melting will tell her that it is now spring. Some of the things that might happen as a result of spring coming might be that @PERSON1 will past the test. Her mother will be proud of her. Also, Saeng will start to become a customed to her new country and her new surrounding and stopremenising about her life back in Vietnam.	2	2		2																					
1732	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author wanted to tell about about when saeng will take the test again. The author told the time with the season of the spring. In spring all the snows were melted and the geese and hibiscus has budding. And this paragraped make the reader to understand easyer. This is why the author include this paragraph in the story. 	1	1		1																					
1733	4	"The story ended with the author saying, ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is upset about spending @NUM1 on a plant that she had felt was different than the plant at home. She is stating that she is not going to take the test of buying one again until the geese return and the Hibiscus budds."	0	0		0																					
1734	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph helps bring to story to a closing. In the paragraph she is basically saying when the geese return and my flower is budding I'll be prepared enough to take the test. She'll be prepared because she'll be adapted enough and she'll have experienced enough just like the plant and the geese. She Is comparing her life to the lives of the geese and the life of her flower.	2	1		2																					
1735	4	The author would conclude the story with that paragraph because she failed the test before and she wants to pass it. It makes you wonder if she will pass it or not.	1	1		1																					
1736	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, it concludes the story with a good ending. In the story the girl buys a Hibiscus that remainds her of home. She goes home & tells her mother she failed her test but bought the plant. While she was planting it she seen geese and she was reminded of home. America was like home and she was happier. In the text she says, ""many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now."" She is willing to give the test another try and is sure to pass it. America is now starting to feel a little more like home. "	2	2		2																					
1737	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story started out by Saeng failing the test, going out and buying a plant to comfort her and confessing to her mom. The plant related to her by the memories of her homeland and when she failed that test she felt very depressed and sad. She cried to show her pain, and bought a plant to cheer her up. As she told her mom she felt the pain again but, her mother made her favorite food and helped her plant the plant. She knew that it wasn�t like the old plant but, it was the thought and memories she knew that she couldn�t just give up, so when it came the right time she was going to try the test again. It relates because it helps the readers understand the story a little better and shows that she wasn�t going to just quit. Her mother was very understanding and when she goes to retake the test she will be prepared. That is how it relates back to the story.	2	2		2																					
1738	4	I think he concluded the story with paragraph cause then do thing in the story and the report it so when the geese left they will come back and leave again so that what I think I take the test again means.	0	0		0																					
1739	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when every thing starts coming back she will take the test. That is why the author concludes the story with this parigraph	1	1		1																					
1740	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show a sense of determination that Saeng posesses. When Saeng comes back and shows her mother the hibiscus plant, she is very upset, with tears in her eyes.Her mother at first is disappointed in her for buying the plant, but is then understanding when she realizes that Saeng was distraught. The mother offers to help Saeng plant the hibiscus, which comforts Saeng a little bit, helping her gain the determination she needs to recover. The story says �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This quote states that Saeng realizes that things at home can be the same as things in her new country. The author uses the term �familiar� to express that Saeng is starting to accept the fact that some things @MONTH1 be different, but she will eventually get used to it, making her view on life more positive.  	2	2		2																					
1741	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because in the paragraph there is a lot said that is the main part of this story. For example all the names and talks about the seasons and there comparisions and differences and it talks abouts different buddings like when you get your mids your nuggets and headies of the plant. Because hibiscus is a new form of some nice @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
1742	4	He states this as the conclusion because it shows the faith that she has in the flower and how it will bring her luck for her up coming test. She feels like the familiar flower is out of place as she is and they can relate to somethings.	1	1		1																					
1743	4	I believe the author concludes the story with Saeng because it shows when she is reminded of home. I believe she thought she could pass the test when the flower was blooming and reminded her of home. For example, Saeng mumbled, �Not like the kind we had before.� This suggest to me that she was probably home sick. Then when spring comes and it blooms the flower could give her the strength to pass the test. This is why I believe the author ended with this paragraph.	2	1		2																					
1744	4	The arthur uses it because Saeng got confidence back from planting the hibiscus and everything that happened that year. So now shes ready and that�s what the arthur wanted the reader to figure out.	1	1		1																					
1745	4	"the author concludes the story this way because Saeng failed the test, the hibiscus comforts her, and she feels she is similar to the geese. For example, Saeng says �I-I failed the test.� She has admitted to failing the test and is upset about it and wants to �take that test again."" @CAPS1, Saeng says,"" And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar, too, �while describing the hibiscus. The familiarity of the plant comforts her and will allow her to build up the courage to �take the test again.� Finally, at one point Saeng thinks to herself, ""the quiet repetition of season opon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.� Saeng feels similar to the geese in this way and this allows her to decide to take the test � when the snow melts and the geese return.� The author concludes the story strongly, describing how Saeng failed the test, how the hibiscus comforts her and she feels similar to the geese."	2	3		3																					
1746	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph because she will be reminded of her homeland and going home. The reason I say that is because the geese are returning home and she wants to. Also the hibiscus will be budding in the wild just like back home	1	1		1																					
1747	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph by teaching Saeng how to be confident and vow silently, In order to teach her more lessons because of the fact she failed the test in the middle of the passage Saeng tells her mother that when the snow is gone in the spring time she will retake the test that she failed. Her mother was very upset when she found out that Saeng failed the test the first time.	1	1		1																					
1748	4	They probably ended it like that to build suspense of leave the reader on a good note because someone @MONTH1 think things are going to get better for them and Saeng @MONTH1 get her license. They @MONTH1 get more money.	1	1		1																					
1749	4	 In� Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the main character, saeng , undergos many obstacles as she tries to adapt to her new country , which is very different from her home. The author chooses to end the story, as,� When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 the author meant to end the story in this fashion to ensure the reader that saeng has found new hope , which symbolized by the hibiscus flower.Now along with  budding  new hope, the flower also carries a sentimental value ,about her home .Sometimes ,the best way to overcome your obstacles is to embrace them, as she did in the greenhouse ,then   that leaves room to start anew.	2	3		3																					
1750	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to snow that just because you fail once you  shouldn�t give up.  From  what  was  expressed  it  the  paragraph it  was  implied to me that Saeng  will become  stronger by spring and be able to pass the test .	1	1		1																					
1751	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because all things have routins and things they have to do to survive. The geese fly @CAPS1 for the warm months so they don�t die from the cold. The flower dies in the winter is brought back to life in the spring. This pertains to Saeng because when the geese and the flowr come back she will take the test of trying to fit in, in her new country, That is why the auther chose this to end the story.	2	1		2																					
1752	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, the author ends with the last specified paragraph, �When they came back�then I will take that test again.� because it leaves many un-answered questions the reader might have. The reader then might want to read her next piece of work. Basically, the last paragraph drows attention to the reader. many of the unanswered questions revolve around, �I failed the test.�. We also do not know �her gentle grandmother�, �mrs.Lambert�, and �home�. Another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have a effect on the reader. The reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What will happen? All we know is, �when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader. This is why, I believe the author of �Winter Hibiscus� ended with the specified paragraph.	1	2		2																					
1753	4	I think that she ended the story like that because it means that she is getting used to all the seasons. �In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hisbiiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� She will and take the test once its not cold anymore so she will wait until the geese come again which will be spring by then. I think that she is also trying to say that when the snow melts and the geese are there again she will have taken the test and pass it. This is I think she ended it like this because how they mean something to her.	1	1		1																					
1754	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how everything is changing and adapting to the change. Saeng decides that with this change, she can also adapt to her new life by going back and passing the drivers test. The hibiscus also represents how something also from her homeland has come to america and must now survive. When it begins to bud, Saeng will begin to start adapting to america by passing her drivers test. It�s all about trying to become accustomed to changes. When Saeng feels bad for failing, that�s why something from her past is such a comfort to her.	2	2		2																					
1755	4	By ending the story with the idea of retaking a test in the spring, the author sets a feeling of starting fresh and perservering . for example , when the author says� when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding ,�she show the idea of starting a fresh new life in the spring by returning to their home and the hibiscus is starting fresh by  budding again. This is why spring is when saeng wants to start fresh and retake the test. The paragraph also shows that saeng, like the hibiscus, is perservering. The hibiscus is perservering by making it through the winter and blooming again while saeng   is perservering by retaking the test. The author ends with this paragraph to show that saeng is not going to give up. 	3	3		3																					
1756	4	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph because Saeng feels most comfortable taking the test again when what she explained happens. Saeng misses where she came from alot. She promised herself that she would take the test again when that happens. With Saeng saying that it makes you wonder why she wont take the test again the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. It makes her feel really comfortable when that does happen.	1	1		1																					
1757	4	The concluding paragraph explains her next goal. She had to take a test but failed it. Paid over nineteen dollars for the plant. It reminded her of her old home. She will have confident in the spring because the plant grew to its new home so she will grow to her new home also.	2	2		2																					
1758	4	The author concludes the story with his par paragraph because. She will take the test in the spring and she will do her best. She said �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. By failing a test. doesn�t mean. that its not end of everthing. She will have more confidence next time she take the test.	1	1		1																					
1759	4	The author concludes the story, �winter hibiscus,� with this paragraph of the story, for several relevant reasons. By concluding the story, in this way it shows Saeng�s growth, and more willingness to strive, and do her best. When she says she will take the test again, it shows her gain of confidence, and her beginning to gain comfort in the place that is not her home country. She is now striving and working toward doing her best to become successful. And she is making the very best of the given situation. The author is trying to give more depth and meaning to the study in this way. Saeng went from being nervous and worried when saying, �I-I failed the test,� to now setting a goal for herself to take it again, the time the bud blooms next year. Basically, the author did a full circle, by ending the story in this way. From speaking of the test, to sharing the flower experience with her mother, to state that she will re-take the test, next year. 	3	2		3																					
1760	4	The auther concludes with that paragraph because. it shows that despite her sorrow and discomfort, Saeng is able to remain hopeful. In the story, Saeng sees a hibiscus which makes her very homesick for her native country of Vietnam. The reader also leans that she failed a test and feels at of place. However, the hibiscus symbolizes hope and comfort. The auther chooses to conclude with that paragraph because despite Saeng�s hardships, the hibiscus helps her realize that she can overcome he obstacles and be hopeful of the future.	2	2		2																					
1761	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when saeng and her mother go back to there home where the flowers were more beautiful than the flowers where there living now. She wants to plant flowers that�s going to remind her of her home. In the story saeng mother said that it�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here this winter hibiscus her mother wanted her to know that the only thing that maths is that the plant can last threw winter.	1	1		1																					
1762	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wanted to show just cause saeng failed that test don�t mean she giving up. she said when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take it again. what the author means that right now she has failed but over time she can study and learn more to get ready to re take it. And by the time she ready to take the test the snow with have went away every should be hot out the birds come back and the flower is growing fine. she  will take it. And how author ended it lets us know she going to take it but how he use the words let us know that she will not only take it but pass it too.	2	1		2																					
1763	4	The author concludes the story with that because the hibiscus started budding and she�s happy now. So she�s saying after the geese come back and the snow melt, she�s to do all over again.	0	0		0																					
1764	4	The reason the author of the story �Winter hibiscus� ends it the way she does is so that we know we can never give up. She fails her driving test the first time and me being less than a year from taking the test myself and no matter how many time I fail the test I will never give up. We need to preserve through every problem we go through in life. If we don�t and we just give up we will never get anything done in life. She vows in the spring and when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. I hope I pass my driving test the first time just like I did the learner�s permit test. Also you can�t give up on anything at all even something small like working if you stop working you will loose your job. Never give up.	1	2		2																					
1765	4	the author added that sentence to the story to show how much Saeng cared about the snow and the plants. She says that she much rather do gardening then school work. She loves planting new things.	0	0		0																					
1766	4	The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the � winter hibiscus�. Then later in the story she says how ,�many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .� That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,�then she will take that test again.�therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.  	3	2		3																					
1767	4	The writer leaves the reader with a sense of hope for the future by concluding with this paragraph. Even though the narrator buys the plant in sadness, after she fails her driving test and is missing her home, it is still a symbol of hope. She means that when the flower is blooming, her hope will be also and she will try again, maybe this time with success. Right now she @MONTH1 be sad and scary, but she knows that things will work out, and she will be fine. She is finally settling into her new life and says that �many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.� She means that even though she misses her homeland so much, she is slowly getting used to her new home, and her new life. And maybe by the spring she will be happy and comfortable here, comfortable enough to try her driving test again. The hibiscus represents both the longing for the past and the hope for the future.	3	2		3																					
1768	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is most comfortable when she is surrounded by things from her homeland. She thinks she will be ready to take the test when she sees the ducks again, and when the hibiscus begins to bud. Narrator says ��A saebya ledges tall and high, had surrounded their garden��� @CAPS2 is evidence that Saeng had hibiscus in Vietnam, and the story of the well reminds her of it. The narrator also says,�� Overhead, a flock of @CAPS1 geese, their faint looks clear and -yes-familiar to Saeng now,�� @CAPS2 proves that the geese symbolize @CAPS3 home also.     	2	2		2																					
1769	4	I belive the author concludes with that quote for an assortment of reasons. One is to show that the charecter isn�t just going to give up, that her failing wasn�t the end for her. This shows sorting like morale of never giving up. It feels as the character is referring to the hibiscus as sensely. �The hibiscus will be budding�   which means that she herself will branch out and learn more. By the spring time she would have learned enough and experienced enough to try to pass the test again. The hibiscus also reminds her of her home. When she will look at it she will find the courage to pull through and to face her challenges like her test.The ending quotealso wraps up the story.It also shows the charecters will of not giving up and to always try.	2	2		2																					
1770	4	"The author uses this concluding paragraph to draw the whole story together. She speaks of the driving test, geese, and the hibiscus plant three subjects found in the story. when she says ""when the snow melts and the geese return"", she is referring to the geese mentioned when she says ""She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky"". She went through a change, much like the geese do every winter. She realizes ""that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befere had become...familiar to her now"". We all have to go through changes, Saeng just had a bigger one. "	1	2		2																					
1771	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author wrote the same thing that it had in the paragraph and he wrote it in his story but added a little more details to it and problems and things.	0	0		0																					
1772	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng is respectful and how her feelings miss her homeland. First example when �Saeng vowed silently to herself� it shows how she respect and miss her homeland. It tells that she want to try again about her failure in the past. The last example when she want to overcome her failure in the past. The last line of the paragraph say �then I will take that test again�. It says she want another. Chance on her life. These are the example of the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
1773	4	"The author had concluded this story with this paragraph to make it as if they were on a clean slate like they had started over. So the past no longer haunts them. Saeng sounds as if she has a bit of relief after she takes her mom the plate. I believe that she feels better because at the end of the paragraph she sounds sure of herself. She sounds certain she sounds as if she want to start over because she says ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. To me she sounds like a brand new person. Who has forgotten about the past."	1	2		2																					
1774	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the plant is noticed when she is coming home after felling the driving test. So she says when everything is right. She will take the test again. The driving test not important to her she won�t pas it though so she wants to go take it again when the plant she bought is budding and at its best point.	1	1		1																					
1775	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng�s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about.	3	2		3																					
1776	4	The author used the last paragraph because the hibiscus is a symbol for saeng. It shows that she will be ready when spring comes. When the plant is ready to bud, she will have faith about taking the test. She'll probably want to take care of the plant before she takes the test. When the plant bads, saeng won�t have to take care of it anymore.	1	1		1																					
1777	4	"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because Saeng is saying when the good time came back around she will try for the test again because She had failed it. for example on page @NUM1 at the top She "" I-I falled the test"" thats why i think the author concludes this with the Story because it was important to Saeng to past the test in the good time of season Spring. "	1	1		1																					
1778	4	�Winter Hibiscus �is about a girl saeng, who moved from Vietnam to the @ORGANIZATION1. After she fails her driver�s test. She walks home and finds a hibiscus. �She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long gray hair�� She goes to a flower shop to see if it can be purchased. She pays a lot of money for the plant because it is rare and valuable. It is special to her because she used to have hibiscus plants in Vietnam. She brings the plant home & tells her mom that it reminds her of Vietnam. The mom says that it reminds her of Vietnam too. The mom is not happy with how much saeng paid for it. She plants it in her garden.� When the hibiscus was lowered in the ground, a flock of geese flew by.�When the hibiscus returns in the spring,  saeng will take her driver�s test again. In the spring, all the flowers start to bud and bloom. Everything is new again. saeng will have a new chance to pass her test.	2	2		2																					
1779	4	I think that the included that because she is compareing her slef as a flower. When she grows again like a flower she will go prove to past that test. She�s saying there always a second chance. She want to tell everyone that it�s to miss or a misake. For an example �they said there were many of things that she had thought of strangely, season up seson.	2	1		2																					
1780	4	"The author concludes the story like that because she wants every body to know how she feels about the hibiscus. She felt like the hibiscus was a wondeful plant. She described it as ""smooth and cool toward the end of the first page. When she first the plant back in Vietnam she thought that is just grew wildly. Then when she saw it in the United States she was suprised that it grew in a pot. For example she desribed the the smell of the hibiscus as a ""sweet scent.� @CAPS1, this why she is concluded the story like this; because of how felt about the plant."	0	0		0																					
1781	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows Saeng passion for gardening. How she�s willing to take the test is to see if her plants can grow when spring comes around and the hibiscus starts to bud she will attempt to grow it which shows how anxious Saeng is for gardening and to try and get the hibiscus to grow during the spring.	0	0		0																					
1782	4	The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.	1	1		1																					
1783	4	Change and disappointment are enough to over-come. Some people have an arid fear of change. For Saeng the main character from �winter Hibiscus,� change comes in the form of a move to @LOCATION1. Everything around her is different and new. Coupled with disappointment of failing her driver's exam, the feeling of living helpless overwhelms her. After buying a winter hibiscus plant, she vows to take the test again when it blooms in the spring. The resiliance of the winter flower and the memories it represents inspire seng to try again.	2	3		3																					
1784	4	I think the author wanted to express Saeng when she took a vowed and to express the way he felt. When the statement was made that also I think it was to make readers feel interest in it but mainly to help understand.	0	0		0																					
1785	4	For shadowing, future reference, continus behavoir-all are reasons why that is the last paragraph. Well they are for shadowing because they are telling you something that she says she is going to do in the future. She is telling you what she plants to do in the future so she refrencing from what she plans to do in the future she is keeping the behavior from before up so she says she will something again next year so that is why I said continus behavior. She said ��when they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this  hibiscus is buddin, then I will take that test again. So For shadowing, future, reference, continus behaviors are very good reasons why I thing that what she says is good and those three things best describe what she said and what she said that snow as going to do next year.     	1	2		2																					
1786	4	I believe that the author concludes the story like this to show a sense of continuation in life. In the story Saeng takes a �test� and fails. She goes out and buys a hibiscus plant for well over what she what she should have paid for it. Her test is to try to get over the memories of her real �home� that Saeng is now only cries about when she thinks of it. To Saeng the plant represents memories and a life that she once had, but no longer does, however does want it back. Her vowe to herself is that when the geese come flying back over her that she will go back to the greenhouse that reminds her so much of her home and try once again to say �home� without breaking down, and without having something extremely expensive.	2	2		2																					
1787	4	In 'Winter hibiscus' by @CAPS1 Ho, the narrator never clearly indicates what test Saeng has failed. However, through subject matter and word choice it is clear that the test is not only important to Saeng and her mother, but also to her new life in @LOCATION1. Throughout the story saeng's longing for her homeland is over powering. The flood of memories that came back to her when she purchases the hibiscus, are obviously painful and part of her everyday life. Saeng is working is working hard to keep her memories of Vietnam alive, while knowing that she must learn to live the @CAPS2 customs and lifestyle. There are somethings she dosent need to change, like passing the test. Saeng realizes that she can use these memories to keep her spirits alive, she can use them as motivation. This is why the last sentance of the story is so impowering, because she has learned to use the @NUM1 things together memory and change, �when [] this hibiscus is budding I will take that test again�     	3	2		3																					
1788	4	"The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to show that the girl had adapted to her new country. Saeng missed her home. It was hard for her to say her country�s home without crying. ""It�s not like the wind we had at-at-."" She also spent @MONEY1 on a plant because it remind her of back at home. One could inter she adapted because she was familiar with the season change and it states when the geese return she is going to take the test again."	1	2		2																					
1789	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes Saeng feel more at home. For example it say, �the snow melt, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. �I think the author says this because all the thing in that sentence remind her of home. For example the plant the geese are things she had at home, so when winter is over she will feel better and take the test.  	1	1		1																					
1790	4	The reason why the author ended with Saeng vowed iS because she is very commited. She failed the first time but know she really want to pass it so she is waiting until the snow melt and @CAPS1 geese return and this hibiscus is buddin @CAPS2 she will come back	1	1		1																					
1791	4	I think that the author concluded the story like that because of who throw out the whole Story the plot was in the winter. She might wanted to try it in a different season to see if she might to better with the whot setvation. That is why I think the author concluded the story like that.  	0	0		0																					
1792	4	I think the author finish the story with this paragraph for the following reasons. Saeng really means she will take the test in spring. I say that because she says when the snow melt and geese return meaning next spring she will take the test again. She is saying with confidence because she started to add more. For example, she added �hibiscus is budding.� Saeng is determined to past the test just by what she is saying. This is why it was the last paragraph and what she meant by it.	1	1		1																					
1793	4	The author concludes the story with in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is  budding then I will take that test again, because she is saying there will be a new year. For example he failed it the first time she will wait until she tries again. Another example she just want to try until she get her driving license.	1	1		1																					
1794	4	In this story Saeng shows her mother how pasionate she is with planting and her pasionate for plants. The author includes the paragraph in the story so that it can show how the charact Saeng feels about her planting. One reason why this shows that she has passion for planting is because it says �I will try this test again� meaning that if she is doing something that she enjoys doing then she will try it again and again until she is fully pleased.	0	0		0																					
1795	4	The authors concludes that in the paragraph. I think he concluded that in these because it shows alot of confidence about her. For example when she said, �then I will take that test again�. It sounded very confident and made it where she can want to try if she or he fails the first time.	2	3		3																					
1796	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she has not given up on her dreams.	1	1		1																					
1797	4	Hope, a new beginning, adjustment-all are reasons why the speaker concludes by saying �when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� That hibiscus flower gives that girl hope because it remind her of her grandmother and back home, how wonderful things were back there, and by the flower blooming, she realize it could wear out there too. She�ll also have a new beging in the spring, by spring she should adjust to her surrounding and have new friends, things to do, and new memories to look back on, that looking backabout flawall won't be as bad the flower will bring her hope and comfort with her adjustment.	2	2		2																					
1798	4	The author is saying that she�s not doing nothing intell it is a nice day outside. Also she want it to be not that cold but not that not for she can come out and play with her children. Then she said she will take her test again for a nice day outside for her.	1	1		1																					
1799	4	The author ends the story with this conclusion to show that @PERSON1 is very passionate about connecting her life in the United States, to how life was in Vietnam and bringing them together somehow. In the story, @PERSON1 talks about how she misses home and how she is still trying to adapt to her new life away from the home she knew, when saeng says that she has failed the test and wants to take it again, she means that she wants to show that she can survive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When saeng spent @MONEY1 on a plant, her mom was in disbelief because Saeng knows how hard it is to survive. When the conclusion says,�I will take the test again,� it shows that Saeng is willing try to make it in the United States from Vietnam, proving that she can make a better life for herself and her family by working hard. While still keeping trditions in Vietnam alive. Saeng simply wanted to make her new home feel like Vietnam by buying a plant she knew her mother would like.	2	2		2																					
1800	4	The author might have concluded this story because it like a downfall. Which mean like right now he�s at the bottom and got to make it to the top. He is going to start over and take the test again, but thes time he is not going to fail.	1	1		1																					
1801	4	"The author had concluded her paragraph like this for emotion. This last paragraph gives emotion to know she can�t garden do to winter. In the winter time all of her plants die for the season. 'The, author is just saying saeng is coming back. After the snow, frosts and cold weather is gone Saeng will come next season so she can continue with her gardening, plants and soil. As said �I will take the test again"" saeng.  Meaning saeng will come back and take the test of effort with her gardening and her mother next time/ next season when her starts to grow again."	1	1		1																					
1802	4	I think that the author concludes which paragraph as his ending because thats what that is what the girl is going to be doing for the following year that is going to pass and still be with her mother helping her out in the garden. Without no friends just let in her mom	1	1		1																					
1803	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng has found from hibiscus plant. Like the  plant Saeng is going to overcome an obstacle. She will try the driving test again and the plant will overcome. The harsh   ,blutal winter months. The plant will bloom in the spring and show its restrency during adversity. Saeng   will also overcome the  adversity  she faced when failed her driving test and realizing how much she missed her homeland. Saeng too, in a sense will bloom in the spring. The winter, representing her despise  and homesickness, will not present her from living happly and taking the test over.The hibiscus reminds her of the. The story ends with the paragraph to show how the � Winter Hibiscus� has taught her something about overcoming obstacles.	3	2		3																					
1804	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is going to accept her new home and reconize the similarities from her old home and hold memories close to help her overcome obstacles that she is facing in life. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. It's flowers arn't as pretty, but it`s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.� This sets similarities from their old home to their new home. This shows that things do change but they are also the same. This leads to the conclusion because this is where Saeng relizes that she will always have the memories of her old home and will use them to help her overcome the troubles shes going through.  "	2	2		2																					
1805	4	The author ends the story the way she did to show how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are a like and how Saeng will overcome her obstacle when the plant overcomes its obstacle. Saeng�s obstacle is adjusting to her new life and the first step in that is passing her driver�s test. The reader knows she has to pass because Saeng tells her mother , �I-I failed the @NUM1]. The hibiscus must make it through the winter, it also has to adjust to new surrounding to survive, just like Saeng. The mother says to Saeng,�� but its strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus.Thats what matter �[@NUM2]. So,if the winter hibiscus� job, or hurdle that it has to jump,it to make it, to stay alive during the winter months, then its job will be done in the spring. The author ends the story with Saeng telling herself, �� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�[@NUM2]. If Saeng�s obstacle is completing, and passing the driver�s test, and she passes in the spring, right as the hibiscus passes it�s �test� , the symbolism between the two, showing a determined spirits to adopt, will grow deeper because that will adopt and pass their obstacle at the same time.	3	3		3																					
1806	4	I think that the story came back to this because that is what the story starts off with. It all started with Saeng going to take a test but she did not pass it. So when the weather is better she would have a batter time trying to pass that test. This is way I think she came back that the test.	1	1		1																					
1807	4	The reason why the author concludes the story this way is because she wanted to leave the reader in suspence : wanting more. You can tell because it never really says what the test is. She wanted you to try and guess what the test is. When Saeng walked up to her mother she had told her that she failed the test.	1	1		1																					
1808	4	"The author ends the story with that paragraph, to give an unsight on the next story. I think there will be another story because there are clue to support my theory. Just at the beginning of the paragraph at just when they come back. Then at the end at stay ""then I will take the test again. I dint stay happily ever after at anything similar its that at just stated those personally changes mentioned. So I think what the author will write another story so we could see if Saeng will pass her test.   "	1	1		1																					
1809	4	The author ended with this paragraph because it is an example of how everything gets a fresh start in the spring. an example of this is that the geese will return home after the winter to start a new family and also in the winter the hibiscus leaves will die and then in the spring they will have a new start, I think the author uses this paragraph last because it�s a metaphor of how everything will get a fresh start and also Saeng will get a new chance to take her driving test just like the plant and geese will get a new chance at life.	2	2		2																					
1810	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because these geese coming back symbolize Saeng�s determination and hope that she needs to pass the driving test. She will wait for the winter to pass so that she can pass the test. The coming of spring also symbolizes renewal and birth. Saeng will have the chance again to pass the driving test with renewed faith and encouragement. This is a great way to end the story because it is really deep and makes the reader think about the meaning of the scene and how the geese, hibiscus plant, and spring arriving effect the conclusion of the story.	3	2		3																					
1811	4	I think the author concludes the story with that ParagraPh to say that he will @CAPS1 uP in sPring time when the snow melts and geese return. Also I think that the author like the setting of sPring also to see the sunny skies a geese floating in a @CAPS2. I also would like that setting because It gives me more ideas and it's a very lovely setting to be around. That is why I think the author Picked that ParagraPh to conclude the story.	0	0		0																					
1812	4	"The short story, Winter Hibiscus, is a about a girl who moved with her mother to @LOCATION1. The story tells about the girls transition into the different culture. During the story, the author makes references to the daughter having to pass a test. At the end of the story the author wrote �In the spring�then I will take that test again.� In the text, the girl says �it�s-it�s not a real one,� when referring to the winter hibiscus plant she bought. The reader could infer that this quote means that the girl has memories of home, but they are not the real thing. Also the author wrote �� much preferred it to the Big Mac"". This quote shows that she misses her own culture & cannot adapt to the @CAPS1 one that she lives in now. In conclusion, the girls test @MONTH1 be that she needs to be able to handle change & also be able to recall memories of her homeland with happiness instead of sadness."	2	3		3																					
1813	4	The author concludes the story with that ending because he wanted to show the reader �if you just try, you might like it,� and that�s why the girl said she would come back next spring when the snows melt so she can take the test again.	0	0		0																					
1814	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has everything together. One way it ties everything together is by taking what had happen in the beginning and tieing it in with why she had bought the flower in the first place. Also it ties Saeng's old memories from Vietnam to her new way of life in the United States. The story states ""carefully Saeng dicked it up and smilled. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. the familiar programe filled her lungs."" this is now the flower she found in the flower shop gave her memories from Vietnam. this is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1815	4	The author  concludes  the  story  with  that  paragraph because its telling / showing  us  that  Saeng  is  going   to  try to pass  the  test  in the spring  . Getting  that  hibiscus  reminded  her  of  her   homeland  and  it  gave  her  memories of  then . And  it also made her believe  in herself and want to get there and  try  again . If made her  hopeful . The author  test in � when snow melts  and  the  geese  return  and this hibiscus is budding � to help indicate  that  its going  to  be  spring  when  she  trys  to take  her test  again.	2	2		2																					
1816	4	The author concludes the story with this pharagraph because he figures after all that has happened like she failed the test he wanted to end to be remembered is a happy thing. Also wanted the end to show how something bad happened but  next she was going to do it again. The author wanted to show that she wouldn�t give up, she goes after what she wants. And he wanted that to be the last pharagraph.	1	1		1																					
1817	4	The author concludes the story the way that they did to signify that the girl will not give up trying to pass her test and will adapt to her new found home and make it what her home in Vietnam was to her. The girl is remeniscent of her past life and wishes to go back and have the life she had in her home country. When she is  	1	1		1																					
1818	4	"The Author chose to conclude the story with this paragraph because it is resolutive to the entire reading before it. In the story Saeng (the girl) had been stressed from failing the @CAPS1 test. She was also saddened by the memory of the hibiscus plant back in her native country Vietnam. At the end of the story when it says �when the snow melts and the geese return, and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again"" ,(Ho) the snow melting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding symbolize change and adoption. Saeng will need to change and adapt to a new life to pass the test and feel better. This is why the Author @CAPS2 Ho, of the story �Winter Hibiscus� used a strong, symbolistic and resolutive end to her story."	3	2		3																					
1819	4	After Saeng fails her driver�s test, she gives up hope for the future. The sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up, no matter how tough the situation. In the story, Saeng�s mother says, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matters.� This quote shows how even though its not an object of beauty, it can do what it takes to survive. Saeng feels that she is also like the hibiscus, having the strength to be able to survive in a new environment. Even though she is new to this country, Saeng had proved that no matter how big the situation, anything can be overcomed if you believe in yourself and your family.	2	3		3																					
1820	4	The author probably used this as the last paragraph to show that at this time next year she is going to take the again. The author writes this paragraph to show that she failed the test when the geese were going away for winter and the hibiscus was blooming.	1	1		1																					
1821	4	The author concludes the end; of the story the way he/she did because it shows how much the plant truly means. S'aeng is going to wait till the flower blooms because it means so much to her. The flower represents her and her driving test. When the hibiscus is ready to bloom, she will be ready to drive. The plant gives her hope for a new tommorow, a new chance. The last paragraph helps the reader realize how much the plant means to the girl, its significance. It makes her feel more at home, and her home makes her feel stranger; makes her joyful and happy after the misery of failing the driving test.	2	2		2																					
1822	4	She concludes with this the story this paragraph because she wants @DATE1 to come again. She says �when the snow melts�. She wants to look at the events again. and take care of them.	0	0		0																					
1823	4	In this short story, Saeng vows to take the test again in the spring because she knows that she will be able to pass it once she has accepted living in this new place. After Saeng moved, she was very upset and missed her old home, family, and lifestyle. This prevented her from focusing on the test. However, once she realized that the flowers are beatiful in her new home too, she began to accept the changes. The geese being familiar to her symbolizes that she is adjusting to her new lifestyle. Saeng also probably made this vow because she didn�t want her mother to be disappointed in her again. After seeing her mother's disappointment and loving kindness, Saeng was determined to pass the test. When Saeng takes the test again in the spring, she will be ready because she has adjusted to and accepted her new life.	3	2		3																					
1824	4	The authoR concludes thEy stoRy with thE paRagraph bEcause in thE bEing oF the stoRy heR Family movEd to thE United States from Vietnam. Saeng was walking home FRom Failing heR dRivER's test.

1825	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng can overcome obsticles, & the next time she has these reminders she will succeed. When she says �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before had become... almost farmllular to her now� & this is saying she is getting used to the chages in her new life. So the end paragraph reflects these ideas.	1	1		1																					
1826	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with the paragraph for a few reasons. One reason is that she is trying to overcome change and wants to make the situation better. She trys doing that by taking the test again. The author also concludes with the paragraph because she feels heartbroken that life is not going her way and that she needs to do something about it. Thats why the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show you if she is determined or not. If she will stick through it or not.	2	2		2																					
1827	4	I think that the author concluded the story with that paragraph because she is going to see if she can adapt to the new country. This is a good way to leave off the story because you don�t know if she will or not; it leaves you on a cliff hanger. I also tink this is a good way to leave it off because he could write a sequal to it and make a series out of it.	1	1		1																					
1828	4	The author concludes this with the story because the snow is pretty and geese are animals that make it pretty so they want you to think that our outdoors is the nices thing around.	0	0		0																					
1829	4	 The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story  ��Winter Hibiscus�� with that paragraph to show Saeng  starting over��� In the spring , When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding� connects to her  life, is that she is starting fresh in away. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, she is making on effort, and ��take that test again��� By retailing the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to ��@CAPS1 of loss.�� and to her grief.      	2	2		2																					
1830	4	The author concluds the story with this paragraph because he knows all of this stuff going on will probley def come back up again. Just like how he said the geese, will geese  come back every year, so he is def saying that off of this will com back up. That is what I think.	1	1		1																					
1831	4	I think that the author made that the concluding sentence because it means that when Saeng is ready then she will take the test again. I think that she is comparing herself to the snow, the snow the geese, and the hibiscus. I think so because she says that when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. So I think that she is saying that she is not ready for the test and when she does get ready then that is when she will take it.	2	1		2																					
1832	4	The author's conclusion to the story shows how Saeng interpreted the experience of that day. She uses a spring time setting to show when her confidence in herself is reborn. Seeing her hibiscus bud in the spring will giver herself and newfound integrity to go try that driving test again.	1	2		2																					
1833	4	Hope, positivness, helpful all are reasons the author concludes the story with this paragraph. First, the last paragraph gives the readers a sense that Saeng has hope. I felt that she had hope because she is willing to take the test again. Since she is going to take the test again she wants to  help her mother. Second, the last paragraph gave me the feeling that Saeng has a positive attitude. She bought a flower to replace the dead ones, and she stated that she will re-take the test in the spring. Third, Saeng is helpful to her mother. Saeng finished digging the hole for the new flower for her mother, so her mom could go make dinner. Saeng also saw the feeling her mom felt when she found out Saeng did not pass the test. So she is re-taking the test. Saeng was feeling just about what any other new kid probably would have felt. She was scared, but through everything Saeng had hope, a positive attitude, and she was helpful.	2	2		2																					
1834	4	To her the hibiscus was a test. Saeng felt she failed the test of letting go of the past and embracing �now.� The hibiscus reminded her of home, so she spent over @MONEY1 on it, knowing she and her mother needed the money. Essentaily, she felt as though she failed a test.	1	1		1																					
1835	4	I think the author concludes the story with that parography because they want you to understand Saeng's strength. One reason I think they also end the story like that because she know inside that when her plant is strong and not covered in snow that she will be strong so that's when she wont`s to take her driving test. For example when she said, �When the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
1836	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the main character Saeng and her mother, moved from their homeland to this new place, where everything was different. she was having a very hard time adapting to this new place, and Saeng failed an importian test. She had been very discouraged by this, and she was trying to remind herself of being at home. She bought the winter Hibiscus to remind her of home, but when she was planting it she became very determined to try and adapt, by taking the test, when the hibiscus would bud. The author is concluding by there being hope, and determination for Saeng to adapt to her new home.	2	2		2																					
1837	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it adds the uplifting message that Saeng will be able to overcome the obstacles of living in an unfamiliar country. First; the @CAPS1 geese represent a piece of her new home because she reasons �reluctantly� that they are familiar to her now, This depicts her ability to adapt to her new environment. In addition, she also equates spring to when the habiscus is budding and the habiscus is a symbol of herself because both are trying to live in a country that is not their own. Therefore, the habiscus budding represents her being able to live comfortably in @LOCATION1. Finally, she vows that she will take her drivers test again. Her intial failure to pass the test showed her inability to become a part of @LOCATION1, but if she passes it. Then she will have successfully adapted. Overall, the author of this stoy concludes with this paragraph because it contains the theme of the passage through an uplifting message.  	3	2		3																					
1838	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong ho, the ending includes the hibiscus budding and retaking the test to make a connection between the two. The geese are also included in the end to show the new country she has adapted to because she recognizes when the geese come and go. The budding of the hibiscus is to her much more than just a flower. It shows the rejuvenation of new life within her just as flowers tend to bud in the spring. That is also why she chooses to take the test because her �budding� will occur in the spring, and she will have newly born confidence for the upcoming test. That is why the geese, hibiscus, and the test are all included in the end of the story to show the connection between her past home and adaptation to a new lifestyle.	3	2		3																					
1839	4	She will try gardning again after the geese and flowers return. She wants to have the best garden around. She wants to keep the tradition going.	0	0		0																					
1840	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause. Saeng didn�t think the winter hibiscus was In the ground now and that when she got back all of her plants was gone do to the snow so she said she will take that test again meaning she will start back to the first steps of her plants and flowers.	0	0		0																					
1841	4	"The author concludes, ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng doesn't want to give up yet. In the story Saeng mumbled, ""I mean, not like the kind at-at- ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. ""Saeng was still upset because she misses her home in Vietnam. When Saeng puts the hibiscus in the ground she feels more alive and Saeng wants to feel at home in the United States. Saeng isn't going to give up driving but to try, harder and harder to pass the test."	1	2		2																					
1842	4	The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it�s related to she thinks, when her semile of welcome warmed Saeng �cheep skip over live to you�re back she saw cheerfully� @CAPS1 it�s past time what took you so long? now did it go? Did you? She feels very skip over its related to	0	0		0																					
1843	4	�When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The story �winter hibiscus� ended with this paragraph because it will be a fresh start for Saeng. It will be spring out and the geese will come back to her home where she lives now, which now has the hibiscus to remind her of her old home. The paragraph also compares Saeng to the hibiscus. In the story her mother says, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it is strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matters.� Saeng is the winter hibiscus that�s strang enough to make it through winter and failing the test won�t matter until spring when she will take it and pass. That�s represented when the hibiscus is in bloom. I also think the story ended this way because it ties in Saeng�s feelings throughout the story of her new home and old home. It�s also showing her ability to conquer obstacles. She is going to forget about failing the driving test and work to pass it in the spring.	3	3		3																					
1844	4	I think the author concludes the story with that Paragraph because the hibiscus makes them over come obstacles. She wanted to take the test again so she can @CAPS1 to her mum that she can past it. I also, think that because the hibiscus gives them strenghth and she got more confident in herself to past the test.	1	1		1																					
1845	4	The author chose to end the story this way for several reasons. Some of the reasons is that it creates a feeling of hope in the reader, tells us we always have another chance and the importance of persistence. The ending paragraph creates a feeling of hope since it shows how everything will return and others will be another chance. The author chose to put this in the text since it creates a happy note to end on and give the reader happiness of knowing there is hope. Another reason the author chose to end the story with this paragraph is that it tells the reader that you always get another chance no matter what you do. The author wanted to impart this on the reader since it is an important lesson to know. The ending also tells the reader that persistance is very important in life and almost essential to live. The author shows this by talking about the snow melting, the geese returning and the flower blooming which are things that happen constantly and almost stop because they refuse to give up and die. Therefore, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph for several reasons. The author chose to end it this way since the paragraph gives a lot of hope to the reader and gives the idea of a second chance. The author also chose to end with this paragraph since it has several analogies to persistance which is vital in life.   	3	3		3																					
1846	4	The authoR concludes the stoRy with this paRagRaph because he is saying that Saeng likes to do thing in the spring when she sees flowers gRowing because she feels like she is at home, so she feel moRe confident. about passing the test.	1	1		1																					
1847	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", the author concluded the story with the quote ""when they come back, Saeng's vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" the auther put this paragraph as the concluding thought to stress that Saeng is determined to make a change. She failed the test but wants to take it again. Her grandmother's resemblance is in the flower so if the flower budds, then her grandmother will be back in a sense. When he grandmother ""comes back"" then @PERSON1 will feel as if her grandmother is giving her strength and encouragement to try the test again."	2	2		2																					
1848	4	The auther ends with that paragraph to show how Saeng, like the budding  Hibiscus, will get a new start in the spring and overcome obstacles.	1	1		1																					
1849	4	The auther concludes the story with, �when they cam back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and tis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I think the auther used that conclusion to make the reader want to finish the story on their own. Or he could write another story to finish it. Most authors conclude their storys like this so the reader is in control about the ending.	1	1		1																					
1850	4	Based on my understanding of the story I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to emphize what will happened as well as to gate back to get to readler to thinking and build te excitement and with question as well as though in the head after reading the pessage. to my self to capture the reader attention as to the following upto and wondering of she survive and was able to adapt to the lifestyle that she was not use to and also see test her ability to see if she will be able to survive the different types of season and to know that no matter what you face in life their is alway more obstacles a head of you.	2	1		2																					
1851	4	The author choose to end the story with that paragraph for emotional meanings. The last paragraph is saying she will re-take the test when the hibiscus is blooming in the spring. She hopes that the blooming hibiscus will give her strength to pass the test. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland and gives her comfort. Saeng hopes the sight of the blooming hibiscus will remind her of her home and give her strength to pass the test.	2	1		2																					
1852	4	The author ends the story in this way because the plant and leaving of the geese represent change to Saeng. The hibiscus isn't the same as she remembers from back home. The budding of the hibiscus shows Saeng's happiness from home. This paragraph shows that the familiarity of the budding plant gives Saeng courage and the ability to overcome her obstacle. The geese in this paragraph represent the keeping of time. The plant will budd at the time the geese return in the spring. If the author hadn't included this final paragraph, the full effect of memories for Saeng wouldn't have been fully portrayed. This line implies that Saeng was unable to overcome her obstacle because of the newness of this place. when the budds bring her a sense of home, she will be able to defeat the obstacle of her driving test. She will be more confident.	1	2		2																					
1853	4	The author includes that because it show that she is not given up. Since she is not given up she can have more trys.	1	1		1																					
1854	4	"There are many reasons wht the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. At first, the story begins with a tone of sadness and seing fact ""as Saeng walks home after failing her driver's test"" this quote sets the tone as sadness because she has failled a very important test and she is walking alone. ""She sees a familier plant"" is when the hope comes back into the story. When she brings the plant she had purchased here to her mother also sees delinlted. "" where did you get it?"" her mother aasked, and Saeng replied ""I bought it."" She bought it for @MONEY1 more then her mother said for all of the seeds in the garden. As time went on it was clear to her mother the plant signifies strength and hope to her daughter and endyat the plant with have as well I remember a time upon my mother bought me a work-candle cat desdion. I felt it was a waist of money, but when @CAPS1 saw her light delights for I it with love as well. When Saeng's mother felt have from thr plants made Saeng happy and gave her courage the driver's test again. is the reason why the author chose to conclude the story with Saeng vowing to attempt the driver's test again. "	3	3		3																					
1855	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending but I have no idea on what that means so the author should explain what it means not me.	0	0		0																					
1856	4	the Author concluded the story with this paragraph because @CAPS1 was try intoto let us know what happen after the story was done. and tryed to make it clear and that�s why I think that @CAPS1 came up with that idea to conclude with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
1857	4	The author concludes this paragraph because Saeng is going to wait untill winter is over so she can have a fresh beginning. She wants to try again because the last time she messed up and tilled the plants. Saeng wants to become a gardener like her mother.	0	0		0																					
1858	4	The author of this essay includes those sentences as the conclusion to make it that she will realize that they are coming back.	0	0		0																					
1859	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow�� to show that Saeng got stronger. She got, stronger because she adjusted to her new home and new environment. Saeng is more confident in herself to take the test again. She doesn�t want to cry again, like she did in her last test. Being more confident and more adjusted is the reason why she has become stronger, and the reason why she wants to take the test again is because she is stronger.	2	2		2																					
1860	4	Confidence, persistance, memories � all things that Saeng has �that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy, she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and @CAPS1 from Vietnam; @CAPS1 she sees reminds her of it, that last paragraph, where it says, �then I will take that test again,� shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she won�t give up, Saeng misses almost @CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. She also misses her family and how they look and dress. Her memories were probably hold her back from concentrating hard on her drivers test, she knows she wanted to do good so she bought the flower in hopes that would make her feel better. Hopefully, Saeng�s life will get better in the United states and she will learn to love this country.	1	2		2																					
1861	4	Because withe the blooming of the hibiscuse plant comes new hope. In the story she sees the hibiscuse as her old life and with the budding of the plant starts a new chapter in the young girls life.	1	1		1																					
1862	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he�s trying to prove his point. I think that Saeng was comparing herself to the flower. For example the flower was originally a wild flower and then and then it was planted in a pot. Saeng was free happy girl but then she had to move to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng feel like they are out of place. Since in the story Saeng is similar to the flower then at the end then at the end of the story I think that Saeng thinks that if the flower can survive the winter then she can survive @LOCATION1 and she can pass the test. This is why I think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across.	3	2		3																					
1863	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he or she wants to show Saeng is determined to not fail that drivers test. The author wants to leave Saeng on a good note so she wont be sad. When she takes the test again shell be better prepared and know what shes expecting. Shell have a better winter.	1	1		1																					
1864	4	I think the author concludes the story as he or she did to teach a lesson. No matter what stands in your way or no matter what slows you down never give up. You should keep on trying. If you fail something, try again and again until you get it right.	1	1		1																					
1865	4	@CAPS2, memories, hard @CAPS1 – All are reasons why the author conluds the story with this “When They come back, saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddng, Then I will take the test again. First @CAPS2 because she failed her test first so it takes some guts and will power to go back and even try it again. Also because when she remember her grandmother it upsets her so that definatly takes @CAPS2 and the human will power to do her test a second time. Next memories. I @CAPS4 she keeps wanting to do this test because she has had so many good memories with her grandmother and doesn’t want to ever forget them. But again goes back to the will power or the want to, to go back and do the test a second time. Last All the Hard @CAPS1. All the Hard @CAPS1 because She knows what her grandmother  ment to her and threw all the things or Hard @CAPS1 that her grandmother put out she saw and wants to honaor or apreciate all of the stuff that her grandmother did for her. These are the reasons that @CAPS3 @CAPS4 the author ended with that Paragraph rather than some other paragraph	2	2		2																					
1866	4	The author include s the last paragraph to show that she still has hope. it is the last sentence because @CAPS1  fong Ho wants to show that when all seems lost and your at the end of the line you can always hope for the better when spring comes so will a new beginning not only saeng�s plant but also for her life in a different country.	1	2		2																					
1867	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus�chose to end the story with that paragraph to reenforce the theme of the story and conclude with a hopeful tone. The theme of the story is adjusting to new circumstances and making the best out of each change. ""Saeng vowed silently to herself"" tells the audience that Saeng is making an effort to fit in and find the good in her new life. The hopeful tone that is created is a way to show that Saeng is willing to accept changes in life and wants to do her best to overcome obstacles. She says, �I will take that test again�. The test represents the obstacles she will overcome when efforts applied. The hibiscus in the sentence ""�when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding...� @CAPS1 starting over. The budding hibiscus is compared to Saeng with a fresh start and determination to achieve her goals of adjusting to a new lifestyle. The author chose this paragraph to conclude the selection to highlight the theme and symbolize a new start"	2	2		2																					
1868	4	I think the author concludes the story with that statement because the audience can then compare saeng and the hibiscus. After reading that statement, I realized saeng and the hibiscus are alike because they are both going to make it through and come out on top, (Saeng getting her license and the hibiscus bidding) @CAPS1 the author might have ended the story with that statement because it shows that saeng is committed to working toward her goal and won�t give up. �Saeng  vowed silently to herself, �I will take that test again�, Finally I think  the author concluded the story with that statement because it gives the audience the satisfaction of knowing what is going to happen to saeng but leaving a little mystery for the audience to fill in how  they want. For example, I know saeng is going to take the test again and I believe she will pass it, @CAPS2, another person reading it might believe she failed again and had to retake it again.	2	3		3																					
1869	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the reader compare the girl to the geese and the hibiscus. The geese leave for the. winter and then come back in the spring, however the geese also show how the girl is going to come back and take the drivers test again in the spring. The hibiscus dies off over the winter and starts budding again in the spring, this shows that winter is its weakness. Like the hibiscus the girl overcomes her weakness of not being able to drive by remembering her homeland. The author puts this paragraph at the end of the story so you can see that the girl is like the geese and the hibiscus.	3	2		3																					
1870	4	I think the author concluded the story with that phrase because it shows she will mature. She is saying that she was not ready for all the challenges she was going to face, For example she did not pass her test but instead of crying about it she just said I will take it again next year. In the story she also longed for her homeland, which she truley missed. She coped with this by buying a winter hibiscus to remind her not only of her homeland but also of her grandmother overall the main character showed depth and maturity throughout the piece.	3	2		3																					
1871	4	The author concludes the story the way that she does because it shows Saeng�s willingness to adapt to her surroundings, just like the hibiscus. Saeng needs to adapt to her new home in @LOCATION1, and the hibiscus needs to adapt for the upcoming winter. Saeng vows to herself, �When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�� @CAPS1 from this, you can tell that Saeng has hope for both herself and the hibiscus. Initially, Saeng was very reluctant to accept her home. She says of the hibiscus, �it�s not like the kind we had before.� But she realized that the hibiscus could be a reminder of home as well as reminder to change for her new home. She knew that if the hibiscus could survive the winter, she could survive living somewhere new.  	2	2		2																					
1872	4	The author concludes this story with the promise Saeng made to herself to take the test again, come springtime, because Saeng is having trouble adapting to her new home, and she won�t give up on fitting in after only one failure. Remembering her home and that she will never be able to return are painful thoughts to Saeng and memories of it help her cope with her loss. The hibiscus and other familiar flowers she found comforted her, because they reminded her of home. At springtime when the geese return and the hibiscus starts blooming, Saeng will feel ready again to take the test, the spring represents the chance for another try, and a new beginning.	2	2		2																					
1873	4	The author concludes the story with the last paragraph. The author chose because the sentence informs you Saeng will take the test agin. In paragraph @NUM1 Saeng tell�s her mother she faild the test. So by the time spring comes around the hibiscus will start budding and Saeng will retake the test. Also the geese left the home temporally because of snow. So she sort of compares herself to the geese because she missis her home. The geese will return when the time is right, that is what the author concludes in the story�s paragraph.	2	1		2																					
1874	4	I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because the plant represent to being determined to survive. In other words, the hibiscus brings Saeng a good luck for her next driving test after winter season uhen the hibiscus is budding. Also, the reason why the author concluded the sentence to show what her plan for the future	1	1		1																					
1875	4	In the story �� Winter Hibiscus,�� the author concludes the story with this paragraph  for many reasons. This paragraph shows that Saeng  will not give up, she  will wait for next time  to come around to take the test. It also means she will be well prepared and will have a list  of  confidence in passing  this test. It gives the reader an idea that Saeng will not give up and she will complete the test. Her mother will be proud of her  for it and it shows Saeng will never give up. Just like when she said �let�s plant it, right now,�� T his example shows that even though Saeng had failed the the test and disapointed her mother,she will never give up and she still has hope in the plant just like how her mother has hope for Saeng.         	2	2		2																					
1876	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is talking about when Saeng vowed silently because she is thinking about what had happen a long time ago with her mom, the plants in her garden. Saeng was thinking about when everything comes back how will it be with the return of Spring, when the snow melts how will things be, the geese retorning and she will take the test again, that is what She was vowed silently to herself about. That is how i thik the author will conclude the story with this paragraph included wit it.	1	1		1																					
1877	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. In this story it about a @PERSON1, a girl and her mother. The girl is given money to buy a plant seeds. She spend @MONEY1 on this plant. Her mother get upset, but every thing turn on it, lk they had egg omlets with bits of melon.	1	1		1																					
1878	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she wants to show that after everything that happened, saeng will move on and try hard. For example, when she said, �When they come back in the spring, When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� By ending the story like this, it leaves the reader in suspense because they do not know if the geese will return. The author seems to be showing the reader that Saeng is starting to adapt to her new country and make it like her old one. For example, when the mother said, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.� This shows that they want their new country to be more like their old one and when it is, she will be happy. Therefore, the author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how she will adapt to the change in her environment.   	2	2		2																					
1879	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because she can not wait until spring because her plant will budd and it will remind her of her home land again. She can not wait to take the test in spring because she would have been alsole to stayed and she @MONTH1 pass the test in the spring because she did not pass it the first time she toke the test. Maybe she concluded the story with this paragraph because she @MONTH1 like the spring and she can not wait for it to come.    	1	1		1																					
1880	4	I believe there is a meaningful reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think that the author will feel more confortable and ready to take the test. I was able to come to this conclusion because by waiting for winter to be over to take the test again, she is giving herself time to prepare. Also, she is waiting for the hibiscus plant to bud. Something. I was able to extract from the fact that she wants to wait for the hibiscus is the presence of confort, the whole story revolves around how saeng was able to confort herself by reminiscing on her past experiences in Vietnam. When she feels that an important part of her life is returning, that she can become comfortable and focused. I think the author would conclude the story with this paragraph is because the author wants to stress the importance of this flower involving how saeng lives her life	3	3		3																					
1881	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show she has hope. She believes that she can pass the test when everything is back to normal, in the spring. In the spring the geese will return and the hibiscus will be budding. This makes her feel more at home because it was always like this before she moved. Also she likes the geese and the hibiscus and these things might make her feel more comfortable. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show she has hope.	1	2		2																					
1882	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph he/she wanted to compare Saeng life with the plant. For example, in the story Saeng had just failed her driving test and then she saw a plant the reminded her of homeland. From the flower shop to the house, she is comparing her home land to the flower which shows how she relates to it. So the concluding paragraph shows how when the hibiscus is budding and starts a new phase she will too and go for her drivers license.	2	1		2																					
1883	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng�s determination to adapt to the change in her life. In the story saeng fails her drivers test and is struggling to adapt to her new life in @LOCATION1. However, when she sees that the hibiscus and geese are familiar, she is determined to adopt as well. Saeng buys a hibiscus because it reminds her of home. This not only comforts her it also makes her miss her old home more. The hibiscus can survive in both @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1, so it helps saeng realize that she can as well. The author includes the geese because they help saeng realize that she is becaming more familiar with things in the United states, so she can continue to adapt. Saeng says that she now recognizes the �V� shape of the geese. Realizing that she is becoming more accostomed to @LOCATION1 and she is able to survive helps her reach the determination to retake and pass her driving test. The author includes it to summarize the story theme of adopting to change.	3	3		3																					
1884	4	I think that the author put that sentence to get a little personal with the character so you can relate to that person.	0	0		0																					
1885	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the importance of new beginnings and to accentuate the theme in the story. The theme is that one must overcome hardships and seek new beginnings. The springtime is a representation of a new beginning. So, the new beginning of spring will allow her to start all over again on the drivers� test. Also, the author uses the paragraph to show the symbolic qualities of everyday things. Just how the hibiscus reminded her of home life, the geese will remind her of springtime.	2	2		2																					
1886	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author Minfong Ho concludes the story with that paragraph because it was a way of saying shes going to forget about what happen in the past with her failing her test and shes going to do better the next time. Its like the author is saying she will be reborn again like the hibiscus, when the spring comes. Through the story Saeng had to adjust just like the hibiscus. And the hibiscus inspired Saeng to do well where shes at. So it�s a new beginning to Saeng, after all her learning from hibiscus."	2	2		2																					
1887	4	It�s kind of like a theme for the story. The hibiscuss inspire her to want to do things. I guess it brings memories of her home country and makes her want to try new things. This is significant to the story because it shows you how important the hibiscus was to saeng.	1	1		1																					
1888	4	I think the authour chose to end the story this way to show that the girl is remembering her past and being at, ease. with the flower she at a since of peace. The writer wants to convey that no matter what your used to you can find something that can bring you happiness and a since of focus.	1	1		1																					
1889	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 she is detarmand to pass that test and is not going to give up until she passes it.	1	1		1																					
1890	4	The reason why I feel the authour ended the story with this paragraph is because she is showing how the charater has matured and how the charater grew in her circumstance. This shows that because you failed once doesn�t mean your going to fail again. Also it�s okay to feel out of place there is alway going to be a time in life where a new beginning is going to start so it is your choice to take that chance or be stuck in your own ways but the decision is always up to you.	2	1		2																					
1891	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by �Minfong Ho� she ends the story by saying, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. �I-I failed the test�. As many kids do, Saeng failed her driving test and she is crucially upset about it. nobody wants to fail at something and it is almost a humiliating experience to have failed at a test. knowing that others have already successfully passed. With the quote in the introduction paragraph, or the one in the question, it was written as a sign of symbolism. When the geese return back north, it is to show that they are ready to �start over� again or to �try again�. When the hibiscus is budding it is trying to �start life� again. Saeng seeing objects doing things over and over again empowers her to want to succeed and try again. She realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail. Minfong concludes with that quote because she understands that no matter what the obstacle, you must press forward and keep trying in order to succeed. She realizes success can only come from hard work and commitment, and that that is what makes a great, strong individual.	2	3		3																					
1892	4	The reason why the author concludes the paragraph with that sentence is because her wants to let reader know that it's not over. He wants the reader to know @ORGANIZATION1 will not forget. And also that all this will happen again.	1	1		1																					
1893	4	The author concludes the ending as �I will take that test again� meaning that the things she going through now is going to happen again but next time she will be peperd. Saeng has a very difficult time moving to another country and getting comfortable in the place the mother suports her as she go throught winter the hibiscus that she bought is a symbol that represent more than it selfs, in this text of winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho shows this biscus that she bougth when she was in wrost time, she went throug winter with the hibiscus nand at the last paragraph of the story express �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding� she is thinking of the feature and how she �saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring. She can�t wait until winter is over and is just waiting for the spring to come.	2	2		2																					
1894	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to tell us what she does once she gets back in the spring. That means when she gets back, she will then be taking care of the plants. When she gets  gets  back she wants the snow to melt and everything. That is what the author is telling me from the story.	0	0		0																					
1895	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to ensure the reader that she will say again. Also, the author concludes the story this way to show the reader that no matter where you go in life it will always be something and or someone their to assure you of everything. The author also wanted the reader to feel a sence of similarity to the character meaning no matter how out of place you feel its always something you can relate to	1	1		1																					
1896	4	The author concludes the story with thise paragraph so that we buy his comming book, or so that we get more exited.	1	1		1																					
1897	4	"In this story theauther deicides to end the story with this paragraphe, ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buding, then I willtake that test agien."" because she wants to take the test when every thing is isanters, de forexample she wants everything she likes in her nuforment such as the flowers, the geese and the whether. Another reason why I say the author ends the story with that paragragh because she wants to be, ua eviorment like the one that she was in her home country forexemple there was no snow it was like sping time all ver around. This is why I say that the auther ended the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1898	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, that cannot pass the test until it is. �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of before had become through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. �This shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants because she is thinking back to other times where things have been strange during the winter and better in the spring and @DATE2 seasons when the plants are budding, so she believes that she will actually pass the drivers test when she feel comfortable, when the plants have budded.	2	2		2																					
1899	4	The geese flying south for the winter and the hibiscus budding are normal things to Saeng. The author wanted to conclude the story with this to show that Saeng felt comfort in things that she was acustomed to. Saeng wanted to have the geese and hibiscus there to feel more comfortable while taking her driving test. Saeng still longs for home and does not quite feel like she fits in the u.s. The hibiscus gives her that comfort feeling like she is home again, in Vietnam, Saeng still feels homesick because she wants things to be how they were. The plants in the green house along with the disappointment of failing her driving test bring her to the emotional state that she was in. In the second to last paragraph the author talks about the feeling of repetition Saeng has when seeing the v formation. Saeng feels that in the winter she will not have the same comfort feeling as when she can see the hibiscus and the geese flying overhead. It says when Saeng arrived in the @LOCATION2 she had nothing that was familiar to her.  Now she gets that feeling from the geese and plants. The author concluding by saying Saeng will take her driving test when the winter ends is a good closing because it gives you some insight as to what Saeng is going to do.	3	2		3																					
1900	4	"I think the author concludes the sentence then they come back, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geess and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"" is that because it was winter and the school was closed. When the geese come back it will be spring, so it will be time to go back to school. I think thats the reason."	0	0		0																					
1901	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes his story with an odd ending. ��when they come back,� Saeng vowed silently to herself,�in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding. then I will take that test again.�� I believe that beyond the literal meaning the author is showing how Saeng is adapting to the new country. By failing her driver�s test she also failed in adapting and accepting the new country By vowing to try again it also shows that she is willing to give the country another chance. �She found she was still too shaky to say the words at home..� I believe that this is showing that she still didn�t consider this country her home. She was still stuck on her past.       	3	3		3																					
1902	4	The author concludes this story in the paragraph to show that saeng wont stop, just because she faild one first time. It also shows that she is not going to let certaint things keep her down.	1	1		1																					
1903	4	The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningfull. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, �I will take that test again.� By use of the word will, the author shows the girls determination. She didn�t say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new begginigs. The story quotes, �when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again. This shows that in spring, the new begginig of life she will take the test. This is why I believe the author ended the story this way.	2	2		2																					
1904	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� made a good choice to conclude the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.� This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become �almost familiar to her now� The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng�s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her �obstacle,� and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng�s life will have come full circle.	3	3		3																					
1905	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its important when she says when geese returns and this hibisus is budding then she says she will take that test again and to tell the reader when she will take that test again. Thats way its in the story.	0	0		0																					
1906	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it emphasiseS that Saeng is willing to retake the test when it comes back. I also think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story the @NUM1 to last paragraph says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repititon of the season upon season, almost farmiliar to her now.� This sentence shows me that @PERSON1 is slowly getting used to the new place. Also how she is changing her mind about the pLant and the fact that even though its not the same, it can still have meaning. Therefore, I think the author made a good choice in ending the story with this paragraph.   	2	2		2																					
1907	4	The last paragraph states �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.� I believe the author has ended with that paragraph to state the fact when her new home is like her old home maybe she will feel more confident and more in her place, instead of cold winter total opposite of where she use to live. The feeling of her old home, in her new home will make her more positive and comfortable. So then she will take the test feeling at home and pass.	1	2		2																					
1908	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that�s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can�t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. �She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now�. Saeng didn�t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won�t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her. �She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" With Saeng�s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1909	4	The authour meerly states the obvious within this story of shortness. This exerpt mainly mainly means that when spring arrives she will return to the Green house or area with all the plants. When she gets there, the girllwill atempt to act the plant that grews wild in her home country and bring it to her new home.	0	0		0																					
1910	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that kind of paragraph, I think he�s trying to show saeng as the type of person to not give up and always to keep growing just like the hibiscus plant. And because she realizes that most of the things that she thought as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season  that was almost familiar to her. Saeng notices that she will still have next season when the plant has grown and the geese fly into a distinctive V again	1	1		1																					
1911	4	"Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph because to show how Saeng fills. In the paragraph Saeng said ""I will take that test again"" means will I go throught the same stuff. Also @CAPS1"	1	1		1																					
1912	4	The author ends the story this way to show that there can always be a happy ending. The geese came back  and the girl was happ because of  it.	0	0		0																					
1913	4	The author concluded the story with his paragraph because these are all things that she isnt going to give up on.She is trying to say that when everything she believes in successed thats when she is going to take her driving test.Her mother says that the flower is never going ti give up and it�s strong enough to live through the winter.The geese are going to always come back.That is exactly what she is going to do with her test.She is not going to give up on the test,she is going to keep trying untill she passes.	1	2		2																					
1914	4	Saeng feels more comfirtable in the spring because it reminds her of home. She probably never experienced snow or winter before. So nothing in this time of year reminds her of home. In the spring it does because the geese return and the hibiscus grow again making everything feel like its her home again. Conferdence is what she receives when spring comes again. 	1	1		1																					
1915	4	The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with that paragraph because it sums up everything the hibiscus has given Saeng for strength and courage. Just like the hibiscus, Saeng felt out of place in this new country and the hibiscus helps her realize the importance in adapting to her survival in order to live happily. She can�t alway be dwelling in the past but learn to like where she lives now. Therefore, when the author writes, �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� it is a direct symbol of Saeng budding or opening her mind to the @CAPS1 ways, like learning to drive. 	2	2		2																					
1916	4	I believe the author of �winter Hibiscus� used this for the last paragraph because it is saying when she sees that hibiscus it will give her memories of home again which will bring encouragement for the test. �The geese symbolize Saeng's determination to pass the test and try like the new country. Saeng explains, �she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the @NUM1) this quote creates a vivid image in my mind that lets me know Saeng will really go and take that test when she has encouragement from not only the geese but the hibiscus also.	3	3		3																					
1917	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because it is in a way letting you know that everything�s going to be alright. Saeng is going to retry her drivers test again and everything is back to the way she likes best.It gives you a sense of hope, that everything is going to be alright wi her. Also, that she is going to start making the best out of life. I believe it�s saying to that is why I think the author concludes wi that paragraph.	1	2		2																					
1918	4	The Author uses this paragraph to @CAPS1 the Story because it shows how Saeng wants to adapt to this country and she is allready beging to understand it and like it. When it @CAPS2 �and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� It is a metaphor about herself when the @CAPS3 begins to bloom and @CAPS4 Just as she is starting to bloom and @CAPS4. This is why the Author endeded with this passage.	1	1		1																					
1919	4	Saeng said that when the tree she bought starts budding she will take the test over. She means that without that plant she just does not feel like taking the test. She does not because the plant was with her, her whole life. She also thinks that she can not do it, without that plant. Saeng means that since she�s had a plant like that her whole life then she thinks she needs it, but I don�t think she really needs it. I guess it just �comforts� her.	1	1		1																					
1920	4	The author didn�t think that Saeng was ready to take the test until she knew more about it. Saeng had a lot on her mind of gardening since she didn�t have any friends in school she didn�t want to go their the would have nobody to talk to its good that Saeng vowed because she will never know if she would do good or bad, So the author realized that Saeng will take the test and pass.	0	0		0																					
1921	4	The author concludes with this paragraph mostly because she wants to emphasize her memoreies of her homeland by saying that she would take the test again driving the next spring. This is due to that fact that she knows as soon as spring comes back there will be a lot of memories coming back to her since during spring animals come out and trees blossom making it all beautifu for her to take the test again with support from her memories of her country.	1	2		2																					
1922	4	After reading the story �Winter Hibiscus� by: Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a unique way that demonstrates a will to survive. For example in the text the author writes and explain how the plants �dok faeng-noi,� has adapted to its cold environment is different to the ones back at home. This demonstrates the idea of survival be the fact that in the past this plant migrated to a place that seemed warm at the time, but when cold streets, it found ways to change itself and adapt all based on the instinct to survive. Another example in the text is the author     Saeng telling herself that in the spring she will try and take the test again. This demonstrates the will to survive because when Saeng failed the test she felt a sense of meloncoly and failure. The fact that she had the courage to prepare for the test in spring shows how she human being wants to live and for her to live in a new country she must adapt by passing that test to become a survivor.	2	3		3																					
1923	4	The author concludes. the story with this paragraph to show the story about snows on the roads. He shows people how to watch where they are going. In conclusion, the paragraph would show he made through the snow storm.	0	0		0																					
1924	4	In the story � Winter Hibiscus � Saeng vowes to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding. then I will take the test again. The author concludes   with this paragraph because the hibiscus brings her comfort from home and confidence. �Almost  familiar to her now.� This quote from the story shows that things are starting to be right and she is starting to feel comforting her by making her relize that where she is living now can be similar to where she used to live. When around the hibiscus it brings back memorys of the flowers that   they used to have where they lived. Both the mother and the daughter appreciate the flower they found because it is similar to what they had back home. For example, in the story the mother says �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here.� This shows that they appreciate its similarity to the old hibiscus. In conclution the author concludes this story with that paragraph because it helps readers to understand the importance of the  girls memory of where she used to live.	2	3		3																					
1925	4	The author choose this end to show that saeng hasn't given up on how she is living yet. It shows that even though she really loved her hometown, and feels and remembers a lot back then. She had taken the test and failed, living where she was living then just seemed too much pressure on her. Although she hasn't quite adapted throughly she will try her best to surcome situations that are brought upon her. It gives the reader hope by ending the story like this, instead of just leaving the reader at she bought a flower after failing a test and moves on with her life. For example when she failed the test she seemed distressed and very angry. I,�I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. For a long moment mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shedding it to bits.�it anger Saeng how she had to leave her happy past life for one that is different and challenging. When faced with a challenge extreme emotiona situations occur. Saeng just needed hope and the author choose this to betray to then reader there is a chance of hope!	3	3		3																					
1926	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus the author minfong to ends the story as she does for many reasons.	0	0		0																					
1927	4	The auther cncludes the story with this paragraph because it wraps it all up and sums it into one. It is explaining that she is looking forward to the spring when the hibiscuss is	1	1		1																					
1928	4	"The reason why at the end of the story she ended it with ""when they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring; when the shows melt & the gees return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the again�. is because shes making the statement that the birds have where they live all the time & the plant can live here & not when she has & still live shes saying she can to if she tries so she will wait till birds came back are ok the plant buds living in her new home so everything will be okey then she will be able to take the test because she understand & believe she will feel safer & a lot better."	1	1		1																					
1929	4	The story like this for mine reasons. First of all he ended the story to make the readers think about what will happen if there is a part two. Secondly, so he can make a part two. That is way he ended the story like that.	1	1		1																					
1930	4	She vowed this because just as the geese would return she shall. also as the test themselves to learn and grow she would. Furthermore she @CAPS1 the the test of love, survial and family tridition she would know that comeing. back was destiny. In example they come to raise their young for the journey that they shall face and Help them to  realise that they always will come back because their lives started there and to always exacpe cold and man kind that wants to harm their lives. The winter months are very harsh there so They know that they have to leave just to @CAPS2. She learns the lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival.	1	1		1																					
1931	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he made a comittment to himself of taking the test all over again. He probably said that because there�s always a next time for everything. mostly the reason he said it was to remind himself that theres always another try of everything. Finally that most people such know that everyone get a second chance.	1	1		1																					
1932	4	The author concludes the story like this because the seasons are changing and there finising there cycle and starting a new one. Thus I think this is a good way to end a story like this because I kinda sets a mood and a feel at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
1933	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with this paragraph because it conveys the theme of the story, adjusting to changed in life. So many things have changed for Saeng and she hasn�t full adjusted yet to the way of life. Yet she learns that she needs to be determined to adapt and survive like Hibiscus. The text states, �In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding� The hibiscus teaches Saeng to never give up, like the hibiscus doesn�t give up and survives during the winter. She learns to be determined and even though she failed the test the first time, her memories have helped her and she is going to go for it again. These ideas are in the last paragraph because they summarize the idea of not giving up even if you feel out of place. She has slowly gotten used to this new place and recognizes the seasons now as she thinks this last thought.	3	2		3																					
1934	4	To set a tone and to talk about how they look. Also that little paragraph can also start another book or to get you into studing things. It could also compare Your life with the geeses life. Like explaning what hardships you went through.	1	1		1																					
1935	4	The author chooses to end this story like this for many reasons. Throughout the story, the author gives you hints of Saeng being homesick. He relates this to the flower being strong enough to survive the winter months. Meaning she�ll survive also. Although the flower isn�t the same as she had at home, change is inevitable and atleast she could hold on to that. So I believe the author decides to end the story with this to say just like the plant she�ll survive and try to adjust in the spring also like her driving test.     	2	2		2																					
1936	4	The author concluded like that because he was the one to score the lines below what you write. Score of to level and key better. To all the thing he was surprised to kindly be seprated by for there by up so blese geve one a high sew o of will sweit all at you up to the end of the authrs concludes 	0	0		0																					
1937	4	"I belive that the author included this paragraph to show that you she didn't give up, to show that she kept trying after she failed. Saeng said to her mother ""I failed the test"". Also to make her sound proud and happy to try the test over again. Also I have failed test. I also said that I would take them over but I didn't. So the author put that in their to show how determin she was going to sound."	1	1		1																					
1938	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it lets the reader know that there is still a chance for Saeng; she is not giving up on herself or the test. While reading you will find that Saeng is comforted by memories of her homeland, and obviously this move to another country was hard on her. In the story the author writes, �It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center- just as she had known it would feel.� The feeling and scent of the hibiscus flower comforted her. She then proceeded to purchase the plant, because she failed the test she needed something to lift her spirits back up once again. The author decided to end the story with Saeng stating that once �this hibiscus plant is budding,then l will take that test again� because as the reader should have learned by now, the hibiscus plant has been the only positive aspect in her life since the move. It is giving her motivation to once again take the driver�s test, and it is also letting the reader know that Saeng is not giving up.	3	2		3																					
1939	4	Minfong Ho concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus� with a strong paragraph to show the passion and will of Saeng in her new home to complete the test. When the closing sentences states that Saeng �vowed� to pass the test, it shows her determination to fight. This will could be from the memories of her grandmother and the flowers that reminded her so closely of her old home. Saengs courage to face her homesickness is the seed of the story, and by ending it with such a bold statement, Minfong Ho blooms this seemingly sad tale into a story of willpower and drive to pass her test. �Winter Hibiscus� is a passage of heartache, despair, and yerning for a past life. By closing the story with the uplifting promise from Saeng, Minfong Ho puts a happy ending to a possibly sad tale.	3	2		3																					
1940	4	The author concludes the story with this because the season is ending and also the story is ending.	0	0		0																					
1941	4	The author concludes the story with this type of paragraph because the author knows it�s bond to happen again. I know this because in that paragraph it says �in the spring����.I will take this test again�. She is just preparing herself for next year. This is why I think this paragraph ended with the story.	1	1		1																					
1942	4	Saeng was thinking to herself after dinner about the test. She knew that she can do much better than before. And she made a vowed to herself saying that once winter finally ends and spring start, she would take the test again, and this time she will pass it with flying colors.	1	1		1																					
1943	4	Saeng wants to take the test again when it is beautiful out and the hibiscus is buddy. The plant shows the beautiful achievement of passing the test. The plant will help her past the test by being strong, tough, and nicely finished. These characteristics reprecent the girl and the flower. The day was a good day and wants to take the test on the same day. The plant was strong and tought. This represents the girl in that time she didn�t pass. She told her mother and was very understandig about it. The plant represents beautiful things and the geese represent beautiful things. The girl wants to do that on that time of day and thinks she will get it next time. When she completes and past her test she wants to come home to the beautiful surroundings to remember that day. The author concluded with that statement to represent the importance of the plant and the surroundings of when she wants to past the test.	1	2		2																					
1944	4	"The author might have concluded the story with that paragraph, because she wanted to remind the reader how sincearl, ""Saeng"" was to the hibiscus flower. I say this because through out the story @PERSON1 was very compassionate about the flower. I think she felt as through she could relate to the flower."	1	1		1																					
1945	4	The author ends with this paragraph because it symbolizes a new beggining, Saeng says, �I � I failed the test.� She is also really sad, she is making a commitment to get a fresh start on life, just like how the world does every spring. The theme of the story is when life seems hard take a new approach. She intends to retake the drivers test.	1	2		2																					
1946	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that Saeng will be ready to take the test in time. She first has to grow and adapt to the new surroundings. Just like the hibiscus flower and the geese. The hibiscus flower now has to adapt to its new surroundings outside of the store The geese are adapting to the surroundings by flying south for the winter. Saeng needs to still learn more and adapt before she can pass her drivers test. By ending the story with this paragraph it shows that Saeng realizes what she needs to do. She needs to stop thinking about where she used to live and begin her new life in a new country.	2	2		2																					
1947	4	"Minfong Ho ended her story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with an optomistic sentence. She concluded it this way because the main character of the story was beginning to lose hope. Saeng decided to retake the driving test when her hibiscus flower was blooming. This flower reminds her of her past life in Vietnam with her grandmother. ""Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb"". She preferred her life in Vietnam than hers in @LOCATION2. She was goint to wait until ""this hibiscus is budding,"" so she can feel more comfortable and happy. The author wanted to end it so Saeng would be happy. "	2	2		2																					
1948	4	The author ended the story with that because she is sad and she wants to give hope to the reader that you should never give up on any thing, always keep trying. Also it ends on a good note, if was like I stayed up in my @CAPS1 crying that would not be good ending. This ending gives hope to the reader and it also tells the reader to practice. This is because when spring comes a end the lady is going to practice driving so when she takes the test she want fail. Also the girl is getting happier at the end and that makes the reader happy. So in conclusion that ending for story has a good choose for many reasons, like making the reader happy, giving the reader couage to never give up, end to practice something if you fail it the first time. Also to help your mother when she is planting or digging up plant,	2	2		2																					
1949	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to develop the theme and to project what the main character will do after she plants the hibiscus, I believe that the theme of this story is adjusting to changes in life and the author builds upon this theme in the final paragraph. In the ending paragraph, the author writes, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author demonstrates how Saeng learns to adjust when things change in her life. In this instance, Saeng fails her driver�s test and to deal with this setback, she buys a hibiscus to remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new start test once the geese ??? (THIS @CAPS1 IS @CAPS2)	2	2		2																					
1950	4	So she did not forget to take the test again.	0	1		1																					
1951	4	Saeng did not give up on herself. She said she would take it over again then she might pass it. You will not always pass on your first try it takes a while sometime. Saeng encourage you to never to give up just cause you did not get it on your first time. She also builds confidence in herself. That�s why the author concluded the story that way.	1	1		1																					
1952	4	The author ended the story with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test in the spring, because he wanted to show that the geese and the hibiscus plant represent a sort of rebirth or revival to Saeng. He wanted to end the story on a positive note. Spring is an archotyal season. It is a season of birth and growing. Saeng saw the hibiscus after she failed the first test. It took her to her memories back in Vietnam, which comforted here she believes that maybe when she sees the plant florishing and she geese returning, she will experience that same revival again.	2	2		2																					
1953	4	"The author concludes the story with the last paragraph because Saeng failed the test at the beginning of the story. After going through the plants and learned new things, it is natural for Saeng to take the test again in the spring(end of the story).  I think this because Saeng  learned that she has  to get used to hung in @LOCATION1 and the plant remainded her  that she has to when  she saw the geese fly in the ""V""formation,it was the same as back at home in Vietnam. She realized that it was the same as Vietnam and she has to take that driver's test again in order to get used to living in @LOCATION1 with all of its changes. I also think that its prayer to end the story with her taking the driver's test in spring because the geese will come back,and the hibiscus is budding. This is the beginning for them as well as Saeng.                                                                                                       "	2	2		2																					
1954	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph show is that Saeng is willing to try again to try to get a plant that will remind her of her grand mother and  remind her of her old home where she @MONTH1 go back one day . So, she can see the near flower she loves and not the take   one.	1	1		1																					
1955	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� the author concludes the story the way he does to show that Saeng isn�t giving up. In the spring she will see the plant and remember her home which will help her not feel as homesick. �Plants she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood work.� This quote shows that when she sees familiar plants she is reminded of home, so in the spring when her plant blooms she will see it and feel more comforting and more at home which will help her find the strength to pass the driving test. So as the plant blooms, so does her comfort level.	2	1		2																					
1956	4	What l think the author was talking abount snow and it was add outside for the bays matter and snow started to melted.	0	0		0																					
1957	4	He concluded the story with that sentence because it told that she learned a lesson in life. all the way back home where she originally came from she missed her friends ibet and seeing her mother work out in the garden durring this time of year when its cold. I guess there poor in one way. In conclusion the choose this sentence because it sounds like she learned a lesson in life and even starting all over again but with a better understanding in her learning.	1	1		1																					
1958	4	Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her so she is going to take the test again after winter.	1	1		1																					
1959	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is more will power because she loves the hibiscus and what other way to end the story that have her comparing he self to the hibiscus because when she say  �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is is saying now this snow is slowing down the hibiscus. So the fail is slowing her down. So she is going to be reading to prepare for when the spring comes when the hibiscus is budding then she will be budding too by passing her test.	1	2		2																					
1960	4	  In the article the author concludes the story with Saeng vowing to herself that �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is bidding, then I will take that test again� because the spring and the hibiscus reminds her of home. For example in the article she gets shaky because she cant say home because she misses it too much. So she finds things that reminds her of it like a plant called dok faeng-noi. It�s not the real plant but she gets it to remind her where she comes from. In conclusion, Saeng finds a plant, she likes the soring because it reminds her home. How about what reminds you of home. Think about it.	2	2		2																					
1961	4	The reason that the author chose to end this story with this paragraph is to tell the reader that things get better as time goes on. Saeng failed the driver�s test because she wasnt ready. The flower bloomed before it was ready. The author is saying you need to be patient and good things will come your way	1	1		1																					
1962	4	"The author chose to conclude the paragraph with the sentence ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it shows how the strenghth of the hibiscus is related to Saeng's strenghth. In the story, after failing her drivers test, Saeng @CAPS1 comfort in a hibiscus native to her country. when she gets home her mother says �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This shows that saeng is faltiering in her new foriegn country. The end quote sums up that saeng @CAPS1 strenghth in the strenghth of the flowers. almost thinking if flower can survive in a land away from its home, why can't I?"""	3	2		3																					
1963	4	When she is ready and good she is saying she will take the test again. When she is ready and good and it is nice and beautiful out then she will have the confidence to take the test again. The author was trying to tell us how she felt about letting her mom down.	1	1		1																					
1964	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it's important to the story. Also it closes the story up. Its exploning that the girl is starting to adjust to the new area, and is going to try harder to get along well there. So by saying shes going to take the test again. It means shes going to look at it in a new way. The authur put this at the end trying to make sense of everything and show the girl had changed.	1	1		1																					
1965	4	In the short story �Winter hibiscus� The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author felt as thought Saeng would be ready to take thee test at that particular time.	1	1		1																					
1966	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its showing she still has hope. The hibiscus gives her hope and strength. In the spring she will take her test again and will hope to pass it. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
1967	4	"In the last paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by minfong Ho The author concludes by saying  ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". I think the author concludes with this quote because it shows her determination to overcome this obstacle, For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort and the ability to over come. Saeng is very strong and she believes off of that determination which comes from her past. The author concluded with that because it shows Saeng�s determination."	2	1		2																					
1968	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything."	2	2		2																					
1969	4	Why I think she added this is because she needs time to grow like the plant before she takes the test again. Sometimes you need more time to pass your test. going through school teaches more than stuff we need to know it helps us grow up, and how to understand life. I know myself as a tenth grader that I understand life more than I did in first. She still has a lot of growing mentaly about her past and preasnt.	1	1		1																					
1970	4	"I believe that the author ended the story with this line to show that hope for the girl was still there and that even perhaps the flower had inspired her a lot. I believe that when she says ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"", She specifically chose this time for her to start over, and try again just as everything else mentioned is. When it says, ""and this hibiscus is budding"", it shows that the flower is blooming again, with a fresh start and beginning again just as she would try to do when she tries again to succed at passing the test she must pass. also the tone of which said said this showed hope, she was hopeful and determined that next time around she would certainly pass."	2	3		3																					
1971	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that while this particular tale is over Saeng�s life will continue. The paragraph provides closure for the reader as well as explains that in time Saeng will take the test again, once she has further adapted to @LOCATION1 culture.	1	1		1																					
1972	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because wants her to be successful and do good.	0	0		0																					
1973	4	In the response that explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because this story was about a plant growing back every year around the same time. The paragraph ment like I think when the plant came back inspring & the geese would come back around it be another test of growing and not letting the plant die	0	0		0																					
1974	4	"From the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the author concludes this story with the paragraph of what Saeng vowed silently because it is to show Saeng�s determination. The hibiscus was the plant she found, that was closly resembled the one at �home,� to symbolize her conformt. The hibiscus symbolized her determination in life. �through the quiet repetiton of season upon season, almost familiar to her now� from this, you can conclude that Saeng is thinking of how she reconignzed the geese. It gives her greater confidence within herself. From this, �like the Geese she lifited her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched,"" and this explains that there is still hope inside of her. This paragraph conclusion the author had concluded ties together what Saeng is now hoping and believing in."	2	2		2																					
1975	4	Saeng vows this to herself at the end of the story to show that she will adapt to this change, just like the hibiscus will bud. She knows that it will be hard and take time, but in the end she will achieve approval and happiness. We see that it is already hard for her by the way she breaks down crying. And the way she talks to her mother. She symbolizes by planting the hibiscus that things are going to get better if she is not too stuck in the past.	2	2		2																					
1976	4	The author concludes the paragraph with a statement that Saeng said. It was a very good statement. The author ended with this to show that she is motivated and determined to do this. She shows she is motivated in many ways. she says, �Here let me help you mother.� This shows that she is motivated by helping her mother finish what she started. She is also determined by saying, �almost reluctantly she realizes that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through a quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familier now.� This shows that she wants to do something and she doesn�t think it is weird anymore. That is why the author concludes that statement.	1	2		2																					
1977	4	The Author concludes the story with this When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building then I will take that test again! because he or she are the ones who wrote the story. One information is her family moved to the united @ORGANIZATION1 from Vietnam. Second one is the Author could of made this story it was about her. Saeng fails her driving test.    	1	1		1																					
1978	4	The author concludes the �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph to show the narrator realizes that even though she�s in a new country, some things are still the same. So she becomes determined to pass the test. For example, the narrator said, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of are strange before had become, through the quick repetition of season upon season familiar to her now.�  This quote shows that the narrator has realized that even though aspects of how life has changed, some things remain same. This also shows that some things like the test were strange to her but now that she is familiar with it she could pass it. The narrator also said, �Saeng did not dare look at her mother in her eyes.� This quote shows that the narrator was disappointed with herself for not passing the test. This means that the test was very important to her with the  of pressure to pass, and of a new is ready to pass the test. But she�ll be more prepared. The theme of this story could be seen things discourage you. The narrator has gone through recently many but in the seasons.	3	2		3																					
1979	4	The author shows a willingness to try harder in this story. She states that, �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author realizes that she is going to have to adapt. Also, saying that she will wait till the spring, means she is going to try again, and not give up. The author has a sentimental value to. Insince she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud, I believe she is referring that hibiscus to her country. Insince she has left her country, the hibiscus is the closet thing she has to it, and therefore, she will wait with the flower	2	2		2																					
1980	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng now thinks about images associated with memories in her new home, as well as images she remembers from Vietnam. At the beginning of the story, in the floral shop, she remembers her grandmother, as well as a well, a hibiscus hedge, and other things that remind her of certain feelings and experiences. At the end of the story, she uses both the hibiscus, which reminds her of her previous home, and the canadian geese, which don't seem so unfamiliar to her anymore, to represent passing of time. She now sees her new home as having familiar things in it attached to memories, as her old love did.	2	2		2																					
1981	4	The aurthor concludes the story with this paragraph. In same ways. One reason why the aurthor concluded the story with this paragraph is because in the story she sad something she really wanted. So she took it home and showed her mom, Then her mom look at her weird, because in the story it said that �you what? Her mother stared at her increously.� So then she explains that she failed the drivers test, but she didn�t give up. So at the end of the story she said that she will take that test again. So in conclusion that is why the aurthor concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	2		2																					
1982	4	"The story elds with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed sileltly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. ""The author concludes with this to show determination to try again and to pass her driving test next year. Also the flowers reminded her of home in Vietnam. (for example, ""Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into childhood world."") and by next year when the flowers bloomed she would more determined and ready for the test again. Also, the flowers blooming resembels starting a new life and maybe it could be the same way for Saeng by passing her drivers test. That's why the auther ends with that statement."	2	2		2																					
1983	4	I think the auther concludes the story with the paragraph because it is saying I�ll never give up. She is determined to concor everything. I think she is saying she will take the test over and over until she succeeds. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because you should never give up.	1	1		1																					
1984	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author end the story saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying no matter what Saeng failed the drive test the first time she is not gaving up till she pass and get her driving. The author also concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is saying that Saeng can wait till winter end so she see the hibiscus is budding.	2	1		2																					
1985	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver�s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, ""in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .When the hibiscus is makeing a new start by budding in the spring Saeng will do the same ,by retaking her drivers test.With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about �What happened with the driver�s test ,what was the point of that ?�."	2	2		2																					
1986	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform what her hole meaning was. For example when she returned she felt great b/c she came back to were she belonged. One reason is what she �vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.� @CAPS1 meant that coming back was probably the best thing she could had done.	1	1		1																					
1987	4	well It seems like to me that the reason why the author wrote that as his or her ending is because basically to have sarcaism and put emphesis on what he was saying and making it clear that he wasn't going to take the test again, and basically if some one would haft to kill him in order to make him take that test again.	0	0		0																					
1988	4	The reason why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph is because she wants to test the hibiscus again when it returns. FOR evidence in the last paragraph it says, �when they come back saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return And this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� That�s why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph.    	0	0		0																					
1989	4	The author puts that as the conclusion because it is like a cycle. And he didn�t finish it with the end of the cycle because leaving readers with that curiosity edge gives suspense. This was a well written story and conclusion.  	1	1		1																					
1990	4	In the short story ��Winter Hibiscus,�� by Minfong Ho, a teenage girl fails a driving test but vows to take it again in the spring. The story was ended like this to show that the girl will have a new beginning. For example, ��When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again��(HO). The hibiscus is what makes her feel as though she is connected to her homeland. So if the hibiscus is budding it is starting a new beginning she feels that she will be able to do the same. This is why the story ends like that.        	2	2		2																					
1991	4	"These are a few reasons why the author concluded the story this way. The first reason is that most of the story is written in the way of a serious and stright forward tone and ending the story with a quote or riddle. Makes the reader have to think about the conclusion. It would be the same if he just  ended with what happened so he just added something that made you think a little more than a normal conclusion. The author ended the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and its hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it was different."	1	1		1																					
1992	4	Because she is going to practice and get better at driving and when the flower blooms she will go take the test agin. And she will try harder next time.	1	1		1																					
1993	4	The author includes that seterel paragraph because they wanted you to be able to visualize it in yor head rather than not seeing the picture. If you see a mental picture then it�s good at visualizeing.	0	0		0																					
1994	4	The author concludes with that because she means that she will try to go a whole season without thinking about home since she failed it in winter she will try agin in spring. Oho way you can tell this is by seeing that she is talking about how the plant is reminding her how life was befor they moved to the city. For example when she smelled the plant it almost seems to take her back in time to when she was little and they were growing wild and they were pretty.	1	1		1																					
1995	4	"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don�t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."	2	3		3																					
1996	4	The last paragraph of the �Winter Hibiscus� reads �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author ends with this statement to let the reader know that Saeng has hope and will continue to adjust to her new settling in the @LOCATION2 @CAPS1 the story, Saeng realizes that she is not as distant from her home in Vietnam as she believes. In the florists shops she sees �plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood worth. �The plants she grew up with exist in the @LOCATION2 as well. She fails �the test� by buying a winter hibiscus after breaking down crying, homesick. By the end of the story she recognizes that she is becoming more accustomed to her new life, which is �almost familiar to her now,� such as the geese flying overhead. The statement of the last paragraph means that by the spring, she hopes to no longer be homesick, and to think of the @LOCATION2 with its geese and winter hibiscuses as her home.	2	2		2																					
1997	4	The author ends the story that way to show Saeng's newfound determination. The whole story is about Saeng's journey one afternoon to come to acceptance with her new home, so it seems fitting to conclude with saeng's determination to pass her driving test and make life work in @LOCATION1. The story deals with several things Saeng finds that make her feel at home. �the sharp bitter melon and the hibiscus. These @CAPS1 lead Saeng to feel more at home and make it fitting to end with Saeng's acceptance that she will stay in @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 is also inspired by the hibiscus who is �strong enough to make it through the cold months that�s what matters.� This reads to Saeng's determination to make it through her new life. And finally, the geese Saeng recognizes that life in @LOCATION1 is becoming �familiar�. These geese lead @PERSON1 to the realization that this is her new home, and she can't go back. The whole story is filled with events like the three above that lead the @CAPS2 determination, so it�s fitting to conclude the story with her determination of it.   	3	3		3																					
1998	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that a new begining is starting  For example the fact that they moved to a different country. Thats what the author means when the spring comes. Spring represents a new life which is what Saeng & her mother are doing. Also the snow represents a blanked of the past / hard times. Last but not least when the hibiscus starts to bud that also means a new beganing. So if you put it all together you get the hard times going away when the snow melts & then a new beginning when spring starts & the flower buds  That is why the author put this paragraph in the story because they needed a fresh start.	2	2		2																					
1999	4	They author had conclued that sentence to be the coucluding sentence because saeng thinks she deserve another chance at taking the garden test because she has failed the test before  then having her mother to be disappointed in her. And to what Saeng say at the end of the story is that she's gonna have more confidence in doing the garden test again.	1	1		1																					
2000	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it is the end of  winter.	0	0		0																					
2001	4	The author probably ends the story like that because it creates a sense of hope and wonder. I feel the story is essentially about over coming things. For example, Saeng had a driving test and failed it. She also seemed a bit overwhelmed by the thought of �home�. Saeng obviously cares about failing the test or she wouldn�t have put any time into thinking about it, which led her to a green house. At the green house she was looking for a specific plant to buy, which reminded her of home. Thinking of home and her grandmother upsets her. Saeng has almost this internal war with her-self and the author ends the story that way to end the story giving the reader a sense of hope for Saeng and wonder.	3	3		3																					
2002	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows she's not going to just give up easily after failing once. This paragraph also shows that she's trying to like this country as much as she can and she is looking forward until spring time when the hibiscus is blooming, that will remind her of home, but also of her new life in @LOCATION1.	1	1		1																					
2003	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng failed to get a certain plant because it died but winter is over in spring is here it�s her chance to get that flower. For example in the story it says Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. It�s not her fault because in the story, it says the wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remarks of green and chicory weeds. The concludes because it will be a next time when you see Saeng again with a beautiful plant in her hand.	0	0		0																					
2004	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 the carter Saeng want to finish or @CAPS2 Take the Test agin when they come back and and also the author is @CAPS3 people @CAPS4't give up what you are doing with your self then she say that ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding Then I will take that test agin"" she means that she will not give up at all."	1	1		1																					
2005	4	The author ended the story with that sentence because in the spring Saeng is going retake the test and her hibiscus will finally be budding. Saeng is going to retake the test because she failed it the @CAPS1 time she took. That is why the author put that sentence at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2006	4	The author wrote this paragraph at the end of the story to symbolize a fresh start. I think this because when it is spring and the hibiscus is budding it will remind her homeland and she will take a fresh start at the test.	1	1		1																					
2007	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng has vowed to retake the test in the spring and will have more confidence when the snow melts, the geese return, and the hibiscus starts budding. �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eye now swept over her. � Saeng feels lonely because she is from a different country and misses everything she knew and loved. Now she has the hibiscus to remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
2008	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude her story to show that there was thought & a process gone through where she was learning & growing. At first SaenG is very uneasy & disappointed in herself. ""I-I  failed the test,"" saeng says. ""For a long moment MRS. Pan ouvong said nothing."" You can tell at first the mother is disappointed & then as they talk the are planting which eases the mood. ""How would you like an omelet w/ slices of the bitter melon? "" ""I�d love it,"" saeng said. Her mood has now lightened & she is thaking a calm, collective decision to try again which is a reasonable decision to make when she is in a good frame of mind rather than upset & distraught."	1	2		2																					
2009	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� it has an unusual ending. There are many reason why the author decided to end the story this way. First, the girl failed the test which made her go into silien, when he agreed to take the test over it is a sigh of the will to suvive, and it shows that she is trying at he goal until she got it. Finnaly the ending could represent a new beging like when the snow melts away and changes winter into spring. This is what the ending of �Winter Hibiscus� means and this is why the author concluded it this way.	1	1		1																					
2010	4	"The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: �I mean, not like the kind we had at-at-"".This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows taht Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude this story like he does."	2	2		2																					
2011	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because he was trying to tell us that hibiscus represents a comfort in a time of disappointment for Saeng. She saw the plant when she just fell her driving test. 	1	1		1																					
2012	4	Authors use conclusions to wrap up a story, or to make the reader think. In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author uses the conclusion �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� he uses this conclusion to show that she is going to adapt to this culture. For example, when she is in the garden shop she breaks down crying it says �and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and went� It is possible to reduce that she is crying because she uses to fit in here but because she didn�t pass her test she doesn�t think she will. So she motivates her self at the end of the story to try again. In conclusion, the author used that paragraph to show that Saeng will take the test again so she can fit into this new world.  	2	2		2																					
2013	4	Why the author concludes it because the author wants to show her that she won�t give up. that she will take the test again and try harder next time to overcome her challenge, and not give up. The author wants to show her, that she�s not a quitter, and she�s filled with determination even though she has conflicts.	1	1		1																					
2014	4	Why did the author conclude the story with this paragraph? I believe that the author concluded that paragraph because it tells what she is going to do in the future. For example in the story she told her mom �I failed�� When she was putting the flower in the hole by the garden a flock of geese were flying, heading south.	1	1		1																					
2015	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to try again. So when she said �Then I will take that tes again�, it means she knows she has another chance. It shows that she is strong willed and wont give up easy. So what she is saying in the last paragraph is if you don�t succed the first time try and try again. In the story it says �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season�. In that part I can tell that she is already starting to change. So I think next time she�ll do great.	1	2		2																					
2016	4	"I think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it shows determination to pass the test. The test was to be able to make the garden graw. You know this because it says �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This shows that the test she look had to do with spring and the budding of flowers and that she is trying to grow something. In this story, they mention her helping her mother in the garden. So I think when the plants didn�t grow, she wanted to try again. That�s why I think they chose to end with the statement saying about taking the test again in the spring."	1	2		2																					
2017	4	The author uses this paragraph because it brings back memories from when Saeng put down the soil during the �winter hibiscus� and a flock of Canada geese flew by her. When Saeng failed her test the first time she did not dare look at her mother. She depended on the hibiscus which helped or want to retake the test but not until they re-bud again.	1	1		1																					
2018	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to conclude all the things they talked about in the story. In the story they talk about the spring time and now Saeng and her mother plants flowers and everything.	0	0		0																					
2019	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph to show she won�t give up if they don�t. I think this because the birds and the hibiscus will only reapeer if they survive. That means they will stay strong in the meantime just like her. She will survive her new surrondings and change to fit into the styles of @CAPS1 life.	2	1		2																					
2020	4	 I think the author concludes the story the way hedid is becuse it will make people wownt to read the next story to see if the test is past it add suspenes to the story	1	1		1																					
2021	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because that represents saeng�s decision to try again and to overcome obstacles in her way. It is used instead of her saying � I will try again next spring � to show diction and to show her goal or decision in a different way for example, It says �, Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now.� At first, geese flying in the sky was new to her, but now she�s use to it. Maybe the author is making a reference to the geese since it will be familiar (the driving test) and she will pass like she got use to and familiar with geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, she�s been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph is saying simply that she�ll take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtones the point in the story, which is to not give up and the will to survive.	3	3		3

2023	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He was talking for bout ho beautiful was nutura. He also thought sense Saeng loved nutura a lot she was going to go back to school to finish the test when she could be home in the grarden taking care of the plant. That why I think the author dicide to finish with that paragraph it would probaly discribe how much he like nature. 	0	0		0																					
2024	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test.	3	3		3																					
2025	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because the symbolism of this paragraph tells that when every thing returns to normol and the �geese return and this hibiscus is budding that I will take that test again.� meaning she will be willing to move again and try to adapt.	1	1		1																					
2026	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about retaking the test to show that Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and even the smallest of things can hold memories for us. The paragraph shows Saeng is getting more used to @LOCATION2 by showing us that she isn�t going to give up on @LOCATION2 and that she will keep working at understanding our customs. The last paragraph also shows that our memories last forever by the hibiscus representing Vietnam and her home there. It also shows that she can start a new here just like the hibiscus does at her house. Finally the paragraph shows that even the smallest of things can hold our memories by the hibiscus representing her home in Vietnam. The hibiscus brings many memories back for Saeng and helps her cope with @LOCATION2. This is how the last paragraph shows us that Saeng is getting used to @LOCATION2, our memories last forever, and the smallest things can hold memories.	2	2		2																					
2027	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by @PERSON1, a teenage girl; Saeng, and her family, have moved to united states from Vietnam. Saeng is walking home after failing her driver's test, and she passes a familiar plant. She then goes into a florist shop to purchase the plant. She arrives home and tells her mother she failed the test of course her mother is upset, but she makes dinner and the plant the �winter hibiscus� at the end of the story Saeng thinks to herself, �when they come back, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� I think Saeng says she will retake the test in spring because she feels confident and happy now that she is comfortable with the plant she has, and her mother isn't too mad at her. She feels that everything is going to be ok and she can retake the test in spring, when life is blooming.	3	2		3																					
2028	4	The author concludes the story with this line because it shows that the geese was given the inspiration from the flower to come back, try again, and not give up. for example, Saeng vowed to herself that, �In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� This quote shows that the hibiscus was the reason for her determination. and that she would come back, just like they did. thats why the author decided to conclude the story with that line because she wanted to show Saeng being inspired, and not giving up.  	2	1		2																					
2029	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho I think the author ends with that paragraph because it shows that she is determined to pass. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.� This shows she is determined because geese migrate every year and flowers always bud every year. She will keep coming back just like the geese and the hibiscus do. She will be determined to pass the test and fit in sooner or later. If she was not determined she might never pass and fit into her new society.	2	2		2																					
2030	4	"I believe the author ends the story with this sentence to show how she overcome obstacles emotionally and how the hibiscus plant is a sigh of hope for future. In the beginning of the story, saeng is upset about failing her drivers test and then on top of that she gets upsets about seeing the native plants of her homeland. �In the story it says, �When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. And besides it was yet another friend, a small shrub� This quote shows how these plants remind her of her homeland, which she misses dearly and is very important to her. By bringing this plant back to her house, it's like she's bringing a little piece of her homeland. This quote:� �when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" shows that Saeng has hope in her life again in the form of this is a big turn of events in her life that will make her much happier in @LOCATION1 which is why she ended the story with this sentence.  "	3	3		3																					
2031	4	The author concludes the story like this because she is not ready to move on with her life. When everything turns back she will take that test and move on. But until her flowers are gone, she will not worry about school. For example she wrote �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. like geese.� This means that she has been use to change and has accepted the situation.	2	1		2																					
2032	4	I think the author concludes the Story with that statement becauses, the snow doesn�t melt in the spring geese don�t return in the winter and the hibiscus is not budding til spring either. The hibiscus is a beautiful plants Saeng loved this plant.    	0	0		0																					
2033	4	The whole story about Saeng buying the hibiscus is in response to her failing the driving test. This crushed her. She wants to be reminded of her old homeland where she did not read to past the driving lessons. So she goes to a green house to find plants that are similar to the ones she used to have in her homeland. She does this to try to make herself feel better but still �in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� Saeng feels she failed and the hibiscus gives her hope and memories of her old country. Her mom clearly sees and understands this when she doesn�t yell at Saeng for spending @NUM1$ on the plant. �I�m glad you got it,� Saeng�s mom says because she knows it comforts her daughter. Together the plant the hibiscus. By doing this they are planting Saeng�s hope to grow, not only to pass the driving test but to make it in the new country. *The story ends with those lines because Saeng decides if the hibiscus will grow then so will she. She will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she adapted. *The hibiscus, although it is not the one she had in the old country, she knows they can adapt to their surroundings and so the plant has in the new country. The plant will grow if it can adapt. Saeng can grow if she adapts to this new country.	3	3		3																					
2034	4	The author is trying to communicate that Saeng will never give up and her confidence will grow so she can retake her test like the hibiscus in the spring. Comparing Saeng to the hibiscus plant in the last paragraph was to show how she will grow and advance to take the test again when it�s the right time. The snow melting represents her sorrows going away as the sun shows how she will succeed and grow like the hibiscus plant she had bought. The plant growing in the sunlight would represent her confidence to take the test next time, getting rid of the cold brisk snow which is like her negative self esteem and attitude. The author chose to compare Saeng to the plant in the last paragraph to show how it related to her life and attitude, and how her life will change in result of the hibiscus plant.	2	2		2																					
2035	4	The author conludes her story with this paragraph because it really shows the heart and the perseveriance Saeng has. Also it tells a lot about her carter and ends the story in a strong mood. That is why she ended the story the way she did.	1	1		1																					
2036	4	When the snow melts & the geese return then mean its almost spring.	0	0		0																					
2037	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the auther felt like she would be ready for the new test. In the text it states that after walking home after failing liner driver test, she sees a familiar plant. later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased That she will take the test again because she feel as thought she is confident to past it the next time around.	1	1		1																					
2038	4	The author concludes this sentence in the conclusion because she wants to show the courage the girl has in immigrating to @LOCATION1. After having failed her drivers test Saeng was feeling deafeted and worthless. Her mother took into concideration and didn�t get mad at her for buying the flower. In fact she decided to plant the flower to show Saeng that everything would work out in the end. When Saeng began to see her mother doing this she became overwhelmed with determination and took over planting the flower for her mother. Immigrating to a new country is difficult and many immigrants face problems on a daily basis. Saeng�s mother was out in the cold planting and trying to make the best of her situation. By setting this example Saeng realized that she too could make the best out of her situation. This is why in the end Saeng decides to take her drivers test again, and ultimatly live with the same attitude her mother has.    	3	2		3																					
2039	4	They can compair the story and this statement to eachother because in the story the does not give up and the same thing with the test who even is taking to test again did not give up cause  they are taking it again.	1	1		1																					
2040	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph in hope. The conclusion the author made was to say in over that amount of time, Saeng will have overcome that failure and will be more prepared for the test for a second time. In the text, it says how Saeng realized that many of the things she thought of as strange before have become almost familiar which is an improvement.	1	1		1																					
2041	4	Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to show the change in saeng�s heart and attitude toward her new life in @LOCATION1 spring symbolize rebirth, the author doesn�t include this on accident. Spring will be saeng�s time of rebirth where she can take the test and restart her new life in @LOCATION1.�When the snow melts�is included because winter symbolizes death and when the snows melt a way so will saeng fears. 	2	2		2

2043	4	The author chose to conclude the last paragraph with the story to show that she has not given up. It shows that she has not given up because it says �overhead...geese...honk...familiar to Saeng now (second to last paragraph).� @CAPS1 when she buys the hibiscus, because, it holds many memories from home, to keep her going. Her mother still making an �omelet with slices of bitter melon� made her math water, @CAPS1 reminding her of home, gave her hope to not give up.	1	1		1																					
2044	4	Saeng love Flowers and plants. The Author concludes this paragraph in the stony because it go Along with the story. In the spring when the snow melts.Saeng waS waiting For winter to beover so she can see he plants and Flowers again. Saeng like the values of plants and enjoy planting them. The Author include that paragraph because he or she was showing how Saeng is so in love with plants. She couldn�t wait a new winter break was over.	0	0		0																					
2045	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng feels connected to the plant that reminds her of home. This connection is important because it shows how people can find ways to deal with changes in their lifes. Saeng does this by buying and planting the hibiscus plant so that she can see it and be reminded of home. She also buys the plant so that it motivates her to take the test she failed again in the spring when the flower is budding.	2	1		2																					
2046	4	because she is confused and is not yet youst to the country she is in how so she can concentrat on her test as soon as the flower will plown because she feels more like home she thinks that she will do better on the test	1	1		1																					
2047	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus makes her comfort, she says �when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. Since the author failed the test as it is told in the story, she will feel comfort taking the test again when the hibiscus come again after the snow season.   	1	1		1																					
2048	4	The author concludes the story by saying that when the geese come back in the spring then she will try to pass the test. So say that if at first you don�t sucede, try try again. Also the author concludes with that to show that Saeng has been in the @LOCATION2 for some years and that she still misses her home back in Vietnam.	1	1		1																					
2049	4	She thinks she is gonna pass the test because on spring becaus everything gets back on live againg flowers start growing again trees start to get green every thing starts to get Green the Geese are returning animals are starting to come out people go to the beach to distract their selve and that might be what she wan�t�s to do.	1	1		1																					
2050	4	The author most likely concludes this story with the quote because she has renewed hope. She was feeling really upset because she had failed the driving test and when she saw the hibiscus flower, she got even more emotional because she misses her home but when she sees the geese as she finishes planting the flower, she decides she�s going to try to retake the test next spring.	2	1		2																					
2051	4	The author concludes the story with, �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show Saeng growing up. As another year passes, Saeng will be more comfortable with her circumstances, and ready to start over fresh, just like all the plants will be blooming and budding. Failing her drivers test, really upset Saeng, so by waiting another year, she will be able to practice more, and become better, so that when she goes back and retests, she will be an even better driver, by having the time to practice, and start over. It�s almost like a new beginning for Saeng, another year has past, and new when her familiar plant budds, and begins to start over, so will she. Since the hibiscus plant is familiar to Saeng, she is better able to relate to it, and as it buds, and start fresh, so will Saeng. In conclusion, this is why the author concluded the story with that phrase.	2	3		3																					
2052	4	I think the author includes this paragraph  in  the  story  because  it  makes  sence  the  geese  come  back  home  after  the  snow  melts  and  saeng  try�s  to  take  her  test  again  around  that  time.	1	1		1																					
2053	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, author ends the story with �When they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show that Saeng is ready to adapt, but still needs time. Throughout the story, Saeng struggles with overcoming moving from her home, to an unfamiliar place hundreds of miles away. However, Saeng still isn�t ready to let go of her home yet. So she tries to hang on to her old memories, only to that in @LOCATION1, everything is different. When she buys a familiar plant to her, she realizes that even it is different in @LOCATION1, and gets angry that nit isn�t what she expected. However, at the end of the story she realizes that different isn�t always so bad, and vows to try to accept this new culture, but nows that it will still take a long time before she is ready to fully do so.	3	2		3																					
2054	4	The author concludes the story with that ending paragraph like that because when the spring comes back she going to try again. When I was reading this story it�s says in the story that her mother had asked her �What happened.� And the Saeng said �I- I failed the test�. So I am predicting that her mother is going to help her more with her studying and with her gardening. When the snow melts and Saeng vowed to herself that this time she work harder and past the test.	1	1		1																					
2055	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because that is when she will take the test again. Also because the geese made her realize, that many of the things that she had thought were strange before had become familiar. Just like the geese. It was through the quiet repitition of season upon season.	1	1		1																					
2056	4	She ends with that paragraph because it starts over. When the geese came back and the hibiscus is budding its like restart and she can try again, dealing with her memories of home and her adaption to the new country. I think she will be able deal with it better and take it again, it shows that she wont give up.	1	2		2																					
2057	4	She says that because she had failed to keep the tropical plant a live.She was disappointed in herself and so  that  why  she  said. In  the  spring, when  the  snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this hibiscus is budding, then  I  will take  that  tes t again. When  she  failed  and her mother said it will be okay you can always try again.	1	1		1																					
2058	4	I believe that why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she is telling the reader and herself In my point of view that once again she do work in the garden to see if it catches her interest. I believe that the author is trying to express this because in the beggining of the story the author shows no interest in the garden or any interest of the world around her. For example when she was supposed to buy just seeds for the garden she went and used some of her mother�s money to buy herself a big mac. So In conclusion I believe that what I wrote clearly states how the author feels and why she ended they story the way she did.	1	1		1																					
2059	4	"The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the show melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because Saeng failed the test before and now she wants to pass the test. She learned a lot from her mother that day that completely changed her attitude towards life."	1	1		1																					
2060	4	The author might of concluded the story with that sentence to show that she still cares about the test and not mostly about a meisly plant thats gonna die anyways. Also because she needs to pass the test and the author is putting in a getall that in the end the girl is gonna pass and not have to re-take that test all over again. but also he/she tells that because he/she wants us to know that it aint all about other things that are expensive in life but that school is really more important than anything basically.	1	1		1																					
2061	4	The reason why the author, Minfong Ho, finished the story �Winter Hibiscus� on with the last paragraph  was due to in the story the girl went out on a test. And on this test which I do not know what the test is, she failed it and returns with a saebba hedge. This is a tamed plant for the family. The family loves this plant. They are what I understand from the story, newcomers to a country. And the country is @LOCATION1. They�ve moved here from Vietnam. She goes for her driving test and comes home failed. One of the things her mother asks, �why do you spend so much money on this beautiful plant when you could a had the famed bee-maags� which is the mother�s attempt to say a Big Mac which is their favorite fast food sandwich. But the reason why the daughter comes back with the plant is she has failed her parents on the driving test. She wants to go back and try again. �Then the snow will melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will return to take the test again.� She believes the next time she goes, she will pass the test and that she will not be ashamed of it and that she will make her parents proud by passing the test due to it is a high honor to the family, I believe, from what I am getting from this. In Vietnam not many people drive and that they want their daughter to earn this and it is something they do not have.	2	2		2																					
2062	4	It is clear that Saeng is in the midst of struggle during a time of homesickness after recently moving from Vietnam. But as time goes on she will learn to balance the affection she feels for both her new country and homeland. As Saeng moves through the story it is apparent that she longs for memories of her homeland, but is beginning to find new things to enjoy about her new home. For example, while she is touched by the memories aroused by the hibiscus flower, she is intrigued by the new experiences, such as eating Big @CAPS1 and new friends. While homesickness has caused her to struggle she knows that with time she will be able to overcome the obstacle of leaving the old ways, for the new without completely obliterating either. She is convinced that by spring she will be able to overcome this obstacle and have the confidence to pursue any that will arise in her future.    	3	3		3																					
2063	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng�s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. 	1	1		1																					
2064	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to say whenever something leaves their home they always come back. The hibiscus reminds her of home and that is where she wants to go. Saeng had failed her drivers test and she said when the geese come back I will do it again. The plant reminds her of home but its, �Not like the tird we had before� (Ho). She is trying to say that the ones over at Vietnam are better and she wants to go back because she misses it.	1	1		1																					
2065	4	"Saeng is talking about flowers coming back in the spring time. She is vowing to take the test again after the snow is gone and she is going to do it agin. �The wind was blowing harder, tearing of the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing."" So she cant wait until it is spring agin. So she can try to plant agin."	0	0		0																					
2066	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is saying when everything comes beet to the way they were she will do everything agein so thins aren�t the same as they used to be and she wants them to.	0	0		0																					
2067	4	The girl, Saeng , seems to be attached to nature and enjoy it when the spring comes like she said, a new natural intenill start and she will be motivated to take the test that she failed again. The author most likely finished with this paragraph to show that there will be hope for Saeng and she will do what she has to do to have comfortably in her new home country. The whole story talks about how she is still unsatisfied with her new home but it would be cut to and the stay with new chances and a new life, which they did using springtime to show this.	2	1		2																					
2068	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved i didn�t like it because I didn�t have many friend but in like a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friend. This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2069	4	In the story �winter Hibiscus,� the author included important part at the end that saeng vowed. The reason why she said that is because when everything in her life starts up again she will love her life again, she will be alot happier person.	1	1		1																					
2070	4	The author in @LOCATION1 this because it is shows what is is going to do to he her gain failed and this story a what she must do get just from the geese	0	0		0																					
2071	4	I believe that the author chose to end with that paragraph because the paragraph represents new beginnings and starting over. When Saeng fails her driving test she has a moment of weakness, she feels lonely and then she sees a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam. In a since, the plant comforts her. �it�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here� In this quote Saeng�s mother tells her that the flower is too, out of place but yet has found the courage and determination to still grow. In the closing paragraph Saeng decides that, like the flower and the birds, she can also find the coarge to face fears. She deciedes to retake the tests.	2	2		2																					
2072	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� The Author concludes with this paragraph to show that she�s not going to give up and to show her mom that too.	1	1		1																					
2073	4	I belive the author was saying a new start. I say this because of everything coming back. I also say it because Saeng knows whats important now and will take it seriously. That is what I think the author was saying at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2074	4	During  �Winter  Hibiscus�  written  by  Minfong  Ho, a young  girl  and  her  mother   to  a new place,and the  daughter  Saeng  is  having a hard time.Saeng found a plant called dok faeng-noi that reminds her of home. So  she bought it and took it home to show her mom, At first her mother was upset, she bought a @NUM1 dollar plant but then hearing her daughter is disappointment in herself, she found joy in the beautiful plant, while Saeng�s mother was cooking dinner .Saeng planted the beautiful plant and told herself when the  geese return, hibiscus is budding and its spring she will retake the test. She found strength in herself and  courage  to  do  better.  I think the author wanted to show how she gained respect for herself in the end of the passage. That is why the author ended it like she did.   	1	2		2																					
2075	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is what the whole story is about. It is about how Saeng misses home and filed the test when she bought the hibiscus. Saeng failed the test because she bought the hibiscus. She let herself by the flower and remember her home. That make her sad. In that last paragraph she is saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will be used to the new country and home, and will not fail the test. If she is tempted by something from home, she will not take it because it will make her sad. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is the main idea of the story. It shows her getting used to the new home	2	1		2																					
2076	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� written by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to sum it at all up. The author used this to keep the reader wondering too.	1	1		1																					
2077	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they come back, saeng vowed Silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, to show that even though she failed her test she isn�t giving up and that she will persevere over this and continue to try. This ending shows the determination in Saeng�s heart. Saeng has enough determination inside of her to go on even though she failed her test and failed her grandmother to continue trying and continue to try to complete for her grandmother and herself. I really liked this ending and I am glad that the author decided to use this ending in the story.	1	1		1																					
2078	4	Having failed the drivers test really upset Saeng. Not only that but she had to moved to a new country and the loss of her grandmother really made thing worse. The Hibiscus plant in this story, is like a symbol. It represents her life and reminds her of one in Vietnam. The way memorys come to her as she sees these flowers shows how she felt. It was all about starting new and overcoming obstacles. When she says, �� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� it shows her starting new again and making it through the rough times, symbolized by winter. It was a symbol of herself and the hardship she will overcome. 	2	2		2																					
2079	4	In the story the author concludes the story in his last paragraph because he showes that even in her hardships. Saeng goes on and keeps trying to live a normal life after she had to move. For example when it says, �Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring I will take the test again.� This shows that even after one failuare you should never give up but don`t forget the past.	1	1		1																					
2080	4	The author of the story �winter Hibiscus�, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author wrote, �When they come back�in the spring� then I will take that test again�.(No). Saeng thought to herself and meant that she would move on in the spring. It also shows that Saeng could overcome failing the test. The narrative also states,��in the spring�when�this hibiscus is budding��(No). The season of spring means to symbolically start new and fresh. When the flower is budding, it is beginning a new life. Saeng is also starting fresh when she decides that she will take the test in the spring. Finally, this shows that Saeng could adopt to her new life by purchasing a familiar plant. The hibiscus helped her get through disappointing times. The geese also were a reminder that some things back home were the same. Minfong Ho concluded the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's adaptations. 	2	3		3																					
2081	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants to tell people that shes going to take the test again and try. Shes going to be like the flowers but she needs time so when they budd she will.	1	1		1																					
2082	4	In the story �winter hibiscus �by @CAPS1 Ho the storey ends with Saeng promising herself that she will take the test again in the spring. The author most likely ends this way because it shows how Saeng is getting over her sorrow test in the spring when the Hibiscus is in @LOCATION1. This is shown when Saeng says �I-I failed the test (@NUM1) this shows @CAPS2 leaving her homeland and makes her even more so sad, but she then promises herself that in the spring when flowers @LOCATION1 she will try again. She does this when she says to herself ��in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�(pg @NUM2) this shows her getting over her sorrow and becoming determined and looking forward and taking the test again.	2	2		2																					
2083	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts when the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again�. The author does this to show how Saeng was able to slowly adjust to change while not forgetting where she came from. This is shown by using symbols of geese and hibiscus together. The geese represent the new home and sounds Saeng had to become adjusted to. While the hibiscus represents the old memories of her past and homeland. Putting the symbols together shows she has come to accept both places. By @CAPS1 that she�ll take the test again in the spring shows how she will be ready for the change because the test represents how she feels abut @LOCATION1 and by passing the test she allows herself to pass with @LOCATION1 and adjust to the change in her life.	3	3		3																					
2084	4	They used this sentence because she wants to see the flower bud and feels like she is at home again. Then she will take the test. She also will feel lucky and have a memory of home so saeng vowed silently to herself.	1	1		1																					
2085	4	 The author concludes the story with the sentence, ��when they come back  Saeng  vowed silently to her self in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again��.

Saeng had a hard time trying to overcome these events and others. so I think this sentence was put at the end so the readers could see that see was going  to be ok, and overcome everything that happened know we know this special plant will help Saeng will future problems.     	2	2		2																					
2086	4	After reading the about story, �Winter Hibiscus � by Minfong Ho, I believe the quote, �when they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus the budding, then  I will take that test again.� Was put in the story for a reason. I believe that this quote concluded the story because it ashamed a tone and feeling of hope. For example, in the story it state that �Saeng day out a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it�. This shows that this plant areas a lot to here. The story tell the readon that it things lack memories of her grandmother. It represents hope to Saeng because it always brings back happy memories she once had which push here to try to overcome the loss betters. Therefore, the quote concludes the story because it about Saeng will for hope and peace. It represent that when the plant blooms in the spring she will have a new found sense of hope and happiness.	2	2		2																					
2087	4	�Winter Hibiscus�, by Minfong Ho is a story about transition to @LOCATION1 and her own ability to be strong. Saeng failed her drivers test and was dissapointed as she walked home. She stops at a florist shop because she see's a plant that she thinks is like the one she had back home. Seeing this plant again makes her remember memories from her homeland. She plants it when she gets home and vows to take a driving test again. When the geese get back. The plant is like encouragment to her.	2	2		2																					
2088	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the story was about her getting accustomed to things being repeated in nature, so she added the last paragraph saying that when everything happens again she will do the same. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2089	4	I think the athor includes that becaus. she mite have faeled and need more time to study to get thing @NUM1 so other than that damn new	0	0		0																					
2090	4	The author uses this sentence to conclude the story to show that Saeng�s hope is restored. Throughout the story Saeng is sad and misses her home. She feels hopeless in this new land, the hibiscus reminds her of home and brings back memories of her being at home with her grandmother, which makes her want to be back at home. The author adds the part about the geese leaving because they also have to leave their home. The hibiscus is to symbolize her being strong and that she will make it through moving to just strange land.	2	2		2																					
2091	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng won�t give up & will keep trying. In the story all the memories of her old country encouraged her to be strong. For example the flower made her sad but in the end it made her better. Also in the beginning she didn�t really like new changes and she missed home, but at the end some of the same memories she had back home were in her new country. Those are the reasons I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph	2	2		2																					
2092	4	In the story �winter hibiscus� by Minfong Ho I believe that the author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that if the Hibiscus plant has enough strength to come back and flourish than she has enough strength to come back and take the test again. For example, in the story it says �but its strong enough to make it through the cold months.� This quote shows that the hibiscus plant is strong. And Saeng sees that as if the plant is strong enough to return after a cold winter than she can return to the test after failing. Overall, I think that both Saeng and the hibiscus plants are very strong.	2	2		2																					
2093	4	In this story it is about how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are similar when it comes to adapting to their surrounding and how her and the plant will keep continuing just like Saeng with her �test�. But I know this because its says �Then I will take that test again� her saying that is her saying she will thrive again just like the hibiscus plant. So in conclusion she really is much like the plant and will continue for many seasons to come and also adapt to the changes just like the hibiscus. 	2	2		2																					
2094	4	The author ended the story with the last paragraph because spring time comes and geese return, shell feel better about herself so she can go and take the test again and focus more on the test .	1	1		1																					
2095	4	In the story �winter Hibiscus� by @CAPS1 Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it goes along with the story. In the story Saeng went to look for the pant that reminded her of her grandma. She found the plant and then she thought of her grandma and she cried. I think she was testing herself to see if she had gone on with her life but she failed. So I think she bought the plant so she can try again when the plant is in bloom.	1	1		1																					
2096	4	He want to learn hibiscus spirits. Don't be afraid of fare. You just keep ahead, continuly to learn what you want, then you will success. like hibiscus has strong alive: fight with evironment. So, the author use this paragraph to conclude, the purpose is the Saeng will take this test again, like hibiscus will budding when spring's come	1	1		1																					
2097	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, the hibiscus is budding. she will take the test. I think that the author conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to test them again.	0	0		0																					
2098	4	The author ended that story like that because that�s  how she started the story.The little girl was looking at the flowers and plants in the the beginning ,so the author thought that it would be a good thing to end the story like it was started.Also because the friendship that Saeng has with the plants and flowers will come back again in the spring when everything is blooming and looking very beautiful.It shows that the plants give a sense of comfort when she is going through hard times.That is why the author concludes with Saeng and the plants.	1	1		1																					
2099	4	"In @CAPS1 Ho�s �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese �slowly fading into the distance� she thought of herself. �When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. �the geese return and this hibiscus is budding� means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person. �This hibiscus is budding� states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take that test again� because it�s a new start for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will saeng."	2	2		2																					
2100	4	Saeng vowed to herself that when the hibiscus begins to bud again she will take the test again. The hibiscus symbolizes hope to saeng that things can work out a second try. She concludes the story with the vow because, it expresses her last bit of hope. For example, the hibiscus has comforted her in a new country, with new surroundings but it also explains how she feels. She vows to show she won't give up despite of falling the first time. For example, �Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense , it was almost visceral �(Ho). This quote explains what the plant meant to her. This is why she concluded the story with a vow.  	2	2		2																					
2101	4	 The author ends the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s resolution. Her family had left a lot behind in Vietnam. She had the memory of her grandmother and hibiscus. edge. In the @LOCATION2 they are struggling as implied by the mothers reaction at the cost. The hibiscus she bought was away to comfort her. She thinks that if the plant can put up with the harsh winter environment she can do despite the differences in the @LOCATION2 and passing the drivers exam is something that many do and is a way to get used to her surroundings / fit in.	2	2		2																					
2102	4	The author concludes the story with this sentence because it shows the girl the is willing to overcome obstacles and although she @MONTH1 have failed once she will keep trying, It also shows a connection between the geese and the hibiscus and the girl wanting to overcome her obstacles. Also the girl wants to overcome her obstacle at a certain time.	2	1		2																					
2103	4	In the last paragraph when she siad she was going to have the test again, but in the spring when all the snow melts and the hibiscus budd's. She says that because, that is her favorit time of the year. So she will feel more confident that time. For example when she talks about the manigascar hibiscus that grows through bricks she loves hibiscuses. So she wants to take the test when she feels the best. 	1	1		1																					
2104	4	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph to let readers known that Saeng is a survivor just like hibiscus. Saeng has not quite adapted to america and feels that this plant reminds her of home	1	1		1																					
2105	4	The author finishes it with this because spring time is a new beginning. Since Saeng failed the test she wants to start over in the spring like the flowers do. To know that the hibiscus will grow back though now it is dying. For spring to come is a time to start a new, where babies are born, flowers are at blom and a new beggening is forming	1	1		1																					
2106	4	The concludes the sentence this way because their trying to show that Saeng is a very deterimined girl and no matter how many times she fails, she always trys again and again tell she gets it right. By doing this the author is showing what Saeng believes in and that is no matter how big or hard the chanellge is she will keep on going tell she is done what she started. Because moving was a very hard for her. She had a very hard time communicating with peolpe and just tyring to make friends cause it is not always easy be new, by moving she took a another look at things because they were different on her. But as time went by she got the hang of it so as long as you try you can be successful in it that�s what the author was trying to say by concluding it the way it was.	2	2		2																					
2107	4	In the story a young girl named saeng takes a test but she had falled. She is going to retake it next spring, thats why the last paragraph say; when then come Back, Saeng vowed  silently to herself, in the spring mum the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then l will take the test again the author concludes the story with this ending @CAPS1 in the story it talks about the hibiscus flowers so, since she failed the test instand  of saying she will retake it next spring they say when the hibiscus flowers bud @CAPS1 at that time it will be spring.	1	1		1																					
2108	4	The author concludes the story like that to let the readers know that the daughter saeng would come back and take the test again, she loves the Garden sotherefore she will not forget what spring did for her.	1	1		1																					
2109	4	It shows that she loves her plants. The story tells you all of the plants and how she likes them. She thinks they are all unique and that she enjoys the plants more than school or anything else.	0	0		0																					
2110	4	"Minfong who concludes "" Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph because it show @CAPS1's determination to succed in her new country despite the obstacles she faces. The winter hibiscus reminds Saeng to be strong like the hibiscus in is to endure winter or in Saeng's case to pass the driving test the text states ""....but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus ....""(Ho @NUM1). Saeng realizes she must also be ""strong"" lkie the ""winter hibiscus"" Saeng also realizes that she is beginning to adopt to the new country he wrote ""Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had though strange before had become almost familiar...""(Ho @NUM1).Saeng knows that she is able to adopt and is determined to succeed. Tthe author conclude.""..in the spring, the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" (Ho @NUM1) The ""spring "" will be Saeng's"	2	3		3																					
2111	4	"In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, by Minfong Ho the aurthe concluldes the story with the last paragraph because he's trying to say when the flower comes back to life and starts a new beginning that Saeng will start a new beginning by retaking the test. For example, �Look how root - bound it is, poor thing"". The example is saying how the plant was almost died when she bought it. Another example would be, ""I-I failed the test"". The example tells how she feels down about failing the test. So In @CAPS1 the flower was at it's �breaking point"" as well as saeng. The paragraph tells how @CAPS2 was going to take a break and wait for the flower to being stronger till she toke the test again."	1	2		2																					
2112	4	The author added the last paragraph because Saeng�s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better.	2	2		2																					
2113	4	The author concludes the story with this sentence because the girl saeng wanted to take the test again, but also wanted her habiscus to stay strong and to keep growing. So she said I will take the test again when my habiscus starts to bloom again.	1	1		1																					
2114	4	"Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho explores one's quest for acceptance and adaptation to changes in life. Saeng is  the young in the story who is dealing with her recent move to america from her homeland in asia. after failing a test, Saeng spends an dosene amount of money on a flower. When she consoltes with her mother, Saeng silently vows something to herself. Saeng vows ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". @CAPS1 Ho chose to end the story this way because the story represents the guest for adaptation. Single-handedly, Saeng was able to say a vow to herself that showed she had accepted her new foreign home of america, even though she will always remember her homeland."	2	2		2																					
2115	4	The author concludes this paragraph in the article because is the ron faldse in love with the plant and uses for a clock to tell her when she can take the test. It your not a @CAPS1.S citizen you can only take the driver�s test once a year.	1	1		1																					
2116	4	The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says �Saeng vowed silently to herself �which means she wants what is best for herself.	1	1		1																					
2117	4	Saeng believes that because she failed the driving test that she won�t be able the transition by a new country had she goes searching for her past. She finds her past in plants remembering Vietnam in deep sorrow. The narration states  �A were of less so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eye��(No) She remembers and misses everything she had she wanted her country her grandmother and her life. She came home to her mother with a plant and disappoint her mother with the cost but she understands the pain. The narration states �it�s a beautiful plant she finally said in sad you got it�(No). Eventually Saeng realizes how this plant affected her and how easily it survived and made a promise to herself. The narration states �and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agin   	2	3		3																					
2118	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus.� The author ends the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. To show or emphasize that if the hibiscus, a plant reminding her of her home, can over then so can she. In the story after the author had failed her driving test and was walking back home, seeing the flowers reminded her of home & connected her to her past making her felt less alone. For example, when the author says A wave of loss so deep & strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.� That shows that she misses her home and the flower gave her a way to move deeply connect to her memories, also when she says �like the geese the distinctive V against the sky.� That shows that the geese were kind of like her they were moving to a different place to start a new. Making her feel that if they can adapt and change so will she over time In conclusion the ending was to futher emphasize her feeling towards her hometown and the new town she lives in.	3	2		3																					
2119	4	The author ends the story like this in comparing to adapting changing or doing everything all over again for example; The geese fly  away when it gets cold but they always  come back giving their home another  chance .The Hibiscus is another  fine example , it buds  in  @DATE1  always  but  doesn�t  die  in  winter.  It always  returns . Saeng  has obviously realized  this  and vowed to  try her  drivers  test  again because it might work  this time . The author was trying to get the message spread of ,� don�t  give  up.�	1	2		2																					
2120	4	Determination, help, strength � all are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with the paragraph. First, determination is a @CAPS1 why Saeng will go back and take the test again. Saeng failed her drivers test the frst time and she wants to wait and do it again. Shes determinated to take different steps in order to pass the test. Secondly, I beleieve that help is a @CAPS1 why the author concluded with that paragraph. Saeng will need help in order to pass the test and she beleives that the hibiscus plant will help her pass and help her to do other things. The author is proving that she�ll go back and she�ll be ready. Finally, strength is the last @CAPS1 why the author chose the paragraph to end the story. Saeng beleieves that the hibiscus plant will give her the strength to pass the test. The author left off with the paragraph to show she will go back and she�ll be stranger than she was before. These are reasons why I beleieve the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	3	2		3																					
2121	4	"Mingfong Ho concludes �Winter Hibiscus� with the paragraph,�when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending paragraph shows that Saeng will not give up in her struggle to adapt in this new place. Saeng has been going throug hard times; moving to the United States and failing her driver�s test. In the greenhouse Saeng even breaks down and crys. The hibiscus flower that saeng bought cost the family a lot of money, but to Saeng it was very important. This flower represented hope. When the flower buds again it would be the right time to take her driver�s test. The flower also represents adapting to a new place. As Saeng  adapts to the United States, the hibiscus adapts to the new garden. "	2	3		3																					
2122	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng changed. Saeng didn�t want to take the test and she had no confidence. In the story saengs mother supports her no matter what. She even understood when Saeng bought a plant for @MONEY1 because it reminded her of home. Now that Saeng has been comforted she feels more relaxed and she is ready and more confident to take the test again. therefore Saeng has changed.	2	2		2																					
2123	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to  herself , in the spring. When the snows melt and the geese situation and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. �The   author chose this to end   the story to show that you need to keep faith in your heart. Saeng   was still a bit homesick throughout the story. That could have possibly impacted how she did on her driving test. If one   waited a season or two, her homesickness would most likely drift away and she would be able to focus on meeting her goal. Missing her grandmother and her home in Vietnam must have taken a huge tell on her if it had anything to do with why she failed her driving test. Another reason the author could be that he wanted to lighten the mood up a little bit. Saeng breaking down in the greenhouse had a very melancholy feeling to it, and her vowing to herself that she would take the test over once spring come around kind of lifted your hopes up for her.	3	3		3																					
2124	4	The Author concludes this story with that paragraph because she is saying that she could not concentrate on the test because she wanted to go back to her home country.	1	1		1																					
2125	4	The author probally ended with this to show the feeling that Saeng will return and help out again. So Saeng must like to plant. She probaly might hep his mom with alot more things now that she can see what helping might lead too.   	0	0		0																					
2126	4	In the story ��Winter Hibiscus,�� the author ends the story with Saeng �s thoughts. The thought of trying the test when the hibiscus starts budding ties the story together. The story is mainly about how she looks for a flower and the memories it brings. But she wouldn�t have gone to the shop if she passed the test. This creates a full understanding of the test and hibiscus. It also shows the importance of the hibiscus. Both Saeng and the flower must adapt to survive and are out of place. Saeng was from Vietnam and the flower was from a shop, both were moved from where they belong to a new place.In some ways Saeng is the flower. She must adapt to her home to survive. The flower, outside in the cold, must adapt to its surroundings in order to survive. When she knows the flower survived the harsh winter, she will realize that she can survive living in @LOCATION2. This would make her feel strong and focused. 	3	2		3																					
2127	4	In in Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho, the last paragraph is a vow by the main character (Saeng) to retake her driver�s test when spring comes and her hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of hope to the sad story. It suggests that Saeng will be okay and will move past her longing for the country of her birth. �And in the war on moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. �Saeng was so sad and miserable. All of the flowers reminded her home country. She was depressed and homesick. When she got home, she planted a hibiscus plant in the frozen ground when it would bloom in the spring it would represent a new life and another chance. It meant that Saeng would not give up. Minfong Ho concluded Winter Hibiscus on a positive note with the last paragraph.	2	3		3																					
2128	4	Why the counclude the story saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will will take that test again is to leave suspense. But he mean that saeng ate all the plant so next year she will have the test not to eat it. This is why the author ended the story with that.	1	1		1																					
2129	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Forexample, It gives the Story a good and happe ending.	1	1		1																					
2130	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants the reader to feel like she is going to accomplish something because of the hibiscus and the geese. An example of her accomplishing something because of hibiscus is when the author mentions how her and her grandmother use to spend time together and do things together and her grandmother would do her hair and then put a hibiscus flower into it. Also the geese are a sing of accomplishment because she sees them in the sky flying south so they can survive the cold winter months in a warm place.	1	1		1																					
2131	4	The reason why he concludes this with this paragraph is because he is telling how the story ends. The reason behind that is so people know's what happens.	0	0		0																					
2132	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to end the story on an optimistic note. Saeng�s problem is her �wave of loss� that sweeps over her during her memories of her home country. This entire story deals with Saeng�s depressing struggle with finding joy in her life in a new, unfamiliar and seemingly unwelcoming country. This feeling of loss and loneliness is magnified by the test then Saeng failed. After a story of such depression, the author shows @CAPS1 newly found confidence and optimism by ending the story with this paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2133	4	She concludes the story with this paragraph because she want to let the readers of the story that she is not willing to give up and and that she is willing to take the test again and pass it.	1	1		1																					
2134	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she adapted her  new home. Also, it concludes the story so it shows the leader her last thoughts. So its like its, the  last thing , and subject  that  you  that  you  think  the author  concludes  the  story with  this  paragraph ,� when  they  come  back , in the spring , when the snows melt and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus is budding , then  I  will  take that  test  again.�	1	1		1																					
2135	4	They author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want to see what people would say.	0	0		0																					
2136	4	This saying is saying that the snow has already fallen down onto their garden and when the snow melts, they will have to recrop everything again. This is a perfect conclusion to end this story. The story is talking about how the flowers grow in the spring and how saeng�s mom grows fruits and veggies in her garden. So since it snowed and their would be a while before the spring come back. Saeng has alot of planning to do in the next spring. The hibiscus will be budding and the geese will return.	0	0		0																					
2137	4	In the story I think the author concludes  that  paragraph  with  the  story  because  Saeng  is  saying  that  when  she  comes  back  or when  she next  sees  the  hibiscus  bloom  again  she  will  then  take  the  test  but  until then  she  feels  out  of  place  and  she  is no use to the  arrangements  she is living in  now  and  she  feels  uncomforatable  but  until  then  she  thinks  that she will not  be able  to do  will  until  she  is in  her  bloms  tow  a  where  it  is  horman   for  her.	2	1		2																					
2138	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because show that she will go back to the one place and will not break down like that and grif over what she has lost and have to deal with change.	1	1		1																					
2139	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when it snows plants die and won�t grow back until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will she how her garden will be in the spring. Therefore the author put this paragraph in the end because Saeng loves gardening so much ever since she moved to the United States. Ever since the family moved to the United States the family has never been happier for being together having dinner and planting together they had the time of there life planting all the time.	1	1		1																					
2140	4	If you have ever had to move from your home town or country, you how comforting something can be that�s from your old country and in your knew one. The fact that Saeng had geese and plants and everything else comforted her enough to know that next spring she can take the test. Throughout the story it seemed as if everything that Saeng ever saw that she had in her home country of Vietnam in some way warmed and comforted her. Early in the story it illustrates her feelings as she makes her way through the green house Many times in the story you could always �hear� that sense of love when she would call plant by its native languages name. Throughout the story you could always sense the love and caring she had. The author knows how she loves those things and that they would encourage her. Therefore that�s why he concluded the story as such. 	2	2		2																					
2141	4	The author concludes this paragraph with the story because of the potintal of the hibiscus. So Saeng will go take the test again no matter she already took it and failed. She is like the hibiscuc. The hibiscus seems out of place and is determined to survive when the snow melts. So she will go take the test again and us the hibiscus as her modifation.	2	1		2																					
2142	4	The author had concluded the story with the paragraph When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because the author wanted the reader to notice how the mother and the child bond with gardening. Between the different things that author has said about Saeng and Saeng�s mother. He as in the author shows a way they have bonded they being Saeng and Saeng�s mother which I think it was fairly neat they way the author had bid out this story. It was a fairly interesting story to it kept you guessing, on the end of year seat, wondering. But I enjoyed reading that story. I had also liked how the daughter and mother were so great friends. But it was a nice thing to see with the daughter and the mother being so in touch with each other. Also, in doing this the author has shown some of his ways of thinking. The author shows us he a great mind and a good way thinking. This author is telling us a great story of a girl and her mother it sounded very good to me. This story is a gardening story of a daughter and her mom moving from Vietnam and moving to the @ORGANIZATION1 to live out the rest of their lives.	1	1		1																					
2143	4	There could be many reasons the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It could be because Saeng wants to pass the test now to make her mother happy. It could also be because she will need to be able to drive in the next year for some reason. Maybe it�s because it cost her money to keep taking it. She really likes her hibiscus though.	1	1		1																					
2144	4	The author concludes the story in this way to show that Saeng is a determined undividual. It is symbolic for when the geese return she will take the test again because when they left she had failed. The snow melting and the hibiscus budding show spring and spring is usually the start of a fresh and new begininig. The last paragraph its like a symbol for starting fresh. Saeng was upset about failing the test �She said, �I�I failed the test.� By stuttering that shows she was upset. Since she was upset giving it time until she takes the test again is good. The author ended the story with this paragraph to show Saeng is strong and will have a fresh and new start.	2	2		2																					
2145	4	I feel the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that Saeng found some sense of relief with the flower. It also show that Saeng wasnt going to give up and she was going to keep trying. At first she was sad and upset but when she saw the flower that reminded her of home, she became happy and didn�t feel so bad about failing the test. The flower had a deep impact on her cause it reminded of home and when she started thinking about her grandmother she became a little sad, but then she thought about the flower and how much it meant to her, she felt comfort from the flower. I feel the concludes the story in good positive way.	2	1		2																					
2146	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to leave us with hope. Saeng is going to retake the test she failed. Saeng is having a hard time adjusting to her new life, by waiting until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, Saeng gives herself time to adapt and heal. The paragraph show�s Saeng�s courage and hope about retaking the test.	1	1		1																					
2147	4	Honestly I'm not quite sure. Maybe because she fees assured now. Maybe its a mental trial we all must face. Maybe the geese returning and the plant budding is a metaphoric test too.	1	1		1																					
2148	4	The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved	2	2		2																					
2149	4	The concludes the story way because that the way he want for the gril to end it. Cause she all about them flowers, plant, animals. She likes Madagascar periwinhle. The places went she use to live is gorse with plants, animals, flowers.	0	0		0																					
2150	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the author concluded the story with a paragraph that showed feeling. The paragraph showed that the girl Saeng was determined to pass the test, For example the text states �the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again�. It shows that even though she failed it once she isn�t going to let that stop her. The girl also expresses somewhat how she feels about the geese and the plant. For example the text states �when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. It shows that she doesn�t regret buying the hibiscus.  	1	2		2																					
2151	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus � this way because she is  creating a sense of hope that Saeng feels for the future. Saeng  was feeling very sad when she was walking home from failing her drivers test. The author describes this scene as �The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds.� The winter and cold represent Saeng losing hope. When she gets home and shows her mother the hibiscus, her mother says that it is �strong enough to make it through the cold months here�. This symbolizes Saeng making it through as well. At the end of the story, Saeng  sees geese and realizes that �many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the qunet  repition of season upon season, almost familiar to her�. This shows that she really is adjusting to her new home, and has hope for when spring comes, and the geese return, and hibiscus bloom.	3	3		3																					
2152	4	She wanted to catch them, that was her whole goal and purpose of hunting.  Trying to catch geese. She saw her grandparents try to do it. In conclusion this is why she made that last statement.	0	0		0																					
2153	4	The author concluded the story will this paragraph because she wants the readers to understand that she didn�t give up on the plant and that she�s determine. For example the story state that Saeng said �I-I failed the test,� She felt as though she didn�t accomplish what she wanted to. So at the end of the story she said �I will take that test again.� To show what kind of person she is and she not going to just give up just because she failed the first time.	2	1		2																					
2154	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring time everything is reborn and in the spring time Saeng will be used to her surroundings. One example of this is when the author states ""she relazed that many of the things that she had thought of as strange befor had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost fimilar to her now. This means that with every season she get more used to her new home and if became more like her and with every season. Another is when the author say�s she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading to the distance.� This reminds her of her old home watching the geese."	2	2		2																					
2155	4	In the story, Saeng is being forced to adapt to an abrupt change when her family moves from vietnam to the United States. The story tells of how different things in the @LOCATION3 spark a memory of her life back in Vietnam. The second to last paragraph talks about the hibiscus, and the geese and the change of seasons. The last paragraph sums all that up, and how when everything farmiliar to her in Vietnam is being symbolized in the @LOCATION3, she will continue to try driving, and, ultimately, adapt to the changes the @LOCATION3 has brought her. This shows that Saeng can overcome her obstacles of the country, and is determined to do so. This paragraph is placed at the conclusion of the story because it reflects the theme of change and adaption throughout the story, but mostly reflection. The author takes time to explain how each individual item in the story reminds saeng of her old home, and in an effort to raise the tone of the story from regret and sadness to hope and optimism, the author recollects each each item in the final paragraph, showing that there is hope for Saeng and her family.  	3	3		3																					
2156	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The concludes the story with the paragraph above because it shows Saeng is a carring person to nature. I know this because of this quote, �one of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it.� This quote show that she cares for the little things in nature. Another quote that show Saeng is caring towards nature is, �she tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand.� This shows that Saeng is very caring to a small plant, which is part of nature. So in conclusion the author concluded the story with the paragraph above to show the Saeng is a carring person towards nature.	0	0		0																					
2157	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it helps to explain the significance of the hibiscus. The hibiscus are very important to her and her culture. When there hibiscus around, Saeng feels that she can do anything. That is why she failed the test in the first place. So she is saying that the next time she takes the test, she will have the strength from the hibiscus to help her pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2158	4	This shows that she has not givven up and is going to try hard to adopte and do well in this new land. It leavs a sad story off with a happy ending. The hibiscus is a sigh of hope and so is spring, this makes the en time thing be fkor, without this part the story would be a sad one, but with it is one of hope. The way that the rest of the story is told is as if this is a turning point or an end to the en time boot. It is on resa lution without a resolution.	1	2		2																					
2159	4	The authors concludes the passage with this paragraph phrase to show that after all of that hear tacke and confusion she knows it will take time to adjust and she realizeses that she�ll be ready given time to heal and start fresh, just as he plant.	1	1		1																					
2160	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. because she wants to make a goal for herself in the future. She wants to pass the test, and she will try hard to do it next year. For example, her mother was mad she didn�t pass the test, but then soon forget about it. Saeng did not forget about failing the test. She vowed herself to the hibiscus because she loves that plant and will do anything for it.	1	1		1																					
2161	4	The author ends the passage with this sentence to show that in order to succed, one must keep trying. Saeng will adapt to her new copiuntry in time but not if she spends heer time wishing to go back to her homeland. The hibiscus is a reminder to hers of starting a new and adapting to society. Saeng will retry her driver�s test when the plant buds again, starting its life cycle all over again	1	2		2																					
2162	4	She is say that she will take the test again after the snow melts in the spring. So she can watch the geese the hibiscus bud while she is taking her test and try to pass it.	1	1		1																					
2163	4	The author ended this story with this paragraph because thats now Saeng felt. She felt connteced  to the geese  and the hibiscus ,� She had lifted her head and watched as their distinctive was etched ,�  � almost familiar to her now ,� She will retake the test in the spring . The hibiscus and the flower will make he feel better in the spring . she should pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2164	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how the hibiscus flower profoundly implanted Saeng�s life and gave her new found courage and strength. For example, while on her way home after failing her driver�s test, Saeng sees a flower and says, �[I] felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.� This shows the deep concentration between Saeng and the hibiscus and it is this connection that will guide her through the tough times. Saeng subsequently was into a flower shop and identified all the flower there from her childhood. She realizes that her old home had all these flowers and Saeng used this connection to her past to further increase her courage in adapting into her knew life. Another example is when in the text it states, �She realized that many of the things she thought of was strange before had become�almost familiar to her now.� Saeng comes to this realization by listening to her mother talk of how the hibiscus flower which normally survived at her old home would be able to survive here. She understood that she too would be able to do so and not think things like big @CAPS1 here would be strange anymore. It is in this way that the hibiscus tree offers Saeng support, courage and even strength.  	3	3		3																					
2165	4	�When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself .in the spring ,when the snow melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again �.So which mean when they come back she has to make a test up ,so they don�t have to worry about it later.But  on there trip they seen a lot of different thing ,the soil was cold and hard they couldn�t much with it.She though it was walking into another world ,hot, moist world exploding with with greenery @CAPS1  frends and ones of shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion .And beside it was yet another old  friend a small shrub with waxy leaves and the dainty flower with the purplish petals and white centers .It was already dusk when Saeng reach home ,the wind was blowing hard tearing off last remants of green in the chicory weeds that grew thre the crack of the sidwak .So @CAPS2 to they saw a lot of thing on their trip.So saw thing  they never  seen before like the wed growin therw the sidewalk.	1	0		1																					
2166	4	I think the author includes this to show the determination to pass this test no matter what.	1	1		1																					
2167	4	The author might conclude the story with this because it shows that the girl had confidence that when the flower blooms she will be able to pass. Back at her home land that flower mean't alot to her and it still does. But it seems like this flower gives her hope and pride. She used to pick it with her grandmother and put it in her hair. So when she sees the flower, she will think of her grandmother and that will motivate her to keep going. The flower is strong and can stand through winter weather, so the girl is determinded that when the flower blooms, she will be able to past the test.	2	3		3																					
2168	4	The author conclude the story with �When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�.because she wanted to grow hibiscus in the winter time. She had failed the first time and she wanted to redeem herself and do it the second time arround. She didn�t want to fail again so she did some things differently. She planted it with care patted the soil down firmly around the plant. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2169	4	The girl says that she is going to take the test again when the Hibiscus blooms shows that she misses her country and still wants to be connected somehow. When she takes the test as the plant blooms its like support from her country. The plant is symbolic of her progress because her growth is like the plant. When she first got it she wast ready to go out and do things she still hadnt adapted lutlly to the environment just like the hypiscus wast adapted to the wather and had to wait till @DATE1 to bloom.	2	2		2																					
2170	4	"�then I will take that test again� [@NUM1] Saeng�s whole intention in the story was to take the test and pass it. Houever, ""I-@CAPS1] failed the test, [Ho, @NUM2] which brought the whole story together. She yearned for comfort as she seeked the �@CAPS2 Malik� [Ho, @NUM3] for comfort. Seeing this brought back all the memories of her life �back home� [@NUM1] that kept her going. As a result, bonding with her mother erupted, and it brought another day of hope for her future in her new home. Enough hope for her to say, �when they come back in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�"	1	2		2																					
2171	4	The author ended this story with this sentence because it�s a good conclution. It�s a good conclution because it closes by telling what she will do. This is good  because it shows that Saeng had finally realized that she needs to take that test even though she likes nature so much.	0	0		0																					
2172	4	"The autor of ""winter Hibiscus"" conclded the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeg is going to give the test another try.

2173	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, ends by, �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author concludes that story with that quote because the author sees spring as a new beginning. The author knows to work hard and needs to starts over. For example, some students fail the second semester and look at winter as a new start.	1	1		1																					
2174	4	The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring.	0	0		0																					
2175	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng has overcome an obstacle in her life and that she is learning to move on. In the story Saeng is often stuck on past memories rather than making new ones. For example, when Saeng goes to the florist shop to purchase the plant, she starts remembering old memories from her homeland. When she sees the plant labeled �jasmine�, she thinks of her grandmother that died and remembers how she used to put jasmine blossoms in her hair. Also, she tells her mother that the hibiscus she bought is �not a real one� and she also says it�s �not like the kind we had before.� @CAPS1, she keeps comparing her new life to her old life in her homeland and she does not allow her new experiences to be as good as her old ones. @CAPS1 when the author concludes the story with that paragraph, it shows growth in the girl, Saeng, and that she is willing to move on and make new memories, such as trying to pass her driving test again.	2	2		2

2178	4	" Tisaeng had failed her drivers test after she went to ""flour is it and bought� a plant it was the ""dok faeng � noi"", she had fond memories about the plant. She remembered it from Vietnam, and how it used to be everywhere all the time. She had bought �@CAPS1 hibiscus� as a comfort to herself. The  last paragraph says,� �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� Saeng figured out that things happen for a reason and opportunities occur over and over again. Just as the geese go south and @CAPS2 as the seasons change. She had decided she will retake the test next time she gets a change."	2	2		2																					
2179	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� To show that the character has become a part of her new environment. Just like the environment, she is constantly going through changes, and in the spring when all things that couldn�t be their best during winter begun to thrive, she will too. And when she begins thriving and feels like herself again, then she�ll be ready to take the driving test, and pass. She�ll have returned to her old self like the geese return home when she's done crying like the snow� s done melting, and when she�s done crying like the snow�s done melting, and when she�s ready to open up, just like the hibiscus begin budding, she�ll be ready to take the test.	3	2		3																					
2180	4	All throughout the story �Winter Hibiscus�, the author gives the feeling as hope and comfort that is obtaned by Saeng when she thinks about the past. And to continue this feeling as hope, the last sentence gives the feeling that Saeng will be better off than she had been at the beginning of the story. For example, at the beginning of the story, Saeng was feeling alrenated, alone, and misplaced in her new country. But as the story progresses, she starts to develop peace of mind and certainly that her future will be brighter with the passing of the and her growing confidence. In conclusion, the author uses the last sentence to give a feeling of hope for Saeng�s future and growing confidence.	2	2		2																					
2181	4	The meaning of the last phrase is to see if the winter hibiscus canre seed and go threw everything to become a flower for the year and repeat the process. 	0	0		0																					
2182	4	Minfong Ho concluded �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph to show hope and renewal for the character Saeng. Spring represents birth and renewal, a second chance for Saeng. She had previously failed what seems to be an important test (perhaps her citizenship test), and motivated her to try and remember her past, which she sorely misses. The winter hibiscus seems to represent herself, and this illustrates it: �it�s-it�s not a real one,� Saeng mumbled she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. �Not like the kind we had before� I know her mother said quietly' 'its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That is what matters. This describes Saeng�s position perfectly � she is not the same, as happy as she once was, but she can make it through the hard times, and can bloom in the spring to take the test again. This shows the purpose of the last paragraph in �winter hibiscus� to show the renewal and hope that Saeng will experience.	3	2		3																					
2183	4	I think that this sentence was choosen to be the last sentence because it shows that Saeng can pass the test. Although she is not at her homeland she still has the ability to do things. As the plant that reminds of home returns and begins to grow Saeng will do the same. I think that it is a good sentence to be at the end and it leaves you wondering if she will pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2184	4	She end, the story with that because the flower gives her strength. It gives her hope and reminds her of home. At her home they were every where, she had to buy this one. She planted it so it can grow through winter. After winter the flower gets huge and she passes her driver test. For reward her mom get her a real Vietnam flower.	1	1		1																					
2185	4	I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she know she was wrong and she want�s to make it up to her mother. Also she is showing her mother how much she really likes nature.	0	0		0																					
2186	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed her driving test the first time and she was saying to herself that she will take it again.	1	1		1																					
2187	4	I think the author used that response because she was showing that she had to go through another @DATE1 or hard work in planting flowers.	0	0		0																					
2188	4	The author concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus � the way she did because she wanted to show saeng �s determination at one point in the story, the author wrote, �she was still too shaky to say the words at home �.  Saeng really missed her old life and her old country. She often wonders when she will be able to go back to it and enjoy herself, because she still has trouble adjusting to her new life. When the author concluded the story, it was done so that saeng could be shown as a person   who would not easily give up. Although she�d had   previous trouble, the end of the story gives new hope for saeng to adjust to her new surroundings. Also, when saeng fails the test, the ending sentence gives newhopes saeng told her mother,�I failed the test �, and she was really down on herself when she said so. The closing sentence gives new hope to saeng and the reader,  that she will work header and do better in the spring. The author shows saeng�s determination to rise above failure   and create a niche of her own in life. In all, the closing sentence in �winter Hibiscus� is used to show saeng�s determination.	3	3		3																					
2189	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she fells to live the geese and her memories relate to the times she sees the geese. I think that her test is in school but she has believe that she�ll pass it by remembering her memories she fells conected to the outside ness. For example, she loves flowers. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2190	4	"The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", with a very spiritual and confident paragraph to show that hope has an important part in our lives. In the story, �Saeng"", a foreign chinese citizen, is touched and flattened by all the majestic plants and nature that was living in the green house. She ventures to find all the plants that remind her of home and to relate them to her past experiences. As she walks through the green house, she whispers and pronounces the names of the nature she sees, �Saebba"", Saeng whispered, �Madagascar periwinkle�, its tag pronounced. �How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild.!! But as her tour grew with time, she soon relizes she is missing some of her memories, and begins to cry. As she reaches home she is greeted by her mother. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. Saeng's mother is touched by her comment, and cheers her up with planting the �hibiscus"". In the end, the author shows strong expression by writting one last paragraph to bring out hope, and emotion, to represent that everyone deserves a second chance."	3	2		3																					
2191	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he basically saying hes never taking that test again. The author is showing that the character doesn�t like this test. And would rather not take it	0	0		0																					
2192	4	The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about over coming obstacles and is telling the reader to try again. It is important to never give up and to keep trying until you sucede. In the story Saeng had just moved away from Vietnam she really missed it, and on top of it saeng failed her drivers test. She was really upset. She saw a group of geese flying above her and said when they come back in the spring and my new plant starts to grow I will retake my drivers test. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter. The cold weather is an obstacle for them. Also her new plant can't grow until its warm. Her plant has to over come being small until it can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time. You have to keep trying inorder to get around them.	3	3		3																					
2193	4	The short story �winter Hibiscus end the way it does because the narrator realizes that with simply comes a new chance or opportunity to start over a rebirth. One passage from the text that shows the narrator�s hope, �Almost reluctantly, she realised that many of the things that he had thought of as strange before, through that quiet repetition of season upon season,almost familiar to her now (Ho @NUM1). This passage of text shows that she realized that alot of things to her before suddenly had purpose. She realized that there is a new rebirth in the spring. The conclusion sentences states that she is going to retake the test in the spring. She now realizing that she now by a whole new opportunity and life to start. The conclusion sentence of �Winter Hibiscus� is one of realization of opportunity with spring beginning.	2	2		2																					
2194	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the motivation and confidence Saeng has after her experience with the plant. there are many reasons and examples that support this. One reason is, he want to show the change in Saeng after he first test and when she boaght the flower to releive her. For example, after she failed the driving test, Saeng goes to the Florist. When she see this plant, he childhood comes back and she forgets her test. This flower motivates her to get her lisence. Another reason is, it shows how confident this experience has made her. For example, after failing, she comes back saying,� ... I will take the test again.� In conclusion, the author includes this paragraph to show how confident Saeng has become over her experience.	2	2		2																					
2195	4	The author concludes that statement at  the story at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng wont give up just like the hibiscus.For example the hibiscus does its  best to survive in the winter and blooms and starts over in the spring.Saeng will also survive the winter and star all over again in the spring and retake the test. The author  wanted  to  show  the readers that Saeng is the hibiscus in a way that she has to start over and retry what she has failed as if the hibiscus had died in the winter.	2	2		2																					
2196	4	My response is that if is about winter so realy it is going to be about witer walking around having fun and all them thing.	0	0		0																					
2197	4	The author concludes the story like that to make the reader more intrested and to understand it will all happen again and again year after year. 	1	1		1																					
2198	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he wants to show that the flower was her inspiration to take the test before. The way I got my response was, throughout the story, @PERSON1 was always either gardening the hibiscus or had one. This obviously showed me that she was inspired by this flower and its beuty. In conclusion, the author ends the story like this to show the importance of the Hibiscus flower to Saeng.	1	1		1																					
2199	4	The auther ends the story in this way because it represents the new brith that will take place. It�s almost as if she�s saying that she will hibernate during the winter, and when spring returns and everything begins a new cycle of life, then so will she. Saeng �realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through queit repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� She is saying that when the new season begins it will be her beginning and she�ll have a different outlook on her new life.	2	2		2																					
2200	4	The author ends the story this way to wrap everything up. The author incorporated nature and descriptions of it. This was so the reader would get an image in their head of how �Beautiful or calming� spring supposively is.	1	1		1																					
2201	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it suggest that her strength will come when the flowers come and she will be able to take the test.	1	1		1																					
2202	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story that paragraph because, she wants to show the determination the girl in the story possess. At first, the girl could not help herself and bought the expensive flower. She did not want her mother to be disappointed though, so she was determined to ""pass the test."" In the spring when it is time to buy more seeds, the girl wants to be able to buy the seeds. So the author is showing the trait of determination that the girl controls."	1	1		1																					
2203	4	The author concludes the story with When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the shows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because the hibiscus budding would symbolize starting over and Saeng taking the test again is giving her a chance to start over fresh and try again. The hibiscus doesn�t stop budding so Saeng shouldn�t stop trying!	2	1		2																					
2204	4	In the last paragraph of the story, the author concludes the story like that because the author means to say that the hibiscus is the symbol of overcoming obstacles. For example, @CAPS1 mother says �Its flowers aren�t pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months.� This is a symbol to overcome obstacles as a flower is strong enough to make it through the cold months, in which the weather is rough. In Saeng�s case, she is a girl who will make it in a foreign country. Thus, in the last paragraph, when Saeng vows silently to herself that she will take the drivers test again when the snow melts (writers over) and the hibiscus is budding, she uses the hibiscus as a symbol of overcoming the obstacle of failing the test. That is why the author decided to end the story with that last paragraph. 	3	3		3																					
2205	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted to convey a sense of determination of Saeng wanting to comput what she started. She had failed the drivers test and is very disappointed, for example, she starts to cry and has �tear stains and puffy eyes� as she remembers her homeland in Vietnam, her life, her memories, her family etc. She can relate to the geese that migrate during the winter and return again, an as new begginings start in the spring, so would she. A fresh start like the blossoming hibiscus. A fresh start with the drivers test.	2	2		2																					
2206	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show the aduiance that Saeng @CAPS1 gave up so you should'nt either. I think that this paragraph is describin a law of life witch is �@CAPS1 give up.� @CAPS2 even though she had failed at first she is still willing to try again.	1	1		1																					
2207	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things	0	0		0																					
2208	4	She should and needs too learn that you can�t replace a plant with the same thing and expect it too be as equal too it. She needs too learn that lesson in life.	0	0		0																					
2209	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will follow  nature  and  try to  fit  into her  new  land. Saeng  has failed  her  driver�s   test  and  feels  out  of place  in  her  new home. The text states, �As  Saebba  nedae  tall  and  lush. And  surrounded  there  garden� (No 1).When  she  sees  the @CAPS1 it reminds her of old home where she fit in.Now she  wants to wait to see  that flower  grown  so when she takes the driver�s test again.Also,she sees geese fly over her head when she plants he r flower. The  author  writes. ��She  realized  that  many  of  the  things that she had thought strange before  had become�almost  familiar  to  her how�(No @NUM1).The geese coming back in the spring will now  also  remind her  of  her  new  name  and  how  must  try  to  live  there happily now. In the last paragraph the  author writes,� I will take that test again�(No @NUM1).This gives the feeling of Saeng  trying to start a  new  beginning in this new home.  	3	3		3																					
2210	4	This is a powerful sentence that demonstrates themes in the story. Saeng is determined to try again because she has been comforted by symbol of her homeland. This sentence shows what the plant has done for Saeng�s spirit and shows how that symbol helps heal her. The sentence is able to wrap up the story and demonstrates the importance of the hibiscus. In the story @CAPS1 describes the plant as a friend and remmeder of her homeland. Once she sees the plant in bloom she`ll know that she can take the test again. The paragraph is a great conclusion to the passage because it summarizes everything that the hibiscus has meant for Saeng.	2	2		2																					
2211	4	I think the author is just trying to show that you never give up. I think the author is trying to show the beautie of nature. The author used that because in the story Saeng failed the test but at the end it says that she will take the test again. In the story it talks about the winter hibiscus that she planted and that is concluded in the conclusion. The conclusion basiclly saying is there will be a new beginning.	1	1		1																					
2212	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hisbiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� because the paragraph its self concluded already. It basically sumed up what she was going to do all over again next time because she had already done it. What the author means by this paragraph is that when the plants come back in the spring she is going to have to do all the work again which was basically the test.	0	0		0																					
2213	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the readers know that she doesnt give up. They @MONTH1 have thought that she thaght the test back home were more important. So she wouldnt care about passing this test because she misses her home and wouldnt care about those test.	1	1		1																					
2214	4	I think that the auther end the story Like that as a meterphor For people to think out side the @CAPS1 or thing. OR The auther might oF ended it Like that so people can get a picture in the head about what she was talking about.	0	0		0																					
2215	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to give You an idea of how she feels about what happened to her. This paragraph is her telling herself that everything is ok and she going to do better next time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to make Saeng sound more confident in herself. In the middle of the story when she was having the conversation with her mother, she sounded unconfident with herself so this paragraph made her sound like she was sure with herself, like she knew what she was going to do.	2	1		2																					
2216	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�, I think that the author concludes the story in �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is dudding, then I will take that test again� because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and make new flowers the Saeng should do the same. Therefore thats why the author added that quet to the end of the story	2	1		2																					
2217	4	Saeng failed her driver�s test at the beginning of the story. She finds a hibiscus plant and buys it because it reminds her of her life in Vietnam. She sates, �The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long grey hair.� The flower reminds her of her grandmother. The mother says, �??? Seen this kind blooming along the lake, it�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make through the cold months.� She�s trying to make her daughter feel better. It states, �Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by their fault honks clear and yes-familiar to Saeng now. She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.�	2	2		2																					
2218	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the end she realizes that the things that seemed strange before she had just realized as the seasons were changing and the plants. So the author put that paragraph at the end because in the spring she goes back to school to take the test again	1	1		1																					
2219	4	The author concludes the story the way he or she dose because it shows that the time she found the plant that she will get her lisens So it is a reminder for her. I also think she did it that way because when the plant blooms it starts over and so when she sets on gose to take a chance at the test she is starting new	1	1		1																					
2220	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to show that the peace that the peace that the flower gave will build her confidence and she will not give up. I know this because in the story the main character fails her driving test and when she sees the flower it helps remind her of the home she had in Vietnam. Another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and it never stops blooming. She knows it will never give up and she relaizes that she shouldn�t either. Plus the plant gives her stength to try again. So the reason the author ends her story with that paragraph is to show the power the flower that was know to her, give her and how she will no give up.	2	2		2																					
2221	4	The author concludes the story with this ending paragraph because. It combine the two inpefect situations. When she said when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the gese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take test again. She will prove her point and abbreviated the situation.	0	0		0																					
2222	4	The author is saying that she would take the test again in the spring instead of the winter cause she would be more focus to just keep her mind on the test & not the planting.	0	0		0																					
2223	4	I think she ended the story with that because throout the wole story she trys to work hard. And this last sentence is saying that its not over, That she will be back to take the test again. She trys to prove herself during the whole book. And she will continue working hard to get what she wants  	1	1		1																					
2224	4	In the story the author concludes the story the way she did because it is metaphoric, I say this because she is comporing herself to the hibiscus plant. As a hibiscus would be tested to over come conditions such as the cold and forexample in the test the author states � its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here. This winter hibiscus�. She as the hibiscus will bloom again and have to pass the test of surviving the cold, will be able to have a chance to pass her own test, that is why the author concludes the story as she did.	2	2		2																					
2225	4	The concluding paragraph in the story �Winter Hibiscus �portrays the powerful massage of change from a cold, distant failure to adapt, to a new life. Saeng relates her transformation to the changing seasons from winter to spring . this is obvious shown it states  �in the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding . she accepts this as a new chance to start fresh , and then try to pass the test. The change from winter  to spring symbolize saeng�s hardship  of flying to adapt to her new home. And then, as the geese   return and the hibiscus is  adapting in its new environment is the symbol by which saeng  follows as it is from her old home in Vietnam, but can now  also prosper elsewhere. 	3	2		3																					
2226	4	 The  author concludes with this because it had the most impact. The ending also gave the most meaning. The meaning of the last paragraph is that time will help her adjust to where she is now living. It also incorporates the hibiscus flower and how it will bloom again, this could have a double meaning, and mean that the authors life will bloom again. Overall it was a good way to conclude the paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2227	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus"" I believe they end the story the way they did, �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� because with saeng making a goal, she�s overcoming her disappointment and uncomfort living in a new country. The archetyple meaning of a flower bud is: prosper, new, growth. This shows he growing and that�s important in life and that�s why the ended it the way they did. It�s a positive ending."	2	2		2																					
2228	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she realizes her connection to the hibiscus plant. All through the story Saeng thinks about native plants she�s seen before are now in @LOCATION1. She sees how they�re adapted to life there, like in the way the hibiscus can survive the winter. Saeng realizes that she also must adapt in her new home. She doesn�t necessarily need to adapt to survive, but to be successful. She vows that in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding (restarting its growth cycle) she will restart too and retake the test.	2	3		3																					
2229	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the author�s final paragraph shows how much the hibiscus means to her. The author uses symbolism when, he talks about the hibiscus because it is a strong plant just like the girl needs to be to pass the driving test. The author put the paragraph at the end to show that if the hibiscus can come back, after winter, so can the girl. In conclusion, the author used the last paragraph to emphasize the meaning of the hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2230	4	The story is full of emotion and homesickness that it can be a bit depressing, so the author wanted to end with message of hope. After saeng failed the test �in the maint shelter of the greenhouse (she) broke down and wept,� it�s inspiring to know that she�ll keep tryinh despite all her hardship. I know first hand that homesickness can be pretty bad, and finding the strength to keep going and make the promise� to take that test again� can be very hard but worthwhile .  The author also used the ending to give another meaning to the hibiscus for �when the geese return  and the hibiscus is blooming � when the winter is over hard times are past, there will be new hope in a new, beautiful spring. 	3	2		3																					
2231	4	The reason why the author concluded the story with that paragraph was because at basically explained everything You needed to know for the ending. It basically explains that she is willing to take the time to study for the test she had previously taken and did not pass and wants to take it again once spring arrives. For example, the geese had left for the winter. and once they return in the spring, she will take the test over again, in conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it best explains the ending of the story.	1	1		1																					
2232	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the growth or hope that Saeng has that she will be comfortable in the United States. When she said “I-I failed the test,” I took it as failing the test to see if she got over her country and if   	1	1		1																					
2233	4	"In the story ��winter hibiscus by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.�� @CAPS1 is shows that you should fight. For whats right and what you belive in."	0	0		0																					
2234	4	Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower.	1	2		2																					
2235	4	Saeng did get the feel that she called fil in and. Buying something that could help her but also have her missing were she from. And with her mother get a little mad about it because the prags she pay for. It @CAPS1 vowed silently to herself in the spring that she take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2236	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author concludes this story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has confidence to take the driving test.	1	1		1																					
2237	4	 The author leaves the story there because it keeps you guessing on what is going to happen. That is really all you need to know about the story. The important parts the author has told al ready & the future is a whole different story. It doesn�t matter if Saeng passes the test or what happens over the winter. The author has told us everything to know about the importance of this person & her mother	1	1		1																					
2238	4	Saeng feels out of place in her new home and new country. She vows silently that in a year she will take the test again. She vows that in a year she will be used to her new home and new country and will start to enjoy life again. The author concluded with this paragraph because the girl Saeng will hopefully enjoy her new home and in a year she will be used to what happens in her new country. Saeng just feels out of place and she wants to wait a while until she tries to retake the test. The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she made a vow to herself and hopefully she will keep the vow and make it happen.	2	1		2																					
2239	4	The author might of concluded the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isnt @CAPS1 to stop trying shes @CAPS1 to work harder. As she sees the Geese adapting she chooses to try. and make their wew home work out. After they disapear she picks herself up and says that shes @CAPS1 to try again. By doing this she is commiting herself to try @CAPS2 things t adapt to changes.	2	2		2																					
2240	4	I think she ends the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the test in the @DATE1 time when it won�t be so hard on her. It will be warm again and it�s not quite as cold.	1	1		1																					
2241	4	The story concludes with this paragraph for a number of reasons. First, in the spring it is warm and sunny and this helped to end the story in a happy note. Next this shows that Saeng can adapt to her new home, as the hibiscus will through winter. Finally, it shows Saeng is determined and won't let her mother down. That is why the story concludes with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2242	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show if they can adapt then she can too. �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. �I choose this saying because it shows you if they are able to come back after everything that has happen she can to. She should be able to adapt to a new place just like they do.	2	1		2																					
2243	4	Authors often end stories with paragraph that make readers wonder what happens next. In Winter Hibiscus by: Minfong Ho there is an ending paragraph just like that. The author ends it like this because she is looking towards the future. She says that she will take the test when the snow melts, the gesse come back, and the hibiscus bluming. She is looking at it like that is a new beggining. She wants to start over. Also the gesse, blooming hibiscus, and melted show gives her hope that she will pass her test. She belives now they have a hibiscus maybe it will be more like where she use to live. Authors use endings that make people wonder so people think. 	2	1		2																					
2244	4	The response that the author concludes the story with this peragraph because  the author wanted us that read the story to understanding what was going on in the story. like for the @CAPS1 they was sayin when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibicus is budding then I will take that test again, was tryin to see where everybody head at in the story so they can understanding what the author be talkin about.	0	0		0																					
2245	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because the geese and the hibiscus were both things that were familiar to Saeng They remind her of her homeland,When  the familiar things return ,she will have the strength to the test again and hopefully do better.The narrator says �Overhead a of Canada geese flew by,their faint hunks clear and �yes-fimiliar to Saeng now �.This shows how the geese are a symbol of the fimilar things from her homeland that help Saeng feel more comfortable in her new home.	1	2		2																					
2246	4	The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant makes her think of where she is from and helps her to succeed a certain things. I know that the hibiscus is from her homeland because in the story she says �I mean, not like the kind we had at�at-�, she found that she was still to shaky to say the words at home.� She misses being home and this plant helps her bring back memorys of being there. Therefore the author included that paragraph to show the reader that she misses her homeland.	1	1		1																					
2247	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph why @CAPS1 it might be important to the author about Saeng. It some thing personely about her past or where she had came for. She trying to say that when she come back in the spring she going to take the test again in school. OR She is going to plants something over again the spring @CAPS1. As snow @CAPS2 and its too cold to plant any thing. That where she came from is really important to her and she miss it and went to go back to where she Come from. 	1	1		1																					
2248	4	"The author concludes this story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, whe the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take the test again"". She does this because in the story this plant has given her a lot of beilef in herself to @MONTH1 be do better in the future."	1	1		1																					
2249	4	The author concludes the story this ways for a few reasons. One reason is that she will have more experience with her new country. She only left her homeland a few months before so in about six more months she will be more knowledgable about the ways of the new country. This will make her more capable of passing the @CAPS1 Ed test. Also in the spring is when the flower will be beautiful again and this will give her new-found strength that will cause her to pass. The few months time will allow the author time to mentally and physically prepare for the exam. Mentally, she will be able to study and learn all she needs to know. And physically she will age which will also teach her new things.	1	2		2																					
2250	4	In order to get over her failure, Saeng bought a flower that reminded her of home. Saeng�s started to cry when she bought the flower. She wanted to be back home. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show how she will take the test when she feels like she is at home. �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� Saeng said to herself. Those things make her feel welcome and feeling that way will help her with her test. The paragraph concludes the story with all the things she is comfertable with. This conclusion helps the reader understand what reminds her of home. Also explains how much the hibiscus flower ment to her. Buying the flower helps her with her troubles. Seeing the geese fly reminds her of her home. The author concludes the story with the memories that will help Saeng in the future.	2	2		2																					
2251	4	I think the author ended this story with this conclusion because, every one should have fresh starts, or second chances. I guess the author was leaving in a message stating if you fail once you should at least try again. When Saeng failed the test it seems as though her self-esteem lowered, and her mother tried cheering her up, and eventually she realized it will be bad giving up and not trying again with a fresh start.	1	1		1																					
2252	4	"Minfong Ho included the last paragraph in the story because it alluded to the fact that saeng felt better and more confident when reminded of home. when saeng saw the hibiscus she got a feeling ""so intense, it was almost visceral.� The flower was creatively used by Ho. She said that the winter hibiscus is strong enough to make it through the cold months, which made the reader think after reading the last paragraph, that this flower must give saeng hope and confidence. Also, the geese make a V which I infured would mean Vietnam to saeng which is what the author is trying to get her reader to think. That is why �and the geese return.� is mentioned in the last paragraph. Minfong Ho wants her readers to realize that objects that make us more comfortable and happy are what make us strong and confident in the end. The author did a great job placing that last thought into the last paragraph because it perfectly sums up the lesson, and that is that you should do things when you feel confident and it feels like home to you. You @MONTH1 be small and fragile, but if you �plant� yourself you can thrive with confidence. "	2	3		3																					
2253	4	The last paragraph at the end of the story was the authors way of showing how Saeng wanted spring to come early because she wants to see her hibiscus. If spring doesn�t come fast she will not get to see her hibiscus and the snow won�t melt. When Saeng comes up she hopes she can take the test.	1	1		1																					
2254	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. ""because that winter hibiscus symbolizes a new beginning for her. For example back in her home town she had hibiscus's and everything was fine and normal, she lived her life and so on, well then she moved to the u.s, and she didn�t have any hibiscus, she just failed her driving test, she feels miss placed, and doesnt fit in. So, when she saw that winter hibiscus she felt as if she found something to help her feel at home or at ease almost. She felt a sense of security In conclusion the author ended with that sentence because its a new beginning for her and that hibiscus means a new start."	2	2		2																					
2255	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story.	2	2		2																					
2256	4	The reason why the author concludes the store with on small paragraph is because some time the little things count the most and the authore thouth t that in two setses that he could summarz the most important things in the story and I think that the author did a great job.	0	0		0																					
2257	4	The author concludes with with paragraph because Saeng has to take the test all over. She @MONTH1 think theres a better chance when it blooms and the snow melts. So that is when Saeng is going to try and take the test after the snow melts and the hibiscus blooms	1	1		1																					
2258	4	The author concludes with this sentence for a couple reasons. Saeng feels that she can�t do it until the spring because that when the geese come back. Also that is when the hibiscus buds. In a way she feels as though she will blossom in spring and be able to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2259	4	I think that the authoR includes this paRagRaph in this stoRy b/c the gRandmothER might think that it is a tEst to sEE what she can gEt donE @CAPS1 time. The gRandmotheR might gEt more done then should @CAPS2.	0	0		0																					
2260	4	I think that the author concludes the story like that because @MONTH1 be she�s saying that by that time she�ll be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @MONTH1 be by that time when that happens in spring she would be preprared and more confident of herself. @MONTH1 be the author was trying to say that just like the begining of a new springs, it would be a new beginning for her.	2	1		2																					
2261	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is saying that she will try again. For example, despite failing her driving test she decides to take it over after having the experience of planting with her mother. It seems as if planting the hibiscus has gained her some confidence in striving to succeed once again. In the story it seemed that she was getting used to planting. For example, now that she has done something and accomplished that she knows that she can take the test again and accomplished that. In conclusion, that is why I think the author concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2262	4	The author concludes the story with a statement that makes you think because she wants to emphasize the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus. Just like Saeng, the hibiscus is in a new environment and has to adapt to the surroundings. Saeng had just failed her driving test so shes bummed about that. The concluding sentance makes you realize that Saeng can overcome her driving challenges if the plant can overcome the harsh surroundings.	2	2		2																					
2263	4	the author includes this as the last paragraph because it could give Saeng�s mother hope. It could give hope because they could really need Saeng to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2264	4	It was very important that the author concluded the story with that paragraph. It reastablished the meaning of the hibiscus and why it was important to Saeng. I showed the determination she had in overcoming her problems with living in a new place. Without this paragraph we would have been left assuming what was to come of Saeng. In some stories it would have worked but in this case it was needed. When she first saw the hibiscus she broke down becaus she could not remember her home land. This is why the hibiscus is so important to the story. By restating the importance of it in the end helped the reader follow what was to come next eventhough the story had come to an end. It was important to express this again. In the last paragraph is says, �This hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The buds represent a new beginning for Saeng and a new chance to overcome her problems. This paragraph was very important and without it these events would be left hanging. The meaning of the story is much clear with it as a reader.	2	3		3																					
2265	4	Including the bit about taking the test again when the �hidiscus is budding� provides a sense of closeur and lesson to an otherwise open ending. Saeng fails the drivers test early in the story, then on her way home she buys a hibiscus. The reader really doesn�t see a connection until this last paragraph. The hibiscus represents perserverence and strength. After a harsh winter this hibiscus can bloom again and ard continue to live. Even after moving from Vietnam, and struggling to adapt, Saeng must recover, ard keep trying. Just like the flower blooming again, so will Saeng. She will take the test a second time and pass. She will adapt to her environment, and keep going, just like the hibiscus.	3	2		3																					
2266	4	The  author concludes  the  story  with  the  paragraph  � When  they  come  back  ,  Saeng  vowed  silently  to  herself  in  the  spring  ,  when  the   snow  melt  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is  budding  ,  the  I  will  take  the   test  again ,�  because  the  author  started  out  the  story  after  Saeng  failed  her  driving  test  .  Saeng  is  reminded  from  the  Hibiscus  about  her  homeland.  After  Saeng  wanted  the  Hibiscus  in  the  garden  ,�  a  flock  it  canada geese  flow by �,  as  they  flew  by  Saeng  felt  a  sign  at  comfort  and  vowed  to  herself  what  started  everything  .  If  Saeng  did  pass  the  driving  test  then  she  would  of  never  found  the  Hibiscus.	1	2		2																					
2267	4	The author include it because her mother took the test and passed it and the daughter wanted to do the same Just like her mom. And she can only take it in the spring because there is no flowers out in the winter.	0	0		0																					
2268	4	In think the author is trying to show that Saeng is finally starting to accept and get over the struggles in the life. It is showing that she has finally gotten used to @LOCATION1 and the customs, but she still hasn�t forgotten her heritage. �But she had herself much preferred it to a big Mac.� It also proves that she is going to be positive and not let disc overage her. She�s going to retake it and try again. During the beginning look on her situations in life. But after visiting the floral shop, she discovers a more cherry. Optimistic outlook on her situation and decides to do something about it.	2	2		2																					
2269	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because she�s concluding that the winter is there, and when winter is over, she is going to start flowering and planting again. In the story it said, �the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,�.� So, now she has to wait for winter to pass by then the hibiscus will be starting to grow and will hopefully be alone by spring. So, that is why I think she concluded the story the way she did.	0	0		0																					
2270	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the question of what about her test? Needed to be answered and that�s when she'd to comfortable to take it. In the text. To her, the plant felt smooth and cool just as she had known it, which was comforting. She closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. Unlike her grandmother, she felt a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung her eyes, with sadness, and maybe disapointment, which she probably word want to deal with for a while, hinted at in the conclusion her mother even uttered a small cry of surprise and delight to see the flower, even before being shocked when Saeng reveals she paid all of over nineteen dollars for it. With this concluding paragraph, I believe that she will be more comfortable at the time. planned because she'll have new and old things to come home to, such as the geese and plant.                	2	1		2																					
2271	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author includes this ending paragraph because she wants to show that next time around she will be prepared and ready for the garden and the challenges it holds. This first time, she wasn�t ready, and she didn�t know about the winter hisbiscus because she never did anything like it before.	0	0		0																					
2272	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the story ends with saying �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� The reason the author ends the story like that is because it showing that eves though she @MONTH1 of failed the test once shes not going to give up just because of as adjustment change. The Hibiscus made the reader relize that a plantation where she lives can adapt so can she. 	1	1		1																					
2273	4	The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.	1	1		1																					
2274	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a personification involving snow smelting, geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. It�s explaining moments in time. The author describes how isolated the hibiscus is.	0	0		0																					
2275	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because it�s telling how Saeng  feel about winter being near and how she have to wale  until spring come back around to do her teast again.  	1	1		1																					
2276	4	Saeng cares about the flowers. She cares about the flower. Natural occurrence with them growing unique.	0	0		0																					
2277	4	In the story I don�t know why the author and the story with that I really don�t know, maybe she was talking about she took all test now she wouldn�t take it over again atey. The times come. She in school and when one took the test of was that kind of wealth now that of not of is @DATE1 and school is over. 	0	0		0																					
2278	4	Why the author concludes this paragraph into the story is because at the end off the story they needed and ending. Also why is because the picked and conclusion that would best fit this story.	0	0		0																					
2279	4	I believe that the author chose to conclude the story the way they did because the story was about perserverance. For example, the story was baised around the winter hibscus plant. This is a good example because in the end Saeng vows that she will perserveer and take her test again and the hibiscus perserveers and forges through the winter not allowing itself to die. Another example that @CAPS1 mother worked outside while it was cold to get her gardening done. This relates to the story because her stayed out in the cold garden to get her job done, she could have quit and gone inside the nice warm house, just like Saeng could have quit and said she was not going to try to take her test agin. But she did not, she said she was going to try again. 	2	3		3																					
2280	4	I  think  the  author  ended  this  story  like  that  because  it  means  that  she  hasent gave up yet and even though she failed the  first time she is come try again,� In the spring , when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding .� mean that when all is @CAPS1 .� She will try to do it again because if she passes it will be @CAPS1. The story was preety bad because I don�t even know what she  failed  so I didn�t  like it.	1	1		1																					
2281	4	I think the reason why the author ended the story with this �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.� paragraph because like this the plant didn�t have a fight chance for survival in the winter and was same with the girl when she took her driving test but in spring the plant has chance bloom so she has a chance to pass the test because because there time and place for everything.	1	1		1																					
2282	4	"Emotion, camitmint, hope, all are reasons why the author ended the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the gees return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1, that last paragraph shows that she has emotion. Next, It shows that she has comitmint, she says that when the hibiscus coms back she will take the test again. Lastly, it shows that there is hope and the she will try and redeam herself. These are all the reasons why she used the last paragraph."	2	1		2																					
2283	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize her new found determination to overcome her obstacles. For example, in the passage she states, �she realized that many of the things she had thought strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiarizes to her.� At this point she has an epiphany, and realizes that life is like seasons. In the end paragraph she intercedes this by saying that in the spring she will take the test again. This shows that just as the winter hibiscus is along winter, and then blooms in the spring, she must be strong during these hard times. One day her time will come for her to �bloom.� @CAPS1 experiences hard times, but we all must be strong and steadfast as we wait for our time to �bloom.� 	3	2		3																					
2284	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because, he wanted to show that she wasn�t going to give up just because she failed one time. She failed the test one time already. She was very sad about it. She went and bought a plant. Saeng�s mom told her that they were going to do it the right way. Saeng was crying when she told her mom about it. Her mom was very understanding thought. Her  mom could have been very mad with her. She could of used a plant that they grew. The plant @MONTH1 not grow right now. She should of bought a real plant from someone else.	1	1		1																					
2285	4	Determined, new beginning, symbolism � each are reasons why I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph. She finds new hope after buying the plant, and is newly determined to pass the test that she writes about. As she sees the geese flying overhead, she realizes what determination they must have and vows to do better on the test next year. With the new flower, she feels like shes starting over so that she�s able to pass this test that seems important to her. When the author write, �and the geese will return and this hibiscus in budding, then I will take that test again,� it shows symbolism. By telling about the flower blooming new buds, it symbolizes that Saeng wanted to turn over a new leaf of some sort. Determined, new beginning, symbolism � each are reasons why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.	2	3		3																					
2286	4	The author of � Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho end the story with the statement, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again,� because it showed that Saeng had overcome her problem and vowed to correct it. By ending with this statement the author showed that the beauty of nature can help one to overcome their problems, as did Saeng. Upon seeing the Geese  mignitry and the �Winter  Hibiscus� Saeng, �realized that many of the things that she had thought  of as strange before had become, through the guiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese.� Saeng realized that the test although strange and different to her now became familiar because of her experiences with nature. Seeing the geese and �Winter Hibiscus�. This plant also made Saeng think of her past in Vietnam and all of one good times back at her home. �The familiar  fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could  almost fast the light strures of her grandmothers long gray hair, freshly mashed.� The jolont made her think of good experiences. In the plant made her joyous enough not to think about past, but about the future, about taking the test again and her new life in the United States   	3	3		3																					
2287	4	The reason why the author puts that last line into the story of the end is to show us the raids  and saeng  that even though us almost over. She doesn�t want  it to end but she know that it will also start up again. Next year when things goes back to the way they were before everything changed. This is why I think the author put that line into the story.	0	0		0																					
2288	4	The author concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again� to express her determination of fitting into new things and to express the change she was getting used to. Describing spring was important in the conclusion because it described what Saeng once thought was odd in @LOCATION1, but got used to the seasons and weather changing. Once she realized that she needed to deal with change, she knew that she would need to try the driving test again. It was very important that the author�s conclusion was �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because it expressed how Saeng was accepting change in her life.  	2	2		2																					
2289	4	In �winter Hibiscus� the author uses hibiscus flower to symbolize beauty in unexpected places, adapting to a new life, and Saeng's home country at the end of the story I think that the author realizes that even though she failed the test, everything is going to be okay. While looking at the hibiscus she remembers her old life, which she loved, and she is reminded of the natural beauty that can be found in a hibiscus flower. In life, I think every one should always remember that even though one @MONTH1 be disappointed at sometime, we have to keep in mind, the fact that life goes on. There will always be another chance, as long as you can find peace and beauty in something good.	2	2		2																					
2290	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show how Saeng and the plant are similar. The plant represents Saeng�s strength and abilities. She knows that only when she is stronger, in the spring like the plant, will she be ready to retake the test. Her hopes will be stronger like the plant in the spring. That is why the author concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2291	4	"I beleive the author ends the story with this paragraph because it refers to previous events in the story. For example it says, ""and this hibiscis is budding"". This refers back to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it reminded her of home. This is a good way to conclude a story. I wouldn�t change it at all if I could. Also in the summary before the story it says how she had failed her driver�s test and in the last paragraph it says, ""then I will take that test again,� I think Saeng didn�t have much confidence before taking the test because of her new surroundings but is now that she is familiar with everything and found a hobby she will think of passing while taking the test again. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failing.  "	2	2		2																					
2292	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she overcame and she wants to re take the quiz for herself and to prove it to herself no one else. she states �when they come back, saeng vowed to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. So she says that she wants to retake the test. So she is not being pressured into taking it. She is taking it to prove to herself no one else.	1	2		2																					
2293	4	"In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, a young girl named saeng recalls her life before she moved to @LOCATION1 .She misses her homeland and all of the things she loved before she came here. Towards the end of the story, the author includes a paragraph saying that saeng vowed to take her drivers test again when winter ends, when the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding. The author concludes the story with this paragraph for one reason. He/She wants to show that saeng is strong enough to survive the winter, just like the hibiscus, and will be ready when the weary days of winter are over, and the beautiful days of spring come. Saeng�s mother states, ""�it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months�. That�s what matters"". The winter hibiscus is a direct parallel to saeng in that just like it, she is strong enough to survive the winter months."	2	3		3																					
2294	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to make the reader want more. When an author ends the chapter of a story or an episode of a show it is always a good idea to use a cliffhanger to drag the audience along. In many stories have read this is used. In my @CAPS1, the @PERSON1 book it always ends with a cliff-hanger. Like in the end of the third book one of the soldiers is killed but you don�t find out by who until the next book.	1	1		1																					
2295	4	The author concludes this story the way she does to say that the girl not going to give up on trying to fit in this new country. The author concludes this way because it refers that its not over, and even though the test was a failure, it wont be next time. The author leads is know that the little girl cares about the test, and wants to prove to show people that she can pass it. She is reminded of her home by these flowers, and she has with this she can retake it and do it rite.	2	2		2																					
2296	4	I think the author included that in the paragraph because Saeng didn't like the cold so she would wait until the snow melts and geese return to test the plants again. I also think she added it to show that she would come back to visit her mother.	0	0		0																					
2297	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and in the spring she will take the test over.	1	1		1																					
2298	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it provides closure to both Saeng and the story. Saeng was upset about the fact that she failed her test, but towards the end of the story she realizes that things happen, and sometimes we have no control over what happens, but you�ve also got to pick yourself up again if what happens, knocks you down. When seeing the geese and the hibiscus, she realizes that everyone and everything has to adapt to something new all the time. Saeng might have failed her driving test because they drive differently in Vietnam, so she will have to adopt to the way we drive here, along with all our rule and laws. This is why the author concludes the paragraph in that way.	2	2		2																					
2299	4	Saeng was taking a test and she didn�t quite pass it She was afraid to tell to her mother but she has to tell her anyway. Her mother got upset because she didn�t pass it. Saeng knows  that right after winter's over, She�ll be taking that same test again and she hoped she will pass it this time.	1	1		1																					
2300	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author includes the phrase, -When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.- because she wanted to make the story end Saeng finding the positive views on her new home and positive views in the future and have her look forward to it. Throughout the short story, Saeng happens to have a sad disposition about her new home and how the plants remind her recent home.- �I mean its not the kind we at-at-� she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burt into tears again.- This phrase shows that Saeng really missed her home and was truly sad about it. The concluding phrase shown before shows that she found the strength to look positivly at the future of her new home.	3	2		3																					
2301	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because at the beginning of the story Saeng went to take a driving test but didn�t pass and so she goes and buys a hibiscus that reminds her of home and gives her strength and comfort. So her mother says this at the end because she knows Saeng is going through a hard time adapting to her new country and she doesn�t want to put more pressure on her just because she knows Saeng is very upset and is trying to make it up to her by buy a flower for her so she says by next spring she should be adapted and ready for the test because the flower should give her hope. She wants her to know she is three for her.	1	2		2																					
2302	4	I think the author of �Winter Hibiscus� said �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test  again.� to conclude the story for many reasons. First reason is it shows that she isn�t giving up. The second reason is it gives a feeling of hope of whats to come. The last reason is it leaves us wondering if she makes it next time. That is probably why the author ended it that way.	1	1		1																					
2303	4	The author of the Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with the paragraph to show the connection between the hibiscus and @CAPS1. The hibiscus has to survive the winter until spring were it can bloom and became big and beautiful. @CAPS1 is connecting to the flower and saying she can make it through her obstacles that come with the change in enviroment if the flower can deal with being confined in a plastic container and surviving the weather. She feels that right now she's likes the Hibiscus. She�s trapped because the area is alien to her and she has to adjust. Just as the container is alien to the flower because it�s used to being free. But once it�s planted, it will become a part of it's surroundings and grow. And once she accepts the change and becomes willing to start over, she will begin to grow and that will cause her driving test to be easier. In conclusion, this is the reason the author concluded the paragraph with this sentence.	3	3		3																					
2304	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus�, the author ends with the main character Saeng saying that she will take the test �when the snow melts and the geese return.� I believe that the Hibiscus and the driver�s test are relevant like the blooming of a flower. If it wilts at the first, it can blossom later on, thus the author included this to show that Saeng wilted at first, but will blossom at spring. It also a symbol of her constant blossoming. The author�s intention of the lost line was demonstrated early when Saeng was disappointed of falling the test. She is upset that she failed her driver�s test, but when she sees a flower from her homeland, she starts to get boosted and start to weep a little. It shows her blossoming because she changes from a negative mood to a positive one, after seeing the flower from her childhood memory. It shows her wilt and blossom again when she tells her mother the news about the test. At first she gets nervous and scared, so scared she tears the leaf off and shreds it to pieces. Her mother then wipes the green matter of and asks her to plant it. Saeng then gets a morale boost and start to feel better. This once again shows her blossoming because she thought her mother would yell at her for failing the test, but instead accepts the plant, showing her rise again. Saeng falters throughout the story, but manages to rise above it all and give herself determination to meet her goal. She is determined to pass the test when spring arrives, and blossom again. The Hibiscus shows it with its budding stage. It will blossom like Saeng.  	3	3		3																					
2305	4	The author probably includes part of the story with the paragraph to put more details into the paragraph. The author trying to talk about the life that Saeng had vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again, saying that when flowers start blooming again and spring comes around again thats when I will take that test and pass this time.	1	1		1																					
2306	4	"I think the author concludes the story with this because shes proving she has the strength to do something that she failed the first time again. She took this plant and looked at it as a memory and a passage of time. Saeng planted it as a reminder of home and her promise. Saeng said, �Its not a real one�  ""Not like the kind we had before.� Saeng loved home and wish she was back there but her new promise was what had mattered."	2	1		2																					
2307	4	The author concludes this the story with this paragraph   because its start a whole new  day time . That saying  means  that  she  will  take  the  test on a budding  new day .for  example, the   geese  return  her its spring and  hibiscus budd  and  she  has the test  in  the spring  so it  will  start  why the author concludes the  story  with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2308	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to take the driving test in spring time. Spring time is a symbol of positive feelingsshe gets positive feelings from the blooming of the winter hibiscus.	1	1		1																					
2309	4	They had to come back so they did and they were walking into an then world over there in the corner and the childhood world to just as she had known it would feel.	0	0		0																					
2310	4	This last paragraph is written for several reasons. First, she will try again when she feels the time is right. Just like the geese coming back, Saeng will comebak to take the test, and so the Hibiscus plant will also bloom again. She feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test. This pharagraph describes Saeng well about how she lives and how she will take the test again when she feelsit is right.	2	1		2																					
2311	4	"I believe that the author ends because the author is showing that Saeng is determined to pass the test. ""She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes. ""(Ho) This quote shows that passing the test meant a lot to Saeng. She was crying because she couldn't help but buy the plant and fail the test. She didn't want to fail and showed her sadness by crying.� then I will take the test again.� (Ho) This quote shows that even though she failed, she is determined to pass the test and succeed. Failing hurt her greatly. so she can't wait to do it again and pass because she is determing to succeed. This is all important because Saeng shows that determination is the key to success and she is determined."	1	2		2																					
2312	4	"The author uses this paragraph to conclude the story to show saeng determination and her adaption to her new home. This shows her determination because it say �I will take that test again."" This also shows that she has adapt to her new home."	1	1		1																					
2313	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was upset that she moved. She is also upset that she failed her drivers test. So she planted the plant and shes says that when spring comes, she will retry her drivers test	1	1		1																					
2314	4	"In the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with a paragraph with Saeng vowing she will take the test again in the spring. Minfong used this paragraph because it means never give up, even if you fail the first time. For example, Saeng just failed her drivers test but after buying the Hibiscus and taking deeper into things she realized she shouldn�t give up."	1	2		2																					
2315	4	The author concludes with this sentence for emphasis. It takes Saeng�s mind off of the flower and she focuses on her test. By waiting until next spring to take the test it gives her something to look forward to. This statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do. The author ends on a good note explaining this, The last paragraph is also a break from the rest of the story and from what Saeng�s was just doing. It is Saeng�s last and final thoughts.	2	2		2																					
2316	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph I think to say that when the hibiscus start to grow back she will be back at what she started. I think that is why because she says �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again.�	0	0		0																					
2317	4	The author concludes the story with a paragraph so the people reading the story would actually read it and not guess how the story is goin to go.	0	0		0																					
2318	4	The authors conclusion in the story explains that after all that team work and handwork you should keep that flow going each year even though something might have changed.	0	0		0																					
2319	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to create a feeling of hope. Saeng had a bad, from failing the test to her deep feeling of loss, @CAPS1 after finding the hibiscus and planting it she seemed to be enlightened, while as she missed her home land but still had the memories, which was comforting to her. She shows determination, because she declares she will take that test again, and seems to have more confidence in herself. The author adds that saeng will take the test again in the spring. When looking at archetypes, spring is time of new beginning and life. When the hibiscus is budding(being reborn), she will take the test. It will be a new, better start for saeng too.	2	3		3																					
2320	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test.	2	1		2																					
2321	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when Saeng was saying this to herself, she made a promise to not give up getting her license and the hibiscus makes her feel like she is at home again. In the text when the mother says, ""@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thats what matters.� when she says this it makes Saeng not sad because she knows that the hibiscus will remind her of the hibiscus at home and that gives her the power to want to try again in the spring."	2	2		2																					
2322	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think that the author includes this paragraph to show how persistant Saeng is. Saeng is persistant because she trys over and over again at this �test� and also she trys to get used to her new country. It demonstrates this in the story when it says the quote above. This quote shows that Saeng can try something and fail, then be determined to try and succeed again. Also in the story, Saeng has moved from one country to another. This is a huge jump and for her to be confident with herself is very persistant. The way the author concludes the story, with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� definitely portrays Saeng, the main character as a persistant person, and that is the purpose of the quote.	2	2		2																					
2323	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he want the ourtose to think about what he said to want to read more. For example I was reading a book that end in a quesiton and I wanted to read more of what the answer to the quesition is. Another example is that I was reading another book and that was ending in a stentment So I want to read anther book that they have but they don't have One so I don't know how the story ended. Thats why the end stories like that so they can make you read another book with the ending.	1	1		1																					
2324	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. The author wanted to convey a sense of hope to show the growth of her character, and to show how thing are  going to change. In the last paragraph when she vows that she will take that test again it gives you a sense that everything will be okay. Earlier in the story she had been crying and missing her homeland the tone was troubled and sad. This last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful. Even though she failed the test she is still going to try again. The author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grow. Saying that she will try again shows how much stronger determed she is lastly, she had the story end with that paragraph to foreshadow what is to come.The geese coming back and the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding all show a change in the seasons. This represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on.	3	3		3																					
2325	4	The author concluded the story with that message is because If you think about it. if not that seems all the whole story and leavs a opening for a requal. It's ovious that whole point of the story is to make you think.	1	1		1																					
2326	4	I think the author add this paragraph because it a sign of a new start for her. Because she has hard time no doesn�t main the she will alway have hard times.	0	0		0																					
2327	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because It meant a lot to Saeng. Saeng failed her driving test and scared to tell her mother that she also spent nineteen dollars for �Dok Faeng-noi which was a flower/plant they had back at home. For example, �As Saeng walks home after failing her driver�s test, she sees a familiar plant.� The plant Saeng saw meant a lot to her mother. �@PERSON1 uttered a small cry of surprise and delight.� Dok faeng-nor� she said. �where did you get it.� That was a quote stating that her mother was excited to hear that. The story is concluded by that paragraph because after all saeng went through her mother was glad she bought it. �It�s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng- noi,� she finally said. �I�m glad you got it.�	1	1		1																					
2328	4	"Authors sometimes use intisting sentences as there concludy sentence that you @MONTH1 have a hard time understding. In the story �Winter Hibiscus� The author concludes her story by saying �when they come back. Saeng vowed siletly to herself, iN the sprng, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author says this to show that Saeng is not ready to gardam yet and needs to lean more. The mother is verry disapointed in the daghter for buying a plant that is very expensve and shows her inexperience in that buying thigs because of your fodings is wrong. This is showed wha they say �I paid over Nineteen dollars for it."" � You what?� She also, says � @CAPS1 facing. Na where did you gott that"" showing her suprise of the expensve beutiful plant. Authes use those paragraphs and sentences to show or recap the story. The Author of �winter hibiscus� @CAPS2 her story with the paragraph because Saeng shuld Not hav boght the plant bascal a hav emotions and that she shall try agan Next year to not mess up."	1	1		1																					
2329	4	The  author  of  the  passage  ends  the  story  with this  statements  to  creates curiosity. Thi creates curiosity through writing for the spring and the geese to return.Spring is the beginning for many creatures on  the earth  therefore ,Saeng  is  trying  to  start  over  because  she  must  wait  for  the spring. The hibiscus reinforces the feeling of a new beginningin that each year new bad grow just  like  she can have a second chance. Saeng  waits for  the  spring  because she knows that is when every thing else creates new life so Saeng must wait till then to get her new beginning	2	2		2																					
2330	4	I think the reason why the author ended the story with that paragraph was because that will be the time she thinks she will be ready to retake the driver�s test. Before she made that move she was dishearted because she failed the test. Maybe she picked the spring time because that gives her time to get herself together and practice between them and the spring time 	1	1		1																					
2331	4	The author includes this scentence, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show her determination. She is determined to pass the test. Even if she is facing problems adapting to @LOCATION1 she wents to sucseed here. So she will wait a year and then try again when she is better prepared.	1	1		1																					
2332	4	From the story of the girl just moved from Vietnam to United @ORGANIZATION1. It will be hard for the girl to understand anything and anything can bring her memory back about Vietnam. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she did fail the test and see wants to see the hibiscus is budding. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng said it to her mother. Her mother actually understand why it happen and she will let Saeng keep the hibiscus because it will make Saeng feel better. Saeng miss Vietnam a lot and will like to try her best to overcome obstacles.	2	2		2																					
2333	4	The author concludes this paragraph because he wants to make it more clearer so the readers would understand It more. And so he could, make it better to stand out. 	0	0		0																					
2334	4	The author finished off the story with that paragraph because the paragraph is saying that overtime when she is adapted well to every thing she will be able to take the test, so that�s why she says ��and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,�� �@CAPS1 that all it needs is time. Time to get warm and time to grow. Also the paragraph is well thought out and relates to the entire story. So she concluded with a great paragraph that made a lot of sense in relationship with the story.	1	1		1																					
2335	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by Minfong Ho, Ho concludes the story with the paragraph due to the fact the flower represents her hapiness from her home. The flower symbolizes the past and comfort, once Saeng began to dig the ""winter hibiscus"" In, ""she could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now,"" All of Saeng�s sense were beginning to return; she was happy, likewise, the author uses the geese to explain the comfort of Saeng. The country around her began to feel like home. She became familiar with her surroundings. Many references to home was made throughout the piece because home is a place of comfort and happiness. therefore, Saeng would gain more confidence, which explans the reason @CAPS1 Ho concluded with that sentence."	3	2		3																					
2336	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, iN the spring, wheN the @CAPS1 melt and the geese RetuRN and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� means to the author kinda like the meaning to life. That if you mess up its okay just try again and do better.	1	1		1																					
2337	4	She concludes that paragraph with the story because she realy wants the people to realize that she is and and is always having fun. Also that she love where she at. Shes making in the world and she loves wathing flower, �geese return and this hibiscus is budding� that show that her favorite thing to do  that she loves is flowers.	0	0		0																					
2338	4	"The author concludes this story this way to go over again the important things in the story. �I will  take that test again,� This is the test that she had failed that day. The test that she failed tested her memory of her home. Her old country was so important to her. The part in the quote,� when they come back.... when the show me it and the geese return,� is referring to when she says,� She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become � almost familiar to her. Like the geese,� She is saying that everything in this country she is starting to get used to like the geese that fly south every winter.� When she uses ""and this hibiscus is budding,"" she is saying how she will remember all the things she has forgotten when she moved over here to this country.� When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center �just as she had known it would feel. This whole statement is basically saying  that she is starting to forget things in her country as this country becomes more familiar but when the geese return meaning in the @DATE1 then she will remember again and she will take that test again of her knowledge and pass."	1	2		2																					
2339	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he/she is trying to put across the message that the plant shows a symbol of new beginings which is a symbol of saeng�s vowe. Also in the story caring for the plant teaches saeng responsablity in obtaining her license by care for the plant it will teach her patients and that she needs to learn from mistakes made.	1	1		1																					
2340	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it shows she is not willing to give up on her new life. �I-I failed the test,� Saeng had failed her drivers test and was very unhappy. She also disliked her new home. �She was still too shaky to say at home� she missed her old home and she really wanted to give up. After talking to her mother, it renewed her hopes so the author uses this paragraph to signify that she still have hope in the end and when she is ready she will try again. �When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again.�  	2	1		2																					
2341	4	The author concludes this in the story to show tone. The paragraph shows how Saeng was determined to try again a pass. This teaches a lesson to the reader. Lessons to try your hardestand don�t give up. The last paragraph ends the story with a sence of curiosity. It makes you want to no more or if she passes.	1	1		1																					
2342	4	I think that the concluding paragraph means after everything   else   important and what is meant to happen happens then she will take the test because its  basically the last  thing has to happen and I think she will pass it because it meant to happen.	1	1		1																					
2343	4	I belive that saeng made that silent vow to herself was because after the plant goes though the hard winter and once everything goes back to how she likes it and the plant starts budding again, that that kind of represents her hardtime with moving so if this plant that she loves so much can make it through it then she can too.	1	1		1																					
2344	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with  the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because it emphasizes Saeng pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes Saeng�s resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads �And besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.� This excerpt demonstrates Saeng�s love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news �I-I failed the test� @CAPS1 attention instantly was drawn to the flower and her mother could only be good. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is Saeng�s source of stength as it�s the only thing she knows in the united states. Saeng wants to show the same resolve on her test that the  flower shows in the harsh winter."	2	2		2																					
2345	4	The author concludes the story with the afore mentioned paragraph to represent the connection between the return of the hibiscus�s bids, and the return of Saeng�s resolve. In the photograph for question #@NUM1, the hibiscus flower is out of place, as if it doesn�t belong similar to Saeng. The hibiscus represented the link to Saeng�s past, as portrayed when the author writes: �Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world.� The hibiscus was native to her homeland, and by helping Saeng to remember her past, she began to cope with the present, and later the future, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.	2	2		2																					
2346	4	By this quote, the author is explaining that Saeng will eventually be ready for her test. When the geese return, they're ready to return From their migration and when the hibiscus is budding, it is ready to turn into a beautiful flower. Saeng believes that in the spring, since the flower and the geese are ready, she too will be ready.	2	1		2																					
2347	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because the narrarator is now willing to accept and adapt to her new environment like the flower and the flower would do. Geese like the warm and not the cold so they are flying south for the winter. Saeng�s �comfort tone� is in @LOCATION1 where she has many childhood memories; including her grandmother and the hibiscus flower. She is used to the flower being in a warm environment. So, when the geese come back in the spring and when the flower blossoms again, she will be ready to adapt to @CAPS1 life more and take her drivers test. The geese and the hibiscus flower are a symbolic memory of her old home in @LOCATION1 which she misses very much. After these things come to try and adapt to @CAPS1 ways of life. 	3	2		3																					
2348	4	Saeng would return to her homeland.	0	0		0																					
2349	4	In the passage �winter hibiscus� the author uses this phrase in the last paragraph �when they came back, Saeng vowes silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. I believe she concluded this story with these words she change because she is saying to you in that means when the birds flewaway. Even the bird seasons would be back like always. An example of this is when she says the birds eased into the hibiscus. Mingled because the last paragraph thinking that she would stay again next season and keys very what she likes to do. This what I get out as the last paragraph are the story �winter hibiscus� as what it means to me.	2	1		2																					
2350	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph is that the author is showing  that when it becomes spring and the geese are budding she said silently to her self that she is going  to take the permit again. 	0	0		0																					
2351	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show saeng�s determination to survive and be happy in her new home. Although she isn�t happy with her purchase she is trying to make it seem more homey. When  she says �will take that test again�she shows how she wants her surroundings to be comfortable. By ending with this paragraph it also shows a strongness in seasons. As it saeng will start over and try again with her life. She is content for the moment but is planning to please herself and her mother again in the spring. This paragraph also serves as a promise to discover a new way to live and make friends. The  plant is like a symbol of how she is going to change she is going to investigate and pass her own test proving she diserves to be happy and make herself feel at home.	2	2		2																					
2352	4	The author concluded this paragraph in the story because it was showing that there are geese that hang around the garden around the spring time.	0	0		0																					
2353	4	The author in this story explaynes how hard some changes can be. The author also explayns how family and object frome home such as the flower can be comforting. The meaning of the story is to show one of the author expierances in life.	1	1		1																					
2354	4	I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it wasn�t it for the little girl and she wasn�t going to give up on planting flower and that when the spring come and the snow had melt she was going to plant some more flower and see how they will do during the spring even though that it didn�t work as well as the winter season she did let her stop her I think the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesn�t work keep on trying maybe something different will happen.	0	0		0																					
2355	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with, �When they come back take that test again. �She does this to show that she still has hope, and won�t just give up. She went through a lot when she moved, and seemed to have  a sense of depression in the story. after all her sadness within the story, she finally gets the energy back to tell herself, keep trying. �@CAPS1 I will take that test again.� (shows hope).�And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� She is obviously upset because the plant reminds her of home. as a conclusion, I thought  that it was a very wise choice to end the passage with a positive addittude.  	2	2		2																					
2356	4	I think the author ends the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One reason is because It leaves you knowing that Saeng will never give up tring. Another reason is that something as simple as a flower can encourage someone to keep going even if they have nothing to go for. Saeng says that flower is something so important, that working harder will encourage her to keep doing the best she can. The author leaves you with this sentence because it is very powerful and brings Saeng courage.  	2	1		2																					
2357	4	The author concludes the story with this because she failed the test already and wanted to pass it nexttime So she doesn't make her mother dissapointed in her.	1	1		1																					
2358	4	I think what the narrator means by saying this she wants to come back when everything is beautifle again. She wants to WAIT FOR ALL OF THE SNOW TO MELT AND GEESE TO RETURN SO SHE CAN SEE ALL THE COLORS OF THE FLOURS AND IF SHE PASSES HER TEST THIS TIME, SHE WILL GET TO DRIVE PAST ALL THE FLOURS. THATS WHAT I THINK THE CHARECTER MEANS iN THiS STORY.	0	0		0																					
2359	4	The author of this story ends the story with this paragraph because it explains how Saeng will not give up, just as the hibiscus does not. Earlier in the story, it explains how the winter hibiscus does not die. In the paragraph, when it says, the snows melt, this means that the seasons will keep going, just as Saeng should keep going and trying. Also when the author says and the geese return, this means that the geese will keep coming back just as Saeng should keep trying to take the test.	2	2		2																					
2360	4	I belive the author used these lines in the last paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 he realy liked it.	0	0		0																					
2361	4	I think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story.The author could of wanted to show more details in the story.	0	0		0																					
2362	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how she will start over by retaking the test, just as the hibiscus will start over by budding new flowers. Saeng shows us how she will try to overcome the obstacles she must face, just like the hibiscus flower and geese will overcome the winter. In the story, the author makes the hibiscus represent the way to adjust to the changes in life. In a way, the winter hibiscus represents Saeng because the flower is adapting to circumstances, the circumstance being winter. Just like the hibiscus flower, Saeng must overcome her obstacles of being in a new country, and retaking her drivers exam.	2	2		2																					
2363	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story. In the my opinion the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story in order to show Saeng is committed to adjusting  to her new home and to leaving her old one. For example, in the story Saeng was unable to say �I mean, not like the kind we had at home.� without bursting into tears. This illustrates her sorrow and inability to let go of her past.	1	2		2																					
2364	4	The author could have finished the story with that paragraph for many reasons. He/she probably finished with the paragraph to show that Saeng cared about adapting to her new place and was not a failure or quiter. The author also probably finished the story this way to show that Saeng was determined for success and to make her mother happy. This is why the author finished the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2365	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is given a small glimmer of hope by the winter hibiscus. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland, Vietnam, which pleases her. Also, the fact that the hibiscus she purchases can survive winter, unlike the hibiscus of her homeland, symbolizes Saeng�s determination to adapt to her new country. The future of the hibiscus symbolizes Saeng�s survival and adaptation to her new country, which will include her retaking her driving test.	2	2		2																					
2366	4	The author concludes her story with this statement for many reasons. First the Hibiscus will be strong again when the wind stops blowing. therefore, Saeng will be strong too. Also, Saeng is giving herself time to adjust and get used to her new surroundings. She is setting a real goal for herself. Saeng is identifieng with the flower. It gives her comfort, and brings back valuable memories of the things she loved and the things that made her happy, like her home country, and her grandmother.	1	2		2																					
2367	4	The author of this story concludes it with this paragraph to show Saeng�s  determination .  I  say this hibiscus in  the  story the sees  the  plant and it joyed to see it and is so happy but the reminders doing her grandmother �s  hair she  tries.  She snow this as a test for herself . She  want to see if she could be on and try not will on the past . When she  isn�t  home she said � I failed the test .� This snows melt she want is to move on but it hasn�t  as  easy as she hope it to be. So when the as this hibiscus the shows life this paragraph it shows that Saeng is trying  to move on and she is different  to  a English her seal.	1	2		2																					
2368	4	In the story, I believe Saeng is sad because she misses her home and the hibiscus flower. She ends the story off well because she can now have a since of peace with herself by waiting to take the test again. I believe that�s why she ended the story like she did so she doesn�t leave herself worried or angry. She can turn a negative attitude into a positive one when she says she will retake the test when the geese return and hibiscus is budding.	2	1		2																					
2369	4	The author concludes with this sentence because it shows that Saeng is going to try to adapt to her new home. He lets you know that Saeng is not gonna grieve and be sad anymore, but she will adapt and continue on with her life. The author adds this: �I mean, not like the kind we had @NUM1at-�. This is when Saeng has just come home and talked to her mother and she is very sad because she thought about old memories at her old home, but by adding the last statement of the story it shows that Saeng has decided to move on with life and no longer be sad. She has set a goal to accept it. This is the reason for the author to conclude his story like he does.	2	2		2																					
2370	4	Many authors end their storys in different ways. But Minfong Ho ended hers with almost a saying One reason she ended her story this way was she kinda revealed what would happen to Saeng in the future. Like in the end it says �I will take that test again.� This lets the reader know that she, the author, might write another story about Saeng but it is when she takes the test again. A second example is showing that Saeng is strong and beautiful but will try again. This is show when the author said �when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� see she said this hibiscus which is referring to Saeng. Without some of these writings techniques and hints we might not know if there will be a sequal and what might happen.	2	2		2																					
2371	4	They author must have put this in the story to show change. For all giving things is we give we do e them we replemise the author. People dont think about the small damages, there nuste comrade with the big changes. The small ones count the turnig sioteero & I have to bind as for. On top of that the old anges to drive. We all go through harsh big & small, but we need to over come them all	0	0		0																					
2372	4	This is a very important paragraph for the narrator to put in the story. For instance, Saeng is saying that her new home with her flowers is more important than school and a test. And, saeng doesn�t have many friends go see at school but her hibiscus will remind her of all of her old friends she made. Saeng is simply stating to herself that once everything is back to normal or the way she wants to she it then she can take that test again. In conclusion, the narrator used this paragraph to let us know how saeng feels.	1	1		1																					
2373	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it concludes, and wraps up the story. It shows the relationship between nature, adapting, and how this all calmed her down after failing the test.	1	1		1																					
2374	4	The author concludes this story with a sentence like this because at the end of winter into spring the snow will melt and the trees and flowers will blosom into different colored flowers. After all the flowers had blosomed the leaves had come out and then the pollin had found the right kind of trees . At the end of @DATE2 into fall the leaves start to die and change color then the leaves will fall off. Then it snows all over again.	0	0		0																					
2375	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, When the snows melt ant the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� because it shows That Saeng isn�t going to stay down. It shows That The hibiscus will overcome winter, like Saeng�s mother says,�'�but its strong enough to make it Through the cold months here, This winter hibiscus That�s what matters.� This symbolizes Saeng overcoming not only failing The driver�s test, but also moving to @LOCATION1. She isn�t The same as she was back home, but she�s strong enough to get Through This change in her life. Also, taking The test in the spring symbolizes starting over, when everyThing is new, and she has overcome her winter. This ending paragraph is so important because it shows Saeng�s promise to herself That she will get past The challenges in front of her, and @CAPS1 to come. When Saeng says �...When the snows melt...� it symbolizes The time in her life when her failures will become good again. She will take The test with a new out look on her life. The author concludes The story with This paragraph because it shows That Saeng isn�t going to stay down.	3	3		3																					
2376	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. �Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscun is budding, then I will take that test again. Minpong Ho did so because she failed the test. Saeng failed to fine the fine�toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding.	1	1		1																					
2377	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s outlook on the future. It is a fitting conclusion, drawing from numerous elements in the story, and it shows how Saeng has grown. Saeng refers to �When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� In this phrase she shows a growing acceptance and even an affection for her new homeland. The geese are �familiar to Saeng now � despite her thinking of them as �strange before.� The hibiscus is a piece of her past, adapted to fit her current situation. Saeng�s vow that she will �take that test again� in the spring, �When the snows melt��etc. This shows that despite losing so much - her home, her grandmother, her way of life - Saeng is still determined to make the best of her situation. She plans on passing her driving test come spring, no matter what. The concluding paragraph is a fitting way to wrap up the story. It was how the thrends of Saeng�s past and her present are entwined , and displays her attitude towards the future. With its optimistic words the final paragraph nearly ties up the mood of optimism amidst regret. The author�s wording was very well done.	3	3		3																					
2378	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story it says ""I will take that test again."" So she's trying to say she will she how much she have adjusted to changes in life. In the story it also states ""when they come back"" That concludes that when the flower's come back next season. She will she how much she reminber about her homeland, her grandma and the good things."	1	1		1																					
2379	4	The reason  why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because they wanted the reader to know there will be another story that will be made up. Also to show that Saeng was not happy that the snow melted and the geese return and the hibiscus was budding.	1	1		1																					
2380	4	Now that she knows a lot about plants the narrator makes it seem like the girl is interested in @CAPS1.R.@CAPS1. The new world and different plants that bloom and look so beautiful in the season so the way I see it is that the girl really enjoys the plants and the characteristic to me I say she is an adventurous girl who likes to explore new worlds and see what is out there to be explained.	0	0		0																					
2381	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome. What the @CAPS1 �In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� It means she�ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she�s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it.	1	1		1																					
2382	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The first reason is to show that Saeng is determined young girl. By vowing to take the �test� again, she shows she is determined and not giving up. Another reason is because the author wanted to ampasize the importance of the idea of Saeng personality.	1	1		1																					
2383	4	Minfong Ho concluded the story with this because it shows Saeng�s determination to pass the drivers test. The fact that she failed it made her feel bad, and brought out feelings of homesickness as did the familiar plant, but in this final paragraph she vows that she will overcome all her challenges of being in an unfimiliar place and pull herself together to accomplish her goal as did the winter hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2384	4	The author included this sentence in the paragraph because Saeng was a very determined girl. She would keep trying till she got it right. No matter how long or hard it would be she would get it done. Just like from the picture of the Hibiscus flower next to the highway. It certainly woked out of place, but it would do anything to survive. Being strong at times when you can only depend on yourself is hard to do, but Saeng is determined from her loss and the perfection of the Hibiscus flower.	2	2		2																					
2385	4	In the concluding statement Saeng states that �when they come back In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The author concludes the story with this passage because she is using the hibiscus as an example of survival. The hibiscus isfrom another place like her, and she is using it to represent her well being in the new place. In a way she is saying , If the hibiscus survives this winter, than so will I. I believe she uses this as a conclusion to depict her unsure nature towards her new home.	2	3		3																					
2386	4	I believe the author uses this as the last paragraph because it tells of how Saeng wants to overcome and be strong even though. She misses her home. For example Saeng believed that since she cried when she saw the hibibiscus plant she failed and she believes she will get stronger over time.  	1	1		1																					
2387	4	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower�s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower�s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages	3	3		3																					
2388	4	The  reason  the author was inspired was because of the flower. The flower had the ability to survive harsh winters and adapt to and new environments. She decides that she was going to over comes its obstacles just as the flower over comes its obstacles every winter.	2	1		2																					
2389	4	Memory,promise,life-all are ideas that explain why the author concludes the  story with this paragraph.Memories is one  idea that helps explain why the author concludes this story  with  this paragraph because saeng misses her old life and country.Promise is another idea because saeng makes a vow that once spring comes again she will take the test again.Life is another idea because saeng brought the flower and planted soit can live once spring has come and she said  the n she will  retake the test. Memories, promise, and life help explain why the author conclude the story with this paragraph. Memories will come back in the spring along with the promises she has made and the that wants to start and saeng is doing this by pla nting the hibiscus which brings back a lot of her memories from her life	2	2		2																					
2390	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it had gotten colder and all the plants and flowers were going to die.	0	0		0																					
2391	4	Resons I think the author concludes the saying at the top. I think he concludes the becus she was vary eger on passing the test. She told her self and she vowed to take the test again when the geese return and the snow melsts. Another reson I think the author concludes this is becus she faled it the first time and it is a big thing for her and she is vary eger on passing it. That is why I think the author added this to the story.	1	1		1																					
2392	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�, Saeng had failed her drivers test and as she is walking home she spies a flower that reminds her of what once her home. She buys the flower and returns to her new home to her mother who is working in the garden. They decide to plant the flower in the garden, and when the flower was planted, a flock of geese fly over head, Saeng then realizes that everything is familier to her now, when everything was quite strange to her. She concludes the story saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will take the test again. She says that the flower will be buckling which means blooming or growing, and she will have been grown and familiar to everything then, so she will be ready for the test when the geese as ready to come home and the hibiscus is ready to bloom	2	2		2																					
2393	4	The author does this because they are comparing to the plant. The author does this because when the plant starts to bloom then the character�s confidence will come back. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it gives the story some meaning.	1	1		1																					
2394	4	The Author concludes this story With the @CAPS1 paragraph to emphasize the story and make it seem more interesting as to make the reader want the story to keep going on to find out what happens next.	1	1		1																					
2395	4	I think this Author put this last paragraph in this story is to show everyone how determined she is to pass this test and how much it means to her to do it so that is what I think Why the Author Would put this in the story 	1	1		1																					
2396	4	The  author  concludes  the  story  of  paragraph  with the paragraph because it show the connection of nature and the girl. The paragraph says,��when the snow  melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then  I will take that test again�(No @NUM1).In spring when all of these events take place. Spring is the  sign  of  life  and  birth  or  renewal. The geese come back. They are �renewed� in a symbolic sense. When the snow melts you can see the grass again which is a sign of life. When plants bud they are born. The  character  decides  when  nature  is symbolically reborn  and  renewed she  will start again just like nature.	2	3		3																					
2397	4	he concludes the sTory  with his paRagRaph because he wanted To say That he was going To Take The Test again when it was not The winTeR @CAPS1 and show how saeng vowed to heRself By saying that he oR she will take The Test again when it is not winTeR because even @CAPS2 the Test was not passed in winteR and could have been passed duRing when TheRe snow melted in the gRound	1	1		1																					
2398	4	In the story the author included that concluding paragraph because if you had read the rest of the story you would know that the person was talking about when she comes back that she wanted to take the test again because it would be such nicer weather then it was the first time she took it, another reason why I believe the author added this conclusion paragraph at the very end of the novel is to show the reader if they really did understand the novel and what she was really going for in the novel. So the author first wanted to make shore the reader would understand the ending of the book better with that conclusion paragraph at the end. These are the reason why I think the author added that concluding paragraph at the very end of that novel.	0	0		0																					
2399	4	Because they wanted to get it done with so they made the end like the first part of the story I like the part when the birds came back they got some of the flower come back to them.	0	0		0																					
2400	4	Saeng and her mother have to be determined to try their best in order to survive. Saeng and her mother has been thourgh a lot and when she failed the @CAPS1 test, she was more depressed than before, The author concludes this story with this paragraph to give readers the thought oF how it is to be determined to adapt and survive in a different place and though Saeng and her mother are away from their homeland they still enjoy the things they did in Vietnam, like the flowers, and the hot peppers and bitter melons, her friends disagree with the taste but it doesnt stop her from enjoying what she loves most.	2	2		2																					
2401	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she will not stop trying and one day she will pass that test. She made a vowe to herself that is show determination to overcome. It @MONTH1 also make us want to read make and find out if she test her vowe and if she passed the test. For example it ends in �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibsiscus is budding, then I will return and take the test again.	2	1		2																					
2402	4	The Author concluded the story like this because she had another view of Saeng. He would think that every season that she would be in a different mood @CAPS1 that the garden would change so that Saeng mom would alway be out side for every season.	0	0		0																					
2403	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph because she is proving how something from a memory can make someone determined. For example, saeng failed her driver�s test but upon reaching the hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her old home. Also, while she is planting the plant, she sees the geese with a new familiarity. This combined makes her determined to complete her test because having two reminders of both homes, it comforts her to know that she can adapt easily and treasure her memories as well.	3	2		3																					
2404	4	he was saying that you should not give up and that you should keep trying like the plants in the spring time.	1	1		1																					
2405	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because she is making a promise to herself to take the test again so she can pass it. She will do it when it is spring with the hibiscus is budding. She need to take the test and start driving. I think that is a good thing to when people vowed thing to themself.	1	1		1																					
2406	4	He is referring to the lifestyle of Saeng and the stuff they do. And what the area is like weather wise.	0	0		0																					
2407	4	The author decided to finish the story with that phrase to show that she will wait for her next year and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and do all this over again. She will be waiting for it and prove that she can do it one more time and that she is used to live there now.	0	0		0																					
2408	4	the author conclude this story like that to show a new beginning in the spring. Like how flowers bloom and bud in spring she will become a new better person. that why the author conclude the story like this.	1	1		1																					
2409	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will try the test again and get a fresh new start.  Also I think that its showing the reader if you fail something the first time don�t be afraid to go back and try it again. I also think that the hibiscus symbolizes her because she failed the test in the winter and doesn�t like what shes in. But in the spring when the hibiscus has buds on it shes going to have a fresh start on the test and the flower will have a new environment to survive in.	1	2		2																					
2410	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because it leaves you to interpret and decide. It doesn�t come out  and tell you what the test was for or even if she passed it, that�s for you to decide. It also leaves you wondering what is going to happen until then. The ending to the story can be anything you want it to be, it is up for interpretation. To different people it could mean different things.	1	1		1																					
2411	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because that paragraph says when she is going to try to take the test and make changes in her changing life. For example she is sad in the story because she failed the test and want to go home. If she passes in the spring she might try to make changes and live here. This is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2412	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is Finally comfortable with her new �home.� After the passage is mostly a reflection of Saeng�s old life, it ends this way to signify that she has become accustomed to her new way of life. For example, it says �in the spring, and the geese return�� that shows that she is now used to the geese and the nature of her new world. The author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release. Saeng had so many memories locked inside her old life, that she couldn�t grasp new ones in her new home. The authors use of this paragraph is a good way to close out the story because it lets the reader feel the relaxed scene of the birds flying away; Saeng escaping  her pain and becoming  a real part of her new world.  	2	3		3																					
2413	4	This last paragraph reveals something special to the reader. Saeng was given new hope winter mothers understanding and the hibiscus plant. She felt hopeless, miserable and incomparable upon seeing the hibiscus that reminded her of her homeland. When she came home, however, seeing the roots of the plant buried in the ground gave her new determination. The flower represents her. It adapted to be able to survive in cold weather, or hard times, in Saeng's case. The roots are her past and although they are buried, they are not forgotten. The actual flower represents a new life for Saeng in a new country .The author, Minfong Ho, gave personification or human�izing to non-living things to the story. This is why the author used the last paragraph then why she did.	3	2		3																					
2414	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph inorder to show Saeng�s determination. It is also relating the drivers test to the hibiscus plant. It is saying that when everything else starts coming to life, she will also accomplish something. She needs the motivation of her surroundings to push her. Throughout the story, Saeng is affected by her surroundings. For example, when she�s in the greenhouse, it takes her back to her childhood, �It was like walking into another world. A hot, most world exploding with greenery.... Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back to into her childhood world.�	2	2		2																					
2415	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" Saeng finds comfort in the plant after she failed her test. The plant reminds her of home and connects her with her past experiances. Even though she failed the test the first time she feels that if she studies and trys again she can pass. This connects to the Hibiscus because in the winter the plant dies but then come spring its pretty and blossoms again. Saeng feels a connection with the plants rebirth and feels she can start over again to and do well on the test. That is why the author includes the paragraph that Saeng vowes to take the test again when the spring comes and the hibiscus blossoms."	2	2		2																					
2416	4	"The @CAPS1 why the authoR concludes the story saying, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRselF, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese REtuRn and this bibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The authoR ended it like that, because Saeng basically saying time will come FoR heR  to take that test and she will past it with belieF in heRselF,"	1	1		1																					
2417	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph as a way to say that in due season she will take the test that she failed in the belief that the hibiscus will help her to overcome the obstacles. I believe that she she bought the plant when she failed the test, that she hope that with the blossoming of the plant, I will give her a time table as to when she is ready to try again.	1	2		2																					
2418	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is a meaningful summary of the events in the story. Everything that happed to Saeng  while she was at the florizd  is summed upinto  something resembling vengeance. The whole reason that Saeng was sad in the first place was that she failed her driving test. In the final paragraph, she vows to take the test again when the hibiscus buds. The hibiscus that Saeng  bought will begin budding in the spring, when the snows melt. The last paragraph of the story gives roem for Saeng to dealhtith her nostalgiaover the winter season. Finally, the  geese that fly south make Saeng feel sad, but they light a spark within her she tells herself that she will take the driving test again when the geese return, when the hibiscus buds, and when the snows melt. 	2	2		2																					
2419	4	In the last paragraph they trying to express what is coming. When winter is over spring will come which means the hibiscus will come back and it will be like home. Also the geese will return and because of that she will take the quiz again. To her it�s like starting all over and hopefully she will pass. Also she loves the hibiscus and seamce thats back maybe she will do so much beter. Overall a new time is coming.  	1	1		1																					
2420	4	"I think the author of �Winter Hibiscus� finished with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, �because it is showing us the importance of the plant and how it will help her pass. It also symbolizes that when the plant buds and fights all the obstacles to survive, then she will beat the obstacles to past her driving test. For example, in the story it says ""When the snows melt and then geese return� the author is relating thats to Saeng and her struggle to pass her test with these struggle in surive the winter. It also says �Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive I was etches against the evening sky, slowly seeing into the distance�. This quote is saying she will rise to her challenge, and overcome it. All in all, this quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is holding then I will take that test again�, because it is showing the similar struggles between the flower, Saeng and the geese to overcome their challenges and finish what thing started."	3	3		3																					
2421	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has meaning. The author is saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance she too, will get hers. For example, the geese will get to return, the hibiscus will get it's chance to bud and she will get her chance to take her drivers test. I know this because Saeng�s mother starts talking about how great the plant will be in the spring. She even says, �But its strong enough to make it through the cold months�. This indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance. That is why the story ends with that sentence.	2	2		2																					
2422	4	Why the author concluds the story with ths paragraph because its telling the seasons and how they change and how they come and go and they start of with a new season then its something different. An I think thats why the title of this story was called Winter Hibiscus cause after spring is winter & when it was spring they have all the nice beautiful flower thats smell good. An when spring gone its winter so all the plants had died out they not going to be the same how they used to be.	1	1		1																					
2423	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� by @CAPS1 Ho, Saeng does not give up, she keeps trying. The author concludes the story with a small paragraph that has an extraordinary meaning. ��in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� by saying this, Saeng shows to never give up, to give new things a fair chance, and to always remember her homeland. The author ended the story in such an inspiring way because it strengthens the theme. There is a lot to be learned from only a few words.	2	2		2																					
2424	4	The author chose to end the story with the final paragraph for several reasons. Saeng states that she will retake her driving test in the spring. Archetypically, spring symbolizes a new start or new opportunity. Ending the story with this archetype shows that later on, Saeng has a new chance to succeed at her test and also to make the best of being in @LOCATION1 and adapt to her new life. When she buys the hibiscus plant, she remembers her old home and all the wonderful memories she has of it. The plant seems to give her hope and the last paragraph of the story mentions the hibiscus. This shows that having the hibiscus around will give her hope of passing her test and also of adjusting to @LOCATION1 while remembering her old home in Vietnam	3	3		3																					
2425	4	The author concludes the sentence on the end to state when the plants start over growing and the geese come back, she will try again. For example, the plants have to grow their pedals back and the geese have to make their home and find food again. The author is saying she will take the test again when the geese come back and the plants grow again.	1	1		1																					
2426	4	The author wrote the paragraph because she went back in side the house to get a dinner and because ain�t going to see the garden until the other day and because the winter come and she will not play outside anymore until the winter goes. Like she said �In the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. That quotation explain why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2427	4	I would have to say that the reason that the narrator ended with this is because it is kind of a solution if you think about it. And you don�t put the solution any whereelse but the end that is why she put it there.	0	0		0																					
2428	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example �the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by�, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2429	4	The author ended the story with that specific quote because it shows the grasp in understanding the beauty & marvels of nature. Saeng spent a lot of money to buy a distinct flower called dok faeng-nol. Saeng was taking a driver's test a liscence but was failing it, and during her test she found that plant. Ashamed that she failed the test, she still showed her mother the flower she found, which was not like the one at home. Her mother is pleased with the flowers and understands that Saeng failed her test. Her mother said about the flower, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That what matters that was a figurative speech that there's hope for Saeng to pass her test again when she her learned more refined and is ready to try again. And with the geese flying away for the winter and coming back in the spring signifies a fresh new start at success.	2	3		3																					
2430	4	The author concludes this way because when it gets warm and nice outside that they will go to take the test again cause it is to nosty outside now.	0	0		0																					
2431	4	It is actually a very powerful last statement, Even though she failed her driver�s test, she has realized that she will just have to keep being strong and be patient. Soon the geese will come back and the snow will melt, and she will �return� to take her test and will  be determined to pass. Saeng  bought the hibiscus to feel as if she were back in Vietnam, and felt as if it could fill that place in her heart were she misses it. �I paid nineteen dollars for  it�. She  says it like she was disappointed  in failing the  test but also that saying which is free back in vietnam was so expensive in the united states. A hibiscus flower is tropical so when it blooms in the spring will be when she becomes ready to give the test a second try.	3	2		3																					
2432	4	The author concludes the story with this endding because it shows that if the plant comes back and blooms then she will go back and take the test and try to pass this time. She knows that it is going to be tough for her to come back and pass this test but she knows she can do it just like she knows that the plant will fight through the winter and come back and bloom in the spring. This gives her confidence that she can pass this test if the plant can come through the tough winter that they are going through. As a result, this is why the author ended the story with that.	2	2		2																					
2433	4	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem, it�s adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example,  in lines @NUM1 Saeng�s thought�s are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saeng�s eyes now and swept over her �and� in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept.� This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because it�s gone. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said  �and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.� It means that she will overcome all that and move on."	3	3		3																					
2434	4	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that�s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story	1	1		1																					
2435	4	The author concludes the story with this because she is say that she is going to grow with the season chang. She is in a new country and just failed her drivers test. She feels down but the hibiscus reminds her of being back home. In the story @CAPS1 mother says �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake its strong enough to make it through the winter. I think that Saeng can relate to that because if the flower can make it in the winter tha she can make it in a new country.	2	2		2																					
2436	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus"", the auther finishes the story with this last paragraph, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is building, then I will take that test again. The auther finishes the story with that paragraph because in the beginning, Saeng had purchased hibiscus plant because it had reminded her of her hometown. (�Plants that she had not realized that she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world�) So she purchased it, but since there was bad weather at the time, Saeng had to get the plant back in time and plant it in the graden. But she failed setting if there on time. That is why it says �I will take that test again"". And she will take it again during the spring when the hibiscus blooms once again. That is why the auther finished the story with that paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2437	4	The author concludes the paragraph like this because it shows that she @MONTH1 not going to give up. I @MONTH1 this because she vowed silently to herself that she was going to take the test again during the spring, also, it was the aiudieres not the gains in old years seeds an ezing. In conclusion they one the reason why the author concludes the paragraph like this.	1	1		1																					
2438	4	"The story �Winter Hibiscus� is written by Minfong Ho. The author ended the story with this excerpt, �When they come back, �Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The reason for this is so she will have time to adjust. Saeng just needs a little comforting because all of this is new to her. This words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself, �Almost familiar to her now. Like geese.""

The paragraph says� When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding  then I will take that test again. ""The author ended the story with that paragraph because she was not in her comfort zone, she had move to a new country and missed everything like the flower and the Hibiscus. So she would wait until she felt at home and comfortable again to retake the test.

2441	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� so that the audience has something to think about, it gives the story a little more of a dramatic effect.	0	0		0																					
2442	4	The author concludes the story this way to show she will be alright, and remain determined. The way she speaks of future times shows confidence that she will make it till spring.

2446	4	I think the author concludes the story the way she did to show determination. I also believe that it symbolizes adaption, when the season changes, as will Saeng, she will take the test again. Everything will soon go back to normal and will adjust just like she will. Everything is �almost familiar to her now� (@NUM1).	1	2		2																					
2447	4	The author concludes with this ending because it because it gives hope. It is like a happy ending to a sad story. It is also her final thought for the story and a good end point.	1	1		1																					
2448	4	The author concludes this paragraph in the story because thats when she starts growing plants again & she wants to start over again	1	1		1																					
2449	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it explains that Saeng will try again once spring comes around. For example, �I failed the test,� (Ho) shows that saeng did fail the test, but got her mother a hibiscus to plant in her garden. Her mom feels bad about Saeng failing so she cooks her food to make her feel better and try to forget about failing. This is important because it makes saeng feel a sense of comfort and relief knowing she can take the test again in confidence.	1	2		2																					
2450	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes. Saeng vowed silently to herself. That shows she calm down already, she feels better with her new country. She feels the snows meet, the geese return, she says that she will take that test again. It shows one that she doesn�t feel bad with the test more. She knows that she has opportunity to take it again and does it better. She has a different feeling with her problem. She looks her new country with a different eyes. All things with her become better. These are some reasons explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph.	2	1		2																					
2451	4	The author concludes the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show that she will try again with a new start. When she see�s the flower the clerk tells her it is the hibiscus. The hibiscus brings back memories of her childhood. She then takes it home and shows the plant to her mother. Her mother replies with a �You what?� hearing her daughter tell her how much it is. With the hibiscus bringing something of importance she acquires more hope. By saying she will start once the flower has bloomed and the geese have returned, she means she will try again with a new and frash start.	2	1		2																					
2452	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s determination despite her sadness. She misses Vietnam, but she will take the test again next year. The author�s choice of words in the concluding paragraph convey a sense of hope and something to look forward to. In the story, Saeng is disapointed in herself for failing the test, but buying the plant helps her because it reminds her of home. The idea that Saeng is persistant and the hopeful tone of the story are expressed in this final paragraph.	1	2		2																					
2453	4	"The author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because it appeared to be an important thought to ""Saeng"" and it was basically the main cause of everything rather the main subject of the story. She also @MONTH1 possibly have concluded the story with that particular paragraph because that was her last and final thought, or memory of her previous life / lifestyle before there present place of living."""	0	0		0																					
2454	4	The author concludes the story with �In the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� because Saeng fails the test by spending her money on a big mac and not having enough for the type of flower her mother sent for. So since Saeng failed the test, she wants to take the test again and make her mother happy.	0	0		0																					
2455	4	 I believe that author ended the story with that sentence because it give a lifting feeling after the story was so sad. Saeng missed her homeland, was sad, used the flowers as relief, sad about her driving test and realy liked the plant. So the last sentence seemed to fit in as a confort zone to make the reader a bit more relieved. 	1	1		1																					
2456	4	The author concludes the story with these final lines to create a tone of hope that creates a theme. Final lines have a great impact for the reader because it is the last thing they read. In this story, Saeng refers to the time �when the shows me�. Here the snow is symbolic to the sorrow she has been facing because she left home. At one point in the story, �Saeng  brokedown and wept!� The spring is a time for archetypal rebirth. However, so the �show will melt� and her sorrow will go away. This creates a tone of hope for happy times in the future. Next, saeng  refers to the time of the hibiscus budding. The hibiscus represents a comforting connection to her old country. She referred to the plant as �yet another old friend�. If the hibiscus blooms, then her new life will also because she will be comforted to the point where she feels security. This creates a tone of hope for future comfort. The times ahead she speaks of are followed by a promise to take the test again despite her failure the first time. The author is using  the ??? of hope to ??? home that??? We overcome. She is showing optimism toward the spring and is willing to face a challenge. Therefore, he ????  that to make a hopeful home . ??? a life lesson of courage.	3	3		3																					
2457	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� ends the story with this paragraph because it reveals the importance of the Winter Hibiscus. In the story Saeng moves from Vietnam and feels very homesick. She fails her drivers test and is very upset. When she sees the familiar plant she is reminded of her home in Vietnam. The Winter Hibiscus reminds Saeng of fond memories with her grandmother and simple things such as her fine. Toothed buffalo-horn comb and the hibiscus hedge that would leave soft red petals in her well water. When seeing the familiar plant. �Saeng felt a shock recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. �This shows how important the hibiscus was to her. The author ended the story with that paragraph to show how the winter hibiscus is a comfort to Saeng and will encourage her to do better on her next driver�s test.	2	2		2																					
2458	4	After reading �Winter Hibiscus, I can tell that Saeng is a determined person, and likes nature. I can also tell that she is determined to pass the test. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the beginning of the story, Saeng fails her driving test. She walks home, and as she is walking, she comes across a familiar plant. This takes her to her childhood world. Have her not failed the test, she would have never walked home and come across the plant. The author didn�t want us to forget the reason she walked home. It would have never happened.	1	1		1																					
2459	4	The author concluds the story with this paragraph to show that next spring she will have anoter chane. The author shows that Saeng will relate to the blooms or the hybiscus plant and take the test again. The author does this to leave a clif haber and it shows there is more to Saeng�s life but it is still to come. In the story Saeng is trys to get used to change and that she is have a hard time. Her moter holes cheer her up but just like the winter comes. Saeng will Have next spring to take the divers test again.	1	2		2																					
2460	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph ""When they come back,� then I will take the test again because Saeng needs time just as the hibiscus to grow. Saeng didn't do well on a test but says she will try again after snow melts and the spring comes. After moving Saeng feels alone and wants to go back home but she feels in her heart that she can try given time. The hibiscus remines Saeng of the flower back in her home country this helps her see that she has to let go of her past and live in the now."	2	2		2																					
2461	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows saeng being mature about it and being confident knowing she can take it again. When it says � saeng vowed silently to herself she thought about everything and the phrase is almost like she is going to start over.	1	1		1																					
2462	4	The author concludes the story with a sentence about retaking her test when the geese are back and the hibiscus is budding because they each represent something else. The geese represent change because they change their environment in the winter just like Saeng changes her environment by going to the plant place. The hibiscus reminds her of home because at her home there are similar plants. The hibiscus budding represents a new life just like the one Saeng has to live in a new home. Overall, the sentence that the author era�s with is used to show @CAPS1 life as compared to the geese and hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2463	4	Saeng was happy when the snow was disappearing because she couldn�t wait for spring to come back to see the animals running around by her garden and seeing the beautiful geese flying in after they long & hard hibernation. So Saeng was excited to see everything grown back so she is guaranteed to pass the test this time	0	0		0																					
2464	4	 The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was waiting for the winter time to be over. After the winter time, Saeng going take a test again and she can plants the flower. Saeng really like this hibicus and she doesn't want it to die on winter time.	1	1		1																					
2465	4	"The author concluded this story with this paragraph because she wanted show how the flower gave the little girl strength. The girl was in a new place and back at home where she is from there are alot of beautiful flowers that she loved to look at and being in a new place that doesn't have these flowers really gets her down and has her upset. She misses her home so she is hurting and the only thing that sort of comforts her a little bit are the flowers. For example, the girl says, �It�s-it's not a real one...I mean, not like the kind we had at..."", here she stops because she is so upset that she can�t say home. The flower she has right now isn't real but when the real one blossom in the spring, seeing the flower will comfort her and give her confidence to retake the test."	2	2		2																					
2466	4	"The author�s conclusion explains her feels. The authors conclusion saids to me ""when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test"" again"", what means is that she is a newoman. For example, taking the test means that she will change. Also what it means is that she ready to take on new thing. For instance, the test to her is getting ready to take on a new thing. Thats what I got from the conclusion. "	1	1		1																					
2467	4	The author ends with this paragraph to show gthat Saeng had. Hope. It shows that there is still hope. The ending paragraph makes you  kind of create your own ending for Saeng. I like to imagine Saeng with a big garden next to her and and she passes the test.	1	1		1																					
2468	4	"I believe that the author concluded the story with this paragraph for several reasons. This final paragraph draws together and unites all the final paragraph on concluding idea. It tells us that in the spring when everything is coming to life Saeng will find the strength to take the test again. These central ideas expressed in thelast paragraph show how Saeng and her mother have adapted and that new things are started in the spring, as well as new possibilities. In the text it says, �I know"", her mother said quietly. �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. It�s flower aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus.� This means and represents that even though life is different here away from Saeng home they will adapt and survive in their own way."	2	2		2																					
2469	4	The author concludes the story the way she does because it shows that Saeng   needs to heal from the failing of the test before she can take it again. Saeng already knows that she  can heal. She realizes that she has gotten used to where she now lives, that things in her new land, like the sound of geese, are now �familiar to her�. The narrator of the story says, �..she  realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� almost familiar to her now.� Things in Saeng new home had been strange to her at first, but she had healed and gotten used to them. Saeng has also healed from leaving her original home of Vietnam. She was sad to leave her home, � A work so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.�, but she had healed. Saeng  remembers the flowers that she had known in vietnam as �old friends�, showing that it did not hurt her to remember them. When Saeng heals from failing   her driving test, like she had healed when moving  from Vietnam to the united states, she can re-visit the test, without pain.	3	3		3																					
2470	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows the character, Saeng , was going to adapt to their new home and stay strong. I believe, when Saeng�s mother says, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus,�� I think Saeng�s mother is also sort of thinking about Saeng Its almost as if she�s saying that the move here scarred Saeng but she will be strong and survive the change likes anyone who has failed a test, she will study more and try hander to pass it next time. Saeng  isn�t going to give up and she�ll keep holding on to make it through Saeng knows it�s hard to adjust to changes to life�s but with a little courage and hard work, it will be a breeze. If she believes in herself, she�ll be able to get situated in this new place.	2	3		3																					
2471	4	when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. That is in there for many reasons. One is because when winter comes and brings all the snow it kills her garden. So thats why she wants it to be spring again so she can start growing things agian in her garden. She got to take a test on the things that she is growing to make sure it is @CAPS1 for someone to eat it. Thats why I think the paragraph �when the come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	0	0		0																					
2472	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concluded the story with an interesting paragraph. It was, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again� (@NUM1). This shows that the girl is adapting to her new country and hopes to do better in the spring. The reson the author ended the story with this paragraph is because it shows that the girl has successfully adapted to her new country and is determined to get stronger as time goes. She is saying when the hibiscus returns, she will be ready to take the test again and not fail it.	2	2		2																					
2473	4	The Hibiscus is budding means that the flower was growing. That is a flower with lots of bright colors and nothing else can beat it. The reason another flower can�t beat it is because that flower represents so much thing and it is one of the most natural born flowers around.	1	1		1																					
2474	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that was how he wanted the story to end. He wanted to end the story with her talking to herself.	0	0		0																					
2475	4	"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus�. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says �In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again�. This shows Saeng�s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng�s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."	2	2		2																					
2476	4	Because she was promiseing herself that when spring comes back then she will take the drivers test agin.	1	1		1																					
2477	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show her determination. When she says. ��when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Saeng is explaining how the geese have the determination to fly back and that the hibiscus has the determination to bud again so why shouldn�t she have the determination and confidence to take the test again. Saeng said, �I-I failed the test.� It seems as if failing the driving test made her feel like she was going to fail in the new country. But after she saw the geese�s and hibiscus�s determination through harsh conditions, she was determined to try the test again.	2	2		2																					
2478	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to explain how she already took the test and it is now winter, she will retake the test again when all of the flowers and plants come back to life and start again. Saeng wants to take the test again to show her mother that she can pass it, she bought a plant called. dorl Faeng-noi for nineteen dollars to help her mother not be disapointed. However mother was disapointed that she spent that much money on a plant. 	1	1		1																					
2479	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that when she sees the things from her home and living, it will comfort her in what she does. The author seems like she needs things from her homeland that help her make the best of things and bring back good memories of earlier life. I think that whenever I want to do a good job It helps to think of the good  things that mean alot to me so I will be happy and want to do good. The author is smart to want to see those things for her to retake her test because if she sees her plant doing well and sees the memory of the geese again it will be good luck for her.	2	2		2																					
2480	4	The author chooses to end the story with such a paragraph as this in order to show that Saeng has received a new burst of hope from her memories and the newly familiar things in her new home. The combination of the failed driver�s test and being away from her original home caused Saeng to feel much loss. While Saeng is in the flower shop, �aware of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her. �Through the rest of the story Saeng is shown to still be down, and the reader is left unsure if she will be alright. Then her recovery begins with the presence of familiar things. �The pungent small of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng�s mouth watered,�, �The winter hibiscus� was in the ground now�, and, �overhead a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faints honks clear and � yes � Familiar to Saeng now.� This realization that the geese are familiar to her gives way to new realization and a new wave of hope. She recognizes the fact that she is now coming to be familiar with many of the things about her new hone that she had initially thought to be strange. This is what the final paragraph explains to the reader. It summarizes Saeng�s newfound hope that she will learn to not just live in her new home, but to thrive in it. 	3	3		3																					
2481	4	The auther concludes the story with this statement because it shows that to her the hibiscus symbolizes overcoming obstacles. It symbolizes this because she says�...and the geese return and this is budding, I will take that test again� (Ho @NUM1). This shows that even though she failed it this time when the hibiscus gets bigger she will retake the test, it shows ??? or overcoming obstacles. Also I believe that this symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it �gives her strength from her old country�. This shows that it symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it will help her overcome this test. It will do this by giving her strength or comforting her. From this you can tell that the author ends the story with this statement. ???...	2	2		2																					
2482	4	I believe that the author concludes  the story with this paragraph because it says that Saeng is confident and is willing to go back and take the test. Saeng feels good about her self and wants to do this.	1	1		1																					
2483	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was taking a test. In the story there are some quotes to support my response �I-I failed the test� Saeng said.� This shows that she was taking a test about gardening. Another reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the story was about spring, gardening, and the life of it to them. The paragraph talks about spring, and flowers. The daughter and mother live off of the plants by planting vetagables, and fruits.	0	0		0																					
2484	4	The  last  paragraph of the story.� Winter Hibiscus by Minfong  Ho is important to the story. The last paragraph leaves a definite ending so the  reader  knows  exactly what is going to happen  in the future.  This  paragraph is a very significant ending to the story because it represent s symbols in the story. The author concludes the hibiscus is important to her. Along with the hibiscus it also shows that the  geese  and the melting of the snow represent a fresh  start  and a new  beginning . These symbols  are  important  to her in that they  give  her a chance to start over and she sees that in the  winter  hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2485	4	Saeng was very distrout knowing that she didn�t passed the test the test and to her she felt as though it was a let down or disappointment. This sentence shows the ambition and determination that Saeng has so that she will be able to pass this test.	1	1		1																					
2486	4	The author concludes the story with when they come back ��to show how saeng has changed throughout the plot of the story. In the beginning she refers to her new home as, �walking into another world.� As teenager she had to move from Vietnam where traditions are so much different than in the United States. However, there is one plant that is similar, the winter Hibiscus. The plant connects her previous life and home to the life and home she lives now. It was hard to adapt to the situation of moving, but the plant created familiar scents and the �familiar fragrance �which �filled her lungs .� It was even difficult for saeng to say the words �at home� without bursting into tears. Once the winter Hibiscus was in the ground it changed saeng and she realized that she needed to appreciate what she had. In conclusion, the author ended the story with that paragraph because it showed how much the plant resembled saeng and how her mind set on life was altered.  	3	2		3																					
2487	4	"I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says,�when the snows melt and the geese return� this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, �when this hibiscus is budding,""  and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam.  Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement.   "	3	2		3																					
2488	4	I think that the author is saying  to  day  is that when it is winter the hibiscus is  trying to piece the cold. While must plants just die the hibiscus must face it head on	0	0		0																					
2489	4	I think the author includes this because she doesn�t want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then �I will take the test again.� This quote is saying she @MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you don�t no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng @MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.	2	2		2																					
2490	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� purposely had that last paragraph in there. Honestly the story is better with it too. In the last paragraph when it says �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 @NUM1. When the author write all those things in nature that will happen it symbolized re-birth and a fresh start, a new chance and that is what Saeng needs with her drivers license. The author put powerfully. Put those symbols in there to show hope for the girl to make it through her tough time. Finally, the story has a sense of roundness and end with that last paragraph, the story is complete.	2	1		2																					
2491	4	The reason I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph was because it was a good learning story you can learn something from it .The author did that so you can get a better understanding of the of the story. It said �saeng .teenage  girl, and her family have moved to the united states of Vietnam.� So from reading that it tells me that its telling you what happen right before the story took place. So you can get a better understanding. To me its rapping it all up for you. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2492	4	I believe the author of �winter Hibiscus �ends the story like she did because saeng agrees to take the test again. She wants to take the test when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. In other words when spring has come she will be ready for the test.  Saeng states in the story �it�s the flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, thes winte hibiscus. That�s what matters.� I think saeng is using this as a guiding light since she just moved from Vietnam. She plans to make it and use the plant as a symbol. She will try again for her drivers license at the start of spring.	2	1		2																					
2493	4	"The author used ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because its resembling that her mother is refreshing, waking, and restoring its self. And Saeng said she would retake the driving test when that happens. She was really sad she failed. �I � I failed the test� She seemed to be embarrassed + sad. So that last paragraph does a good job describing what Saeng is going to do. She is going to look on the bright side of things and restore her self to come back and pass the test"	2	2		2																					
2494	4	I the narrator this paragraph in the story because hibiscus is a valueable plant and garden is you own decision if you like to grow things like her mother grow hot pepper. Garden is a way to @CAPS1 different like the different types of foods you can plant and the different plants in the world there eg @CAPS2, lilis, and other other plants like that.	0	0		0																					
2495	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she is trying to overcome an obstacle. Failing the driver�s test was a set back for Saeng so she plans to take it again. She plans to use the hibiscus as motivation, because the winter for the hibiscus is like overcoming an obstacle.	1	1		1																					
2496	4	Why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because I think it�s showing how much it actually means to her and shows that she does actually care And by showing that she care's will take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2497	4	She ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to let everyone know she feels most comfortable in the spring. It also states that she can not wait for the geese and the hibiscus to start budding because it is her favorite time of the year.	1	1		1																					
2498	4	Saeng is not comftorable in her sorryndings, and has not addapted to the changes from where she moved. She finds the hibiscus and choses to go buy it, because it reminds of her home in @LOCATION2. When she brings it home  her mother seems shocked at first by the price saeng had paid, but is then more sympathetic when she realizes she misses @LOCATION2. Sheang says she is going to retake her test in the spring. She is also implying that she is going to change her attitude about living in @LOCATION1.	2	1		2																					
2499	4	I think the author concludes that in the story becaue he is saying when the geese is coming back.	0	0		0																					
2500	4	The author concludes that because she wants to show that Saeng was not giving up. I say this because she moved to, a place where she didn�t like and knew No one. The author is trying to tell us no matter what don�t give up, have faith. At the end Saeng has faith in herself that she can past the test next time. She @MONTH1 have realized that just because your at place you don�t want to, it doesn�t mean you can�t go on.	1	2		2																					
2501	4	The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. That�s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that.	1	1		1																					
2502	4	I think That The author concludes the story with This paragraph to show that she does not want to give up on fighting her homesickness. The first time she bought that plant, it brought back memories of her old home and it showed how much she missed it there. By saying shell do the test again shows that she doesnt want to let ths defeat her in her new home and her new life.	2	1		2																					
2503	4	The author concludes saeng vow in the story to show that saeng can and does have the ability to overcome obstacle. Saeng  feels like she is a failer. Her hibiscus represents courage to overcome her obstacle which is her driving test that she failed. The geese represent survial and to never give up, to keep trying your hardest to success.	2	1		2																					
2504	4	The author concludes the story with this because the girl in the story is almost like the flower itself. Just as the flower will blossom, Saeng will take the test again, both receive a fresh start on things. Finishing the story this way left the reader feeling positive, it was a short ending but one with a lot of meaning. � ...and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the last sentence is almost inspirational and it makes you want to start out fresh as well as Saeng.	1	2		2																					
2505	4	The author ends the story with  �When they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� For many good reasons. Some reasons are, that she will keep moving on and adapting to her new life in Canada. She is going to change her way of life and try to fit in with her new culture. She is also going to have to relive the memory of her grandmother again and wants to handle it better. � A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eye now swept over her.� She wants to be able to handle the loss better. The author wants to emphasize that the story is not yet over.      	2	2		2																					
2506	4	There are many reasons the narrator could have ended with this paragraph. One reason it's the start of the winter so hibiscus won't return until spring. Also, it�s the end of the story so it�s a good way to end it because it�s the ending of the hibiscus and the ending of the story. The last paragraph also kind of summarizes up the story and it�s short and sweet. Which makes it a great ending to the story. It�s not like most endings to a story so it�s unique. Because most stories aren�t about nature. In conclusion, there are many reasons the narrator could have choose to end the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2507	4	"The author concludes the story with his paragraph to show how people can regain their determination. In the beginning of the story, Saeng is disheartened after failing her driving test. When she sees the Hibiscus, she is filled with memories of the past and weeps. Her mother's kindness causes Saeng to draw strength from the flower, which, as her mother says, is ""strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" @CAPS1 that the Hibiscus will bud in the spring, Saeng renews her determination to pass the test. "	2	2		2																					
2508	4	The author ends with this response  because he is trying to say that Saeng will repeat her self but this time more helpful in the garden and her mother.Try harder with her school work and less focusing on gardening.	0	0		0																					
2509	4	Saeng's peRsonality in this stoRy shows deteRmination and confident. I think she feels that she could do moRe experienced things on different plants. I also think this is a peRfect hobby experience foR someone who loves Plants. I feel that Saeng @MONTH1 have accomplished heR goals of planting. I think she @MONTH1 want to puRsue heR career in gaRdenning. When she stated that when the plants come back aRound, she would take the test again. I think she means that, she is willing to exploRe more plants. I think she @MONTH1 have got this experience of planting fRom heR motheR. To me this @MONTH1 have been a family tradition. Saeng will pRobably have kids and teach them about different types of floweRs.	1	1		1																					
2510	4	The author ended the story with the paragraph in order to show that Saeng is looking forward into her life and with a positive outlook. It shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore. The hibiscus is used as a device for this story�s plot. When changes happen with the hibiscus, changes happen in the story. At first, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she plans it, things start to look up. She begins to accept the change when the last paragraph says, �when they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� it shows that Saeng is looking at her future positively, and with this positive change, the hibiscus is now beginning to bloom. The author concludes the story in a symbolic way that helps express the story�s themes.	3	2		3																					
2511	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph �Saeng vowed silently to herself� because she Saeng wants to do in proper time and season. �winter season�, the land or soil was so cold that plants was not able to grow properly. �Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars�, and she Saeng failed the test. �There was frail, wiry beauty to her Saeng mother that touched Saeng deeply�, she Saeng mother is shining when she worked to plants. These all are the description that concludes in the past which want to make correction and shine like her mother and also to pass the test.  	1	1		1																					
2512	4	"At the end of the short start �Winter Hibiscus,� Saeng says �when they comeback, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" When she says this she is refering to her drivers test she says she will take the test again because she is reminded that her family didnt give up they moved to @LOCATION1 for a fresh start �plant she had forgotten drew her back to her childhood world. �She sees these flowers after failing which reminds her that she never given up before. So she wont now other.  "	2	2		2																					
2513	4	The author is trying to convey a sense of hope for Saeng in her new country. After noting that she failed her test, which is probably a citizenship test, the author wants to conclude the story with something that reasures the reader. It is obvious that this test was important because Saeng could not even look her mother in the eye. This was probably why she bought the flower for her mother. The ending reasures the reader so that you don�t wonder how it will workout for Saeng.	1	1		1																					
2514	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because to tell us that she will try and find that flower to bring back memories of her old home. To show us that they will be caming   back again it will survive even though its not from where she wanted it to be from. In the story it says,� I I failed the test,� meaning saeng had bought the hibiscus that wasn it real or what she thought was not what she wanted to be. In the last paragraph she says she will take that test again. Saying she will find winter hibiscus that is how it use to be in the homeland. She�s hoping they survive and hoping she finds a flower like it because in that last paragraph it says ,�saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again,� meaning she hopes and prays she will find one like her old homeland.      	0	0		0																					
2515	4	The Author was trying to end the story quick thats why he ended it with this one.	0	0		0																					
2516	4	When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn�t do good on the test the first time. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he don�t want people to think that she just worries about the plants.	1	1		1																					
2517	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" is about this girl named Saeng and her mother and grandmother. Flowers are beauitful to them they plant them all day. Picking them, @CAPS1 them. �Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye�    "	0	0		0																					
2518	4	The author concludes the story with the saying because it shows that she has confent in her self because she did not pass the test she could take it again and know she can pass the test she was up set about it her mother when she talk to her made her feel good and confent to do or retake the test and know she could pass the test so that why I think the author concludes it with that saying at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2519	4	This paragraph means when winter is over and the geese come back from the south, and she favorite plant comes back that used to be in her old country, she will try what she was trying to do before but this time she has more confidence. This is what I think this means.	1	1		1																					
2520	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sums everything up and solves the conflict of her failing her driver's test. When Saeng said ""� I will take that test again"" it showed that she is determined to pass the tes and will try again. Since the conflict is solved there you pretty much have to introduce a new conflict to keep the story going so the author just ends it. This excerpt from the last paragraph also incorporates Saeng difficultly to that geese because just as geese faces hardships getting her driver lisense. But also like the geese she will go back her face hardships again. "	1	2		2																					
2521	4	In the story � Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the author ends the story in a well mannered carhoined. The author ended with that paragraph to show that Saeng was not going to persuade even though for away from home. She is in a down was spiral at the beginning of the story she had failed a test and the hibiscus test her feeling nostalgic. When she got home her mother greeted her with kinds words kind of acting as an anti-depressent by making her food will not peppers and bitter melons. This kind of made Saeng see the good in life causing her not to give up and be confident that she will pass the test.	3	2		3																					
2522	4	"Well in the story, Saeng  fails her driving test. When she is walking home she sees a familar plant, she then goes to a flourist and finds out the plant is called a hibiscus. She then buys the plant with the little money she has because it reminds her of her homeland and childhood. It also reminds her of her grandmother who she left behind so now she is connected to the plant. Also she sees geese fly over head heading south for the winter, so she says �When they come back,� so she means when the geese fly north for @DATE1. And when �the snow melts"" so when it becomes warmer and starts spring. When �this hibiscus is budding,� so when spring comes and the plant starts to bloom she will �take that test again"" so she says she will take the driving test that she failed when spring comes. She gives herself the winter to practice and get ready for the test . She vows to herself that come spring she will be ready to take the test and this time she will pass."	2	2		2																					
2523	4	She said this too show the determination it takes to make it no matter how many times you fail you need to get back up and try again. She displays her courage in this way also, it takes alot for someone to fail something and to get back up and try again on it. She isnt willing to accept failure, and she's trying to redeem her failure so she says she'll try again. That is why she ended the story that way.	1	1		1																					
2524	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. I think the author did this so that people who read the story will know what she is gonna do next spring and they might make out another storie in so that you will know that she will take the test in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2525	4	In the story winter hibiscus the author concludes the story with that paragraph because when the winter hits and the plant she likes will disappear and the flower gave her good luck so she said �when the snow melt in the spring and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The flower was very important to her. She said, �that rich, sweet scent that was familiar too. She was talking about the flowers smell compares to her grand mothers shell, it was the same.	2	1		2																					
2526	4	The author concludes the story like this because she is going to come back and do the samething next year.	0	0		0																					
2527	4	The author concludes the story with that because she want's to retake the test. Because she wants to pass the test for her mother. So she brought home the flower to apologize to her mother.	1	1		1																					
2528	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because everything in the story will repeat such as the season changes and you will not be able to plant nor grow in the winter. For example she talked about how the plants are nothing like her home, but she has to adapt to the fact she�s not home, & adjust to her environment. I say this because if she doesnt she will just be an unhappen person worrying about where she came from.	1	1		1																					
2529	4	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.	2	2		2																					
2530	4	when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself In the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibicus budding then I will take that test again	1	1		1																					
2531	4	In �@CAPS1 Hibiscus� by @PERSON1, the author choose the last paragraph because it matched the tone, the hope and the representation of the essay. The tone of the story is more of a depress ful mood because she failed the drivers test so she is very upset. He memories of her old country start to get to her when she sees the winter hibiscus. �And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� She misses Vietnam very much and seeing this plant in this store gives her like flash backs. The winter starts to give her the feels all hope is lost. �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� To her the strange things are starting to feel the same year by year no new hope, no new anything just the same old thing day by day. This plant really starts to tear her apart just purly from the representation. �She found that she was still to shakey to say the word at home, lest she burst into tews again.� She can�t say home because home isn�t hers in the United States but in Vietnam. This winter hibiscus gives Saeng an explosion of emence emotion�s all having to deal with her past sr the last paragraph is more giving to how when her hope returns in spring she will just try again. Tone, hope, and representation all support the last paragraph so thats why it fits when it does	3	3		3																					
2532	4	This was a very interesting story and it snowed all the hardships this young girl has gone through, the author ended it in a very interesting way. When they ended the story I thought to myself how nice it ended. If think the author did a very nice job. She made it so that she snowed all the hard ships that Saeng had gone through, as if they were the harsh winter. Then as the author said, �as the snow melts away;��,I think this shows how even though Saeng  problems seem never ending and harsh, that one day they will be gone and things will become beautiful again, like the flower budding. In the spring time. Also she did a nice job because throughout the story I could feel her pain. I felt as if I was there with her because of her use of descriptive  words like, �exploding, shock ,intense� and others to describe how much of a sudden was everything was. Then when she ended it, it was like she was showing us Saeng�s hope for a better future, even though things aren�t the way they were back home!	2	3		3																					
2533	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph -� when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� (@NUM1) because she feels that when the hibiscus blooms she can too bloom by passing the test. Also Saeng is relating herself to the hibiscus. �Its� flower arn�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it throu in here, this winter hibiscus.� (@NUM1) Her mother is trying to tell her she can be strong also. She too can make it through the cold months. �like the geese she lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etered against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.� (@NUM1) Just like the geese Saeng is realizing to be proud of herself and there will be other chances. Don�t always doubt yourself becase they will be other chances. Don�t be afraid to try again.	2	2		2																					
2534	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she means she will go back after winter to take care of it. The author puts this at the ending paragraph because he is telling how much she cares about this plant cause she takes care of it because it reminds her of her hometown. So that is the reason she takes such good care of it so she will have something with her to remind her of her home.	1	1		1																					
2535	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph about the geese because it shows how Saeng, like the geese, will adopt to her new environment. It shows that she will do what needs to be done in order to survive just like the geese have to do. She will take the test again and will not give up. The paragraph shows how she wants to adapt to the new country. For example, the narration states, �� she noticed the tearstains on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes�[No]. This example shows how Saeng is not used to being in the new country and that she does not like it. However, she will get used to it and do her best to do so, as shown in the closing paragraph. Also, the narration states, ��she admitted to herself, she much preferred it to a Big Mac�[Ho]. This proves how even though she @MONTH1 not like things at times, Saeng is willing to try them to get used to the new country. The narration states, ��she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become familiar to her now �[@NUM1].Saeng is getting more and more used to her surrounding and is adopting to them, just like the geese adapt, which is the reason the author ended the story with the paragraph about geese.	3	3		3																					
2536	4	The reason why the author wrote the conclusion paragraph was to show that Saeng is looking forward to a brighter future. Saeng is hoping to see the geese once more that remind her of her homeland and that see wants to pass the driving. In this story I feel as though Saeng is a very sentimental person and so that is why I think that is reason the author wrote the conclusion paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2537	4	He author concludes this paragraph in this story because It sounds good and to show the people he is writing it to that no matter what happend s to you in life you should Just keep on doing what you think is best for you. Just like the flower she keeps coming back for more after going through all that�s tuff. 	1	1		1																					
2538	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for a reason. The hibiscus reminds her of Vietnam. The geese remind her of her home now. These two things make her strong. Therefore, she will take the test when they return. She thinks she can pass the test when the flower and the geese are in her life.	1	1		1																					
2539	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to take responsibility for her school work now. For example in the story she made it obvious she cared more about the garden then school.	0	0		0																					
2540	4	Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said �yes| when she planted the hibiscus.	0	0		0																					
2541	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the story was mostly talking about the hibiscus. Saeng was saying that when it�s spring and this hibiscus is budding then she will take the test again. The hibiscus reminded her of her homeland in the past.	1	1		1																					
2542	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because at the end is talking of a new begining. Also what it�s going to be at the new begining she says that she is going to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2543	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she has a better state of mind because she found  a  flower that reminds her of homeland. She is afraid that her parents  are going to be mad at for not passing the test, therefore she  buys  a  flower  that she sees for it remind. When she gets home and telling her mom how much she paid for the flower  and  how  she  didn�t  pass, mother is upset for only a second, then she is understanding of what her  daughter is going throgh. By the end  of the story she has  more confidence  that  she  will succeed next time.	2	2		2																					
2544	4	"Minfong tto ended the story with aphrase dialogue because it was about the main topic of the story. Saeng was to buy a plant and bring it home, but when she did so, her mother did not approve. The narrative states ""You what?"" Her mother stared at her incredulously""(Ho ). When her mothesaid this, it showed that she was displeased. The narrative states, ""I-I failed the test""(Ho). Saeng was not proud to displease her parents in any way. By saying, ""When hey come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return  and this hibiscus is budding, then i will take that test again""(Ho), the author is just showing Saeng's love and want to grow foe her parents; it shows maturity. "	2	2		2																					
2545	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to tell the reader that Saeng is going to take the test again. The author wants to tell the reader because she fail the test she know what she did wrong and shes going to correct. For example when Saeng said, �then I will take that test again.� Saeng feel sorry she fail a simple test so she wants to retake the test when the snow melts.	1	1		1																					
2546	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant wasent budding and the geese are going away and then see failed the test because all that made her sad. But when the snow melts, the geese return and the plant starts budding she will be happy again and she will take the test agian and she will pass because she is happy.	1	1		1																					
2547	4	The author concludes the story this way for many reasons. One reason is to show Saeng is not going to give up and keep trying to pass her test. Another way is to show that even though your life has changed that don�t mean that you have to give up. These are some of the way that the author concludes the story like he does.	1	1		1																					
2548	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because they wanted to show that she is comited to her nature especially to The hibiscus. She thought that the hibiscus was special because of what she did with it. Like when they said �she reached out and touched petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velet toward the centre�. And that�s why I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph.  	1	1		1																					
2549	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng feels like that will be the right time to take over her driving test over and when the hibiscus is budding. And another reason would be because the authors wants to show her determination,	1	1		1																					
2550	4	She vowed this paragraph because she wanted to make her mother proud by passing the test after she had failed it, but she waits for the plant to go through and start budding. The hibiscus buddy is like a new start so it makes it through winter and it will pass the test and then Saeng will be able to pass as well because she knows a tropick plant was able to survive a harsh winter then she can survive / pass the test the next spring.	1	2		2																					
2551	4	Why I think the auther concludes the last paragraph in the story because it's kind of like a moral to the story. Shes trying to say that when the time is right she will try it again untill she gets it right. Without this last paragraph you wouldn't be able to understand the message of the story.	0	0		0																					
2552	4	Saeng is a very helpful young lady to her mom she makes things the author made that the ending sentence to make the story more intresting for the read ond to keep thom heoked to the end	0	0		0																					
2553	4	The authoR concludes the stoRy with that sentence b/c she wanted to explain to you that she will do this again when the hibiscus is back in season.	1	1		1																					
2554	4	I guess she says this because she only wants to take the test when she is confetebel around the flowers, plants, and greens	1	1		1																					
2555	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means that when she gets older and gets more confidence then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready just like the hibiscus will be ready to start to budding again.	1	1		1																					
2556	4	The Author ends the story off with that paragraph because when dealing with flowers and nature. Then are seasons  when the flowers don�t  come up like winter for example. The paragraph is saying in the spring when the winter is over she tells her self that she will look forward to seeing all the plant that nature has to give.	0	0		0																					
2557	4	I believe he used this as the ending to ensure that she was strong and she would do whatever it took to perservere.	0	0		0																					
2558	4	The author includes  this sentence in  the paragraph  because  it�s  the  start  of  a  new  beginning.	1	1		1																					
2559	4	In the story the author concludes with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think she did that to say that you shouldn�t give up. In the story Saeng goes to the store and �touched a petal.� She buys the plant in an attempt to get a reminder of her old home. In this way it seems Saeng is willing to give up her memories of her past. When she brings home the plant and her mom and her plant it in the garden. I think Saeng is trying to make her new home like her old.	2	2		2																					
2560	4	The author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with Saeng vowing to take the test in the spring when the geese return, the snow melts, and the hibiscus is budding. This is done to symbolize the many things that Saeng learnt. For example, she learnt she has to adjust to changes in her life and becoming familiar to the new things. The geese and snow she admits are the things that were �strange before [and] had become familiar to her now�. The hibiscus also represents something and has a reason for being included in the last paragraph. It represents the ability to overcome obstacles, connection to the past, and comfort when needed. The last paragraph symbolizes many things, and if you look into it deeply, you will learn what Saeng learnt.	2	2		2																					
2561	4	The author ends the story with Saeng vowing to herself the relationship between passing and driving test and the significance of the hibiscus flower. The flower is linked to the way things used to be for her in Vietnam. For example, hibiscus in @LOCATION3 was �Madagascar periwinkle� in Vietnam. It also symbolizes how the flower adapts to its surrounding when taken from a different country in accordance to Saeng adjusting to life in @LOCATION3. The reason she said when spring comes she will take the test again symbolizes that connection of the flower to the way she lives now. For instance, her ability and determination that when that flower buds she will overcome obsticles. Another is a connection of her past experiences. And it was a sense of comforting to her after she failed her driving test. The author linked the flower�s significance to the ending of the story showing the hope and dedication to Saeng and the obstacles she passes to get where she is today.	2	2		2																					
2562	4	The reason why I belive the author concluded the story like that, is because, she is going going to aways start over. For instants in the story she said I�I failed the test. From that known she throught she was going to give up. So that is why I belive he ended the story with that line	1	1		1																					
2563	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because the author is trying to say that Saeng is going to start all over again just like the hibiscus would. Even though you go through bad times in your life just step and do it over again until it becomes better. The author also concluded the story with that paragraph because the paragraph pretty much starts the story all over again that like Saeng was going do.  	2	2		2																					
2564	4	She means that when she return she is going to do the same thing again and see if she will do better or not.	0	0		0																					
2565	4	"Saeng vowed siletly to herself ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because her mind went of the track from think about a flower. She says "" One of the blossoms had fallen off"" then carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. it happ distracted her mind. Her promisreaction from tailing was silentess for a long moment and didn't say nothing. Her never got mad. All she did was brushing the fragments of green off Saeng's hands. Her mother was mainly thinking about the plants as the day went, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the 'winter hibiscus"" into it. Seeing her mother caused a reaction of ideas, so trying to etch a image of geese. She sent a goat to retake the driving test again as she was getting use to her new. The intro says ""Saeng, a teenage girl and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. it never mentioned about her family"""	1	1		1																					
2566	4	The author included this paragraph to show how much the girl missed Vietnam. When the girl saw the hibiscus it brought back memories of Vietnam. Seeing the hibiscus allows her to find comfort. So the paragraph is there to show how the United States is different from Vietnam. Since the United States has changing seasons it allows the girl to get use to the United States. The plant will always be there, but she has to look for the good that United States provides. The author states, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This quote shows how the girl was getting use to the United States. How she will always remember Vietnam, and finds things in the United States that remind her of Vietnam. In conclusion, the paragraph is used to show how much the girl missed Vietnam, but how she finds comfort within the United States.	1	2		2																					
2567	4	Thes basically say that he will be around again just like the geese always come back.	0	0		0																					
2568	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. One being that she is still uncomfor table about talking about her old home ��She was still to make to say the words at home�� [HO] so the snow melting the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding. Second remind her of her home. We know this because Saeng   says �� Just as she known it would feel� �� Back home it Just grow wild just at from the cracks in the brick walls or between tiled roofs�� [HO].So with reminder of her home she is give both comfort and confidence. The author therefore concluded with this paragraph because since the geese, hibiscus, and the snow melting remind her of her home, that is when she will take the test again, w hen she is confident and strong.   	2	1		2																					
2569	4	By adding this paragraph to the end of the story, it show that a resolution was made and that the theme of overcoming obstacles is present in the story. When Saeng failed the test, she was miserable and heartbroken however, after buying the hibiscus, she had found hope and motivation and decides, in the end, that she will take the test again, �in the spring, when the snow melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. This hope at the end of the story helps put the reader at ease when they wonder what might happen next. Its to help move the story to a conclusion. This is why most endings are meaningful like this. Readers are able to abtein the message as the story from paragraphs like this. In this case, the author�s message was to never give up and that people find motivation in simple things. It is important to know what a author is trying to tell the reader through paragraphs as not only a reader trying to understand the purpose of a story, but also as a writer trying to express their ideas clearly to an audience.	2	2		2																					
2570	4	I think that the author uses this quote, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.� @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. �But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?� �BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.� @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable. 	3	3		3																					
2571	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that the hibiscus is a symbol for Saeng. In the sping time the hibiscus grows just like Saeng. When Saeng got to the new place she was small and peuney just like the plant. �Its leaves quavering in the wind"" (@NUM1). This quote tells us the the plant was weak a peuney. If the plant was strong it would not be quivering. The fact that Saeng brokedown and bought the plant tells us she was not strong. And at the end the author uses that paragraph to tell the reader that the hibiscus is strong and so is Saeng and the can over come anything."	2	2		2																					
2572	4	The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says �Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, �� and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. 	2	2		2																					
2573	4	In this story the reason that the author concludes things this way is to pick a tone that feel comfortable to test again. The person who will take the test again my have picked the tone with relation to her past which she takes the time to prepare herself and maybe that is something her parents or grandparents taught her.	1	1		1																					
2574	4	"The author concluded this because she thinks this is the right time to re take the test. She adds this because the snow is melted, the hibiscus is budding, and the geese return is a perfect time because everything is back and warm. She says ""when they come back...then I will take the test again.� means she will have all confidence to take the test. Saeng voweds to take it again and she will and she thinks this time she will pass. That's what theauthor concludes this to the story."	1	1		1																					
2575	4	"The Author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope and the meaning of the hibiscus to Saeng. The author also ends the story like that because spring is a time for new beginings and where everything comes back to life and starts to regrow so to say that when the snow melts and geese return. ""Its. saying its the right time for a secnd chance. I.t failed the test Saeng said.....She tore off a leaf shruddy it to pests�. that shows the dying of the hope she had or the hybisus symbolized it. So that�s why the author ended it like that b/c it shows new heqionqrys."	2	1		2																					
2576	4	The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, with the strong paragraph of one sentence starting that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This sentence leaves the reader in suspense while incorporating the main point of the story and combining them to express an idea about what might happen in a continuation on the future of @CAPS1 and this story. After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort her mother and her-self. While she stood watching the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng�s feelings to stay determined and take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a string sentence which not only summerized the story, but left a cliff hangs.	3	2		3																					
2577	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself ,in the spring ,when snows melt and geese return and  this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again� . The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this makes you think about the story after your done reading it.	0	0		0																					
2578	4	In many stories the narrator uses a dramatic yet conclusive statement to end the story. An example of one such occurrence is in the short story �Winter Hibiscus�. In the story the young girl finishes of by telling us when she will be taking her test again, although not directly to us as it says �Saeng vowed silently to herself� but it still informs the reader. The reason the author includes this last �vowe� is to inform not only the reader of the future but to show the girls determination and spiritual connection with the plant. For example, when it says �and this hibiscus is budding� its showing the girls connection with the plant because of the comfort and canfidence it given her, ecpecially since she needs to take the test. In conclusion the narrator concluded the story with the paragraph to show future events and to illustrate the spiritual connection the girl was with her the flower and the homeland.	2	2		2																					
2579	4	In the story, at the end of the last paragraph the author wrote that �why they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� (last paragraph). The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to mention that Saeng is a student and she had failed a test. Even though Saeng is so interest in flowers she also cares about her school too. When the snows melt Saeng will take the test just like the hibiscus is budding and starting to blossome.	1	1		1																					
2580	4	After they come Saeng  was  silently  to herself , In the spring , when the snows melt  and  the geese return and  the hibiscus  is Saeng  then  I am  take that test again.  She  say this sentence she is herself back to home .She  thinks  it familiar to Saeng  was. She  is herself  how  quiet it vowed  to  so  every season . Her live is very quiet and leavy . She feels  as  of place .  Due to failing her driving test things herself  was thing for her to united state was so different from vietnam and she expresses  her  feelings  will she talk a about this something flower.   	1	1		1																					
2581	4	The author conclude the story with this paragraph because the author wants to remind the reader and summarize the story. The way she wants to summarize is how the story started with Saeng failing the test to how the story endend with saeng planting the hibiscus in the winter. The author wants to remind the reader about the whole story.	1	1		1																					
2582	4	He concludes this story like that so you dont feel as if she was defeated. She is now more aware or believes she can complete the task. Also she has more selfconcious in herself because of the flower and now it reminds her of her home.	1	1		1																					
2583	4	The auther concluded the story with this because just like the flower it will come back a new, and so will she. The flower represents determination, using the flower to show her own determination. Even though she failed her drivers test she still has determination to take it, and try to pass again. Even with failur she is determained to get over it. Just like the flower losing its buds in the winter and growing them back. Saeng is frogeting her failure and coming back a new.	2	2		2																					
2584	4	"The author uses this paragraph as a symbol of realization, and new beginnig for Saeng. She spent so much time missing the past, that she didn�t know how to enjoy the present, which theme-wise the author is saying �live in the moment�. The hibiscus represents strength, as her mother said,""It's strong enough to make it through the winter months,... that�s what matters. the author is say ultimately that tough times are irevitable, so hold on to the moments that make you smile, for they will help you perservere through the times that are tough."	3	2		3																					
2585	4	In the story �winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the character Saeng had many obstacles to overcome. In the end of the story Saeng vows to herself when winter is over she will take the test again. I think that the author ends the story like that to foreshadow the future for Saeng It seems like the author is trying to say Saeng will be taking time to adjust to her new lifestyle and focus on other things before she takes the test again. It also shows that Saeng has a lot of courage to complete what she has once failed. The perserverance in Saeng shows and will help her overcome many things in her new country. In the text when Saeng's mother starts to dig a hole she says �let me help mother.� This shows her love towards her mother and her care for the plant that represents her pastime. So in the end of the story adding the vow was a good way to show Saeng�s commitment.	2	3		3																					
2586	4	The author puts that excerpt into the text to show the reader that she had made a mistake an will fix it in the future. I believe the other put it in  for that reason because in the text Saeng began to cry when she admitted to her mother that she failed the test. This shows that she was really upset by the fact she failed an hopes to improve in the near future. Another reason why I believe �the author concludes the story like this is to lead the reader on to believe Saeng is going to get over beign home sick.	1	1		1																					
2587	4	The author ends the story �Winter Hibiscus� with the passage �When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is saying how she is going to try to take the test again because of the fact that she failed the first time. I think the hibiscus she bought comforted her and made her think of her home land so she thought when the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. The plant made her think positivly. And insted of thinking she will fail she is thinking she will pass the next time. I also think Saeng felt comforting her when she was upset and I think that helped her feel alot better.	2	2		2																					
2588	4	The author concludes this story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver�s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, �That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?� Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,��in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   	3	3		3																					
2589	4	There is why the author ended the story with this paragraph. It mean that when she comes back after winter she will repeat her tasks all over. For example she will dig, sen flowers, their customers. Then when winter comes again she will do it all over. So has steally the other is using different words to say when winter ends she will repeat her actions. That is why the author ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2590	4	"The author brought out the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", to portray the theme of the story. Saeng used the hibiscus for hope in her life. The author also uses the choice of words or diction to explain the way Saeng lived her life depending on a flower. The paragraph also explains the way her culture is depending on the theme of the story."	1	1		1																					
2591	4	The author conconcludes the story with this paragraph because, the plant brings back memories to Saeng and she is sort of like the plant. Saeng can be compared to the plant by, she is starting out in a new area that she is unfamiliar with, as well as the plant. The plant is now being planted in the soil outside of her house and has to grow. Saeng has to learn to grow aswell and get better and prepare to take the test again. So when the plant is grown and adapted Saeng believes she will be grown and adapted too. In conclusion, this paragraph is a perfect ending for the story �Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho.	2	2		2																					
2592	4	I think that the author ends this story with that paragraph to some up what the story was all about and to also say that Saeng would try the test again. In the story it says �she realised that many of the thing that she had thought of as strange before had become, though the quiet repetition of season opon reason, almost familiar to her now and this last paragraph help bring all this together.	1	2		2																					
2593	4	A vow is a good ending, she vowed to take the test again because she failed it. It expresses how she feels and she made a commitment to pass. The author wanted to show a lot of feeling and how desprite she was. So she saw tons of beauty to keep her going.	1	1		1																					
2594	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph, ""When they come back,"" Saeng vowed silently to herself,� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She buys the flower because she failed the drivers test. She has seen the familiar plant on her way home as she went to a florist shop to try to buy one. The flower makes her happy and reminds her of home. The author ends the story the way he does because it leaves hope, so that the story doesn't end sad. She still has hope of passing the drivers test."	1	2		2																					
2595	4	She failed the test at the same day that she got the plant and saw the geese fly over. The plant and the geese represent symbols to her. The plant represents her home, where she used to live and the geese could represent how they are moving on in life, over coming the obstacles of cold weather, and snow to move on to something better most likely a warmer climate. All of this is a symbol of a new beginning for her. So she wanted to take it again, around the time of a new beginning; when the geese fly over again and the plant grows. She feels thot since she failed, she should start over.	2	2		2																					
2596	4	The author added the story in with this paragraph for a lot reasons and to make the story longer, and two to show that even if you screw up the first time you can still try again.	1	1		1																					
2597	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author includes this paragraph, when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again, to emphasize that Saeng is willing try plant again in spring. Saeng wants to try planting again in the spring time to prove that she is trying to adapt to the new settings and to prove that she cares about the planting.	0	0		0																					
2598	4	Saeng  ment  that she will take that test  next  spring and pass it with the hope of her winter flower  and  the  sight of her flock of geese  she  has high hopes that she will pass her test . when  she sees buds  on her hibiscus then she will take the test again. Saeng was very upset when she failed it the @CAPS1 time and she was hoping  she  passed  next  spring.	1	1		1																					
2599	4	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the author concludes with a paragraph explaining when the character, Saeng will take her driving test again. She says she will ""when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding."" I think the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows that saeng has new. found hope. For example, since she has moved from Vietnam, she has been very homesick. ""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words 'at home,' lest she burst into tears again."" But when she finds a hibiscus plant, it reminds her of her homeland. ""Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs."" Saeng even buys the hibiscus to plant in her garden in her new home. By having the hibiscus plant with her, it gave her memories of her old life and strength to continue with her new one. The plant gives her strength to try for her driving test again. By concluding with that paragraph, it shows Saeng's change in emotions from depressed to hopeful and it also shows the strength that the hibiscus plant gives her."	2	2		2																					
2600	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, �It�s flowers aren�t pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months ???, this winter hibiscus. �It shows that the mother wants saeng to learn that saeng should be strong even I times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, throught the quiet repition of season upon season�� It shows that saeng realized that the new place that she�s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home � In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be  strong and follow the flow of life.	1	2		2																					
2601	4	�In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibisus is budding, then I will take that test again� Saeng thinks to herself. Saeng finds herself in a new place were she has no friends. She finds comfort in a plant shop one day when she comes apon a Hibiscus flower. The flower calms her spierit and helps her beguin to adjust to the changes in her life at this time.	2	1		2																					
2602	4	The author concluded with the paragraph about when winter turns to spring, she will take her driving test again for one main reason. The girl says this because just like the plant coming back to life and starting over, she will start over too. In the essay Saeng, the young girl says, �When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� @CAPS1 Saeng failed the test the first time, She is going to wait until spring so that she can have a fresh start. In the essay, the �winter hibiscus� reminds Saeng of her grandmother and her home in @LOCATION1. This at first makes her sad but then realizes how wonderful her memories are and helps her to get through this tough time. Her memories are going to give her strength to carry on with her life and try her driver�s test again in the spring. 	2	3		3																					
2603	4	The author ends it with that paragraph because the girl is talking about when the @DATE1 or spring comes again she will try again. The author ends it with that because it explains how the girl feels about spring and the animals. The girl says allot about the geese in the story, so we know from that she likes animals.	1	1		1																					
2604	4	Then author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sums up how the memories and the plant effects her. Just like the plant Saeng grows better in her own country and likes it better there but she can still survive in a new place if it is taken care of and fights to stay beautiful. The ending shows that Saeng realizes that if she trys harder she can survive like the plant, so she is going to take the test agian. Her mother say, �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here.� Her mother is trying to tell the daughter its ok and she get through the hard times. In the end Saeng knows she can.	2	3		3																					
2605	4	In the winter Hibiscus, the author chose the to end the story with a hopeful paragraph which stated, �when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason for the decision to end on an optimistic note are as follows. For example, the Hibiscus represents. The ideas of resilience when faced with challenge , and the determination To adapt and succeed. Saeng�s situation is similar to the flower�s, which has been uprooted from its original spot, replanted, and forced to try and survive the Winter. Saeng has moved from her beloved homeland, she must begin life anew in another country, and has been faied with the obstacle of failure in reyards to an unnamed test. In the final paragraph, she finds that like the cherished hibiscus flower, she must be resilient and determined to succeed in her new home   	3	3		3																					
2606	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph (when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again) because it explains what she is going to do when winter is over. Also to keep the readers guessing on what�s going to happen, to Saeng and her mother. Another reason is to have a new story when winter is over.	1	1		1																					
2607	4	I know the reason why the author concludes the story the way he dose and  it is a good reason . It says that since she failed this year next year when it is time to ready up the garden she will tell again . That is a good moral because you have to keep trying and trying to succeed   because even if you fail you are not losing any  progress. It is like what @PERSON1 had happen to him even though it took him @DATE1 tries to successfully  make the light bulb he simply said � I just found out @NUM1 ways not to make a light bulb . So I do agree with this author and how he ended the story.  	1	1		1																					
2608	4	She does this to show her strugle with her gardeding struggle. It is like this because ech year she has to work on her garden because the winter blowes it away meaning it kills it.	0	0		0																					
2609	4	The author ending the story with that paragraph because it shows how Saeng wont give up. Saeng wants to make her mother proud so she is gonna try to do whatever it takes. All Saeng trys to do is make her mother happy. When she failed her mother was disappointed. Then suprisingly understanding. When Saeng told her mother she failed Saeng started to cry, but then her mother wiped the tears away.	1	2		2																					
2610	4	ThE author concludEs the story with this paragraph bEcausE mEans that whEn thE shovEl grow again in the spring, whEn thE snow mElts and the gEEsE rEturn and this hibiscus is budding shE will takE thE tEst again. So shE will wait until thE nExt spring to takE thE tEst..	1	1		1																					
2611	4	In the story the test was if she could overcome her homesickness. When she want to the greenhouse all of the. plants and flower brought back memories of her homeland. When she saw the flower it reminded her of the times life she would get water from the well and and a flower was floating in it. So after the winter she would go back to the place and see if she was still homesick. I feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again  	3	3		3																					
2612	4	I think the author adds the last paragraph because the story could use a little part about Saeng. And what she is planning to do next. Also the author @MONTH1 have added that paragraph because she was maybe thinking about writing a second story of winter Hibiscus, and they wanted to write a part that could be about in the next story. It would make you wonder that if she does take the test again would she pass it this time after the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. I think this @MONTH1 be why the author added this paragraph in the story.	1	1		1																					
2613	4	I think the author concluded the Story with these lines because Saeng feels more confident. First, when saeng first saw the hibiscus, she was sad, but after seeing the flower, she got happy. Next, her mother helps her plant it and saeng is sure it'll be there in spring. Finally, Saeng feels better since she has reflected on her past	1	1		1																					
2614	4	I think Minfong Ho concluded her story �Winter Hibiscus� the way she did to show the avid determination of Saeng, the main character. She failed the test but she got the hibiscus and it helped her to restore her resolve to pass the test. Now that she had a moments of her homeland and her family there she was most likely reminded that they would�ve wanted her to succeed, and so she promises herself that she will take that test again when the hibiscus plant starts budding. This is why I feel that �Winter Hibiscus� was concluded in this way.	2	2		2																					
2615	4	At the end of the essay �Winter Hibiscus� by @CAPS1 Ho, it ends in a positive manner. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason why I think that the author decided to put that there, was to show how Saeng felt about her country. So when the country that she is has spring again, she will take that test because that country reminds her of her original country in the spring. Which makes her feel like she is at home and she can at least take the test. Thats why the author put that sentence at the end of the essay.	2	1		2																					
2616	4	Saeng promises herself that  �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test agan.� The hibiscus is meta phorica to Saeng for her childhood. Evidently she grew up in Vietnam and moved to the @LOCATION2. She misses her homeland, and all the flowers remind her of her homeland. She is overwhelmed by all the memories that she breaks down and cries. Change is a difficult thing to overcome or adjust to, especially moving to a foreign country. She has to cope with it though, and by planting the winter hibiscus is a way of coping. She knows that she will eventually adjust to the major change for she realized, �that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become� almost familiar to her now.� She promises herself that she will retake the drivers test when the hibiscus blossoms because like Saeng a flower changes also. When the hibiscus  finally overcome the cold , dreary winter months and blooms, Saeng will know she is ready to take the test again for that flower can also symbolize her going through changes. The geese in the story also symbolize changes, they have to migrate south in the winter to avoid the cold but return home when its warm enough. Like Saeng, she will avoid the test in the winter but in the spring when she feels comfortable.	1	1		1																					
2617	4	So she saying she will take the test next year.	1	1		1																					
2618	4	The author concludes the story of the end because I think the author concludes the end of the story because he wants to kind of say I will be ready next year to sprout again he will be ready to test him to not cry and break down when he sees the plant to think of childhood memories he will be ready o	1	1		1																					
2619	4	"Saeng buys a winter hibiscus to plant in the garden and to remind her of her homeland. She has failed some sort of test and is upset over it. Her mother feels bad for her so she doesn�t get upset that the hibiscus cost @MONEY1. After planting the hibiscus Saeng says to herself, �.In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. The author uses this paragraph to make you think about whether or not Saeng will fail or pass the test again. It also makes you wonder about what kind of test since the author says �hibiscus is budding�, and �the geese return�, It must be a test that you can only take once a year. because she says that �In the spring"" she will take the test again."	1	1		1																					
2620	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver�s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. 	2	2		2																					
2621	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author ends with this promise or commitment because it shows hope and determination. Saeng vowing to herself �I will take that test again,� shows her determination and unwillingness to fail. That is enough to bring hope to someone who has failed and wants another chance. This paragraph also sums up and displays Saeng�s good character. It shows Saeng�s strength because even though she failed the first time she was going to put herself through the pain of trying again to succeed. To fail and try again shows great inner strength. The author also ends with this paragraph because �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� brings everything back full circle. It holds the promise of Spring and better things to come with it. There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	1	2		2																					
2622	4	"The author added it in at the end not only to make the story have a happy, hopeful ending, but to show the reader that Saeng slowly adjusted to the changes in life. The paragraph above explains that Saeng realized that ""the many things that seemed strange before had become,... almost farmiliar to her now."" So the author lastly concludes that eventhough she failed the test this time, just as the geese will return in the spring, then she can take the test again. She just the point of the story across and its a ""cheerful"" way to end it."	2	2		2																					
2623	4	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agian."", to show that the hibiscus plant has given Saeng hope. It has helped he get threw some rough and difficult times. In the story Saeng has just failed her @CAPS1 test and had to walk home. She was very upset. On her way home Saeng saw a familiar flower. She had walked into a flower store to see if they sold the hibiscus that she had seen. The employee pointed her towards the flower. The hibiscus brought back many memories at her hometown in vietnam. Saeng planted her flowers in the vegtable garden. That flower had given her hope. She is ready to try the @CAPS1 test again."	2	2		2																					
2624	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter the hibiscuses are dying. Also she is leaving and wont come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, and she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2625	4	The reason the author of �Winter hibiscus� ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end  of a moderatly depressing story. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving foreward.  And that the end of your world comes when you make it so. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end.	2	1		2																					
2626	4	The character has what seems to be a new found confidence and a new joy of the plant that reminds her of her home land comforting her and motovating her. She says when those things come back she will try hard to complete the test. She is setting a time to push herself.  As most people try to do	1	1		1																					
2627	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows how sometimes you have to wait till the time right for you to try again... For example, In the book it says �Madagascar periwinkle, its tag announced, �How strang to see it in apat,� Back home it just grew wild jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between roofs.� This shows that anything can be done when the time is right.	1	2		2																					
2628	4	Emotions,symbolizim, to it realized � all are reasons the author concluded the story that way. a reason the author ended the story that way is to leave you, with mixed emotions. Emotions like sadness, hope, and wounder. The author makes the reader feel sad with the girl failing her test and missing home. The author also gives the feeling of hope that they one day will return home. and wandering because the conclusion leaves a lot to be answered. the author uses symbolizes in the concluding, sentances by giving the plant and the geese a sense of impotance in the story and the plant has to do with the home that she really misses. In the final story the author leaves a lot of peceptions on several. Like the importance of the plant and why did they move from a place that they lavd so much. That is why I think the author ended the story that way.	2	1		2																					
2629	4	In the story winter Hibiscus Saeng is fond of Beautiful flowers that once grew in her home land. Her favirte flower was the winter Hibiscus that had beautiful red pedals on it as of velvet. She also failed a test that she had taken so what the story is trying to say is that nothing can be as good as whats at home but sometimes you just need another chance at something.	1	1		1																					
2630	4	I think he did because he wanted to show how he loved everything in life.	0	0		0																					
2631	4	The reason why the author of the story ended the story like that is because after all the hard time that plant went through, it will still bad at the end of the winter. The author said that the plant will take that test again that test is surviving through the could winter and blunming at the end of the winter	1	1		1																					
2632	4	The author concludes  the story  with  that paragraph  for many reasons. One reason is that the author is trying to say that she is going to overcome  the obstacle  (the test)  no matter what. In the text is say �it can make through  the  cold months. � @CAPS1 consumer her which supports the last paragraph also, she is in a new country and is starting a new beginning. In the text it says �Not like the same kind we had before.�This implies that it different in this country and she will soon adjust. Finally it says, �this hibiscus is budding� which means she will bloom.	2	2		2																					
2633	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is by herself, and letting herself know that she is going to try the test she failed again because she is starting to get used to her new home now that shes found something that reminds her of her life before she left.	1	1		1																					
2634	4	The author ends the story likes this so readers can understant the theme. Which is, you can always start over, after a mistake is made. For example saeng failed herb driving test and then it took a toll on her she will try again in the spring. I guess she figures that once she once she has renewed  herself she'll do better.	1	1		1																					
2635	4	Explains why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Cause it all make a little cent to concludes the story with this. Here why I think it does. The paragraph in the one of the main pieces to to the story. �In the spring, when the snows melt and after return,� all she say is is when the snow is gone and the grass come back, I will start planting again and she would be happy with it, �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again,� she went to put her plants up again and tests them to see how them over so she can do them even again. Saeng loved this plant so much that she can�t wait. But when it does she is going to plant a lot. That what the paragraph is saying Saeng is going to wait so he can plant a hibiscus. However, since she came to United States she loved the flower that very much.	0	0		0																					
2636	4	Because to her it is the best time to do things cause all the happy memories return along with the geese and hibiscus.	1	1		1																					
2637	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus is motivating her to test for her drivers test. In the spring, when the snows melt, the geese return, and the hibiscus is budding, then she will take that test again. 	1	1		1																					
2638	4	Several reasons, first, in spring she will have had more time to adjust to her new life. Also when the hibiscus starts budding she will feel conforted, as though it auomaticaly brings back her childhood memories. It also is a link to her past home in Vietnam. When the hibiscus adjusts to its new life in ground soil, she will adjust and be ready to take the test again. Its as if, when the plant is ready to start budding, she will also be ready.     	2	2		2																					
2639	4	The author concludes the story with that sentence a vowed to the flower. It�s just stating that Saeng will come back and try again next year & see if it works out with the hibiscus.	1	1		1																					
2640	4	The author put the paragraph in to show the he/she care about the flowers. Flowers only come out during spring and @DATE2 time and thats when you plant study all that grows in a garden. So she can pass the test and be happy with the garden.	1	0		1																					
2641	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus� ends the story with the paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" for a couple of reasons. Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she doesn�t want to be, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope."	2	2		2																					
2642	4	"In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,"" Saeng makes a vow to herself. �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� this vow means that she will start fresh, make changes, and adapt to her new life. She want disappoint her mother and she wont be broken down by her memories. She concluded the story like this to show in the future how her life will change and how she would learn to like where she is now."	2	1		2																					
2643	4	"The author concludes the story by the paragph that says, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again"", because the author wants to convey that. Saeng isn�t going to quit. She is determined to take and pass the test. It also meas that saeng will wait for the right moment to take the test. She will wait till things get better. The situation that she is in improves because it say�s, ""The snow melt, the geese return, and hibiscus is budding.�"	1	1		1																					
2644	4	The author concludes the story with this last paragraph because it shows by spring she will be ready to retake her test. It shows that like the geese who care and come back, she will have time to study and pass her test. In the story the author includes this last paragraph to truly show her dedication to eventually grow to be comfortable in her new home and to pass her drivers test all in good time. Saeng wants to be comfortable with her new life but isn�t yet because of what one misses. But she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter. This was a very effective way to end the story because it really communicated Saeng�s message of dedication and longing to overcome her obstacles, her new home and driving.  	2	3		3																					
2645	4	I think the author concludes like this because its almost like a new beginning. The ending of the story makes you think that Saeng is going to get on with her life. It makes me think that @CAPS1 plans to start her life over in comparison with the hibiscus. Once the plant �starts over� (rebuds) she will start over once again. It also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in @LOCATION1. She will not let her life be distraught by her move Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to start her life over again. The ending is a �cliff hanger� to show that her story has not yet completely ended. It shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life. It also shows she doesn�t let her failures control her. She is a strong young woman and is determined to overcome this. 	2	2		2																					
2646	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determind story. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2647	4	The author concludes the story this way to show that saeng intends to try again. an example of her trying again is when she sees the plant and relizes what it symbolizes to her. Another example is her saying that she wants to plant the hibiscas herself so that she holds the memories forever. This is why the author concludes the story in this manner.	1	1		1																					
2648	4	The author coNcludes the story with this paragraph because she was tryiNg to say siNce the hibiscus is plaNted we are goiNg to see how it does with the winter. ANd wheN spriNg arrives and it's still staNdiNg she caN go take the test. I thiNk the author was compariNg the hibiscus to their life aNd obstacles they will go through, so if the hibiscus is still staNdiNg theN that meaNs everythiNg will be fiNe to where she caN go back aNd take the test.	1	2		2																					
2649	4	The last paragraph of �Winter Hibiscus� describes determination and the growth of a person. Saeng says that when �this hibiscus is budding,  then I will take that test again.� Just as the hibiscus blooms Saeng will bloom forth and strive through the winter to try and succeed in passing her test. Saeng concludes by saying this as a realization that she can�t be sad forever. She must be determined in order to pass the test. The next season will be a sort of renewal, starting fresh and coming out beautiful as does a hibiscus in bloom.	2	2		2																					
2650	4	"The Author of �Winter Hibiscus�, Minfong Ho, concluded hes story with the paragraph about how when the geese are there, and the hibiscus is blooming, Saeng will take her drivers test again, because she wanted to end on a happy note. In the begining of the story, Saeng, who had just moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2, failed her drivers test. She had found a plant they had back in Vietnam, but it made her sad. �I mean it�s not like the kind we had at � at-"" she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� (Ho, @NUM1) So by ending by describing positive things for the future, Saeng could think about that, and get her mind off of everything else."	2	2		2																					
2651	4	"The author concludes the story with these paragraph for a very good reason. In away she just letting it go and will wait to take it again. I think that is a good that she found the flower. That is because it let her and her mother and in away make her better. For example when it say's"" the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."	1	1		1																					
2652	4	The author concludes the story this way to show how the main character, Saeng has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. It show a small amount of newfound confidence Saeng now has. This ending also shows how much of an effect the �Winter hibiscus� had on her. with bringing back memories of her old country. If Saeng wouldn�t have found the hibiscus, she would have never started to reminisce about her old home. This reminiscing not only reminded her of her past, but it also helped her compare her new home to her old home. Through this she realized that life in @LOCATION1 is not so bad, and that she still has a little bit of her old home with her everyday. This realization gave her just enough hope and confidence to want to try the driving test again This ending shows the change of heart Saeng feels for @LOCATION1 and her small gain of hope and confidence.  	3	2		3																					
2653	4	 The author decides to conclude the story with that because she wants the moral of the story to be burnt in your head. She believes that you will always have a chance to try again and the flower restarts its cycle and it gets another chance to bud and that symbolizes that you can start over and try again just like the girl is going to do on the test. She is doing the test again when the starts over so she can do. it with the flower and the flower budding will support her and give her hope.	2	2		2																					
2654	4	I believe that the author ends the story the way she did because it talk�s about both of the subjects. The author is trying to say that when she takes her driving test next spring the hibiscus will give her confidence to pass her driving test. The author	1	1		1																					
2655	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says �In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again�. She is saying that she wants to start over. and adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again. because she says �when the snow melts and the geese return.� She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way.	2	1		2																					
2656	4	I think the author concludes the story like that because its showing the time that will be passing. When it shows time passing, she�s grew up more and maybe she�ll be ready to take the test since now she knows how it is. Also because the hibiscus will be budding, that will make her feel more comfortable and relaxed because it all make her feel more like secure home feeling. �hibiscus is budding� this way the flower will be starting new and so will she.	2	1		2																					
2657	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she needs to adapt to the new country. She wants to wait when the hibiscus is budding. The plant budding shows than it is adapting to a new environment just like Saeng. The story shows that Saeng is not used to the new country. she cries when she sees the plants because it reminds her of her old home. The plant also comforts her. when she addapts to the new country, then she will take the test again.	1	2		2																					
2658	4	The author concludes this story with �when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again because Saeng didnt past her test and knew her mom would be mad so that why she got the flower. If she wouldn�t have failed her test she probably wouldn�t have got the flower in the first place.	1	1		1																					
2659	4	The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a vowe to herself because it shows how important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her determination because it reminds her of home. Saeng says �� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The hibiscus flower gives her confidence. It reminds her of her home in Vietnam before they moved to @LOCATION2. Therefore, the author concludes the story with that certain paragraph because it symbolizes the importance of the flower.	2	1		2																					
2660	4	She feels very connected  to this hibiscus plant because it renind her of her homeland.I think she is trying to say when the hibiscus plant shows it�s inner budding she will to. The plant has to try hard to produce flowers, and the seen has to care out to melt the snow, so that means when it comes around to it  she needs to comes out and melt all of her had habits and get what she meads to do to pass the test. But still not forgetting where she came from and all the memory left bedide. ��vowed silently to herself �then I will take that test again.��       	2	2		2																					
2661	4	In the story �winter @CAPS1� the author concludes the story with the last paragraph like that because when the season comes back around for budding she is going to be right back out there exsploring. She�s going to want to learn more about the hibiscus and what they do. And she can�t wait to start taking care of them as they start to bud. Thats why they ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2662	4	There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home. This is shown when she says �a blossom of two would have blown into the well� It reminds her of her homeland. It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she said�she realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.� This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing.	2	2		2																					
2663	4	The author is saying that she will be ready soon enuff when the flowers begin to grow and the geese begin to come home, she will be ready	1	1		1																					
2664	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she failed the driver's test. She is saying when it get's a little warmer outside and the plants grow in maybe she will then take the test again and hopefully pass. I know that she failed the test because it said"" As Saeng walks home after Failing  her driver's test"". I guess that from the snow  being on the ground cause her to  make mistakes when taking the test. In conclusion, that�s why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.."	1	1		1																					
2665	4	In �@CAPS1 Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to make a point. She needs all of those thing to happen for her to be sound enough to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2666	4	The author ended the story this way because the plant represents new beginnings in which Saeng needs. Seang failed her test & needed some comfort. She went to the greenhouse & spent @MONEY1 on a hibiscus plant that reminded her of her home. It the same time the hibiscus plant reminded her that her new home is another new beginning. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng better hopes that starting over can be a good thing & that the next time she takes the test, she'll pass.	2	1		2																					
2667	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 reason why he does is because he wants to conclude by writing about geese. Second he like plants and the season�s that they bud. He vowed that he would take that test in the spring. He cant wait until the snow melts so that way he can take the test.	1	1		1																					
2668	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph is because she wants that same envioronment and everything she wanted before when she took the test	0	0		0																					
2669	4	The author�s choice of words in the conclusion of the story, I believe sent of let the reade knew that the story continues. But, I think that the test is that to remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
2670	4	The Author @CAPS1 the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself. in the spring, when the snow melt and the gees return and this Hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She @CAPS1 it with this because she begins the story with Saeng Failing Her Driver license test. and also she was think that the Winter Hibiscus was good luck after it goes away and how she & fimerlary with @CAPS3 which would be the geese she put @CAPS3 together and thats why she said when the geese comes back and the snow melts......That is why she said it.  	1	1		1																					
2671	4	I think Saeng concluded with this story because there is always time to make up for the past if the past allows you to meaning that @CAPS1 didn�t past the test. I fell she met that �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to me this means that even though it is snowing outside there is always next spring to start growing back up the vegetable garden this also relates to Saeng even though she failed the test there is always another change we can make up for that lost and retry and try to succeed at this one.	1	1		1																					
2672	4	"The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with this sentence when they come back saeng vowed silently to her self in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The Winter Hibiscus symbolizes her fondness of the place she used to live before. Its not a real one I�m mean not the kind we had at-at� she was still too shaky to say the words at home� when the hibiscus buds� she will still be fond of her home but she will have adapted better to her current enviroment. The geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day. When she finds that place she will find herself ready to �take the test"" or do things normally. The author concluded the story with the that sentence to show that Saeng will eventually grow into her new life."	3	2		3																					
2673	4	The author concluded the story like that because she was being positive. Like the geese are coming back she is positive that she can take the test again. She knows that she will pass the test. In the story she said �Many things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet reptition of season upon season, almost familiar to hernow� This means that when she had just moved here she thought that everything was strange because, she have not seen anything like this before. Now as she is living here to would get use to it because, she knows what will happen nothing will become strange to her anymore since this is her home now	1	2		2																					
2674	4	The reader thinks the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the girl is saying she will try again, and take that test. In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� Saeng, the girl tock a test and failed it. And she got this flower that brong back memories from the past and decied She tock take this test now that thing are going to get better again. Also when the girl saw those geese flying over her, she knew they will be coming back, coming back after winter in the spring, and when they do her flower will blossom, the one that brings back good memories from the past and she will retake that test and past. Those are some examples of why I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2675	4	The author concludes the story with that story because she loves her homeland and love�s nather and loves her mother. She loves the greeness and cant wait in tell spring comes. so she will take the test of being out of place to herself, that is why she concluds the story that way. 	1	1		1																					
2676	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well, but leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action.	1	1		1																					
2677	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says �In the spring when the snows melt� because she is beginning to get used to �the quiet repetition of season upon season�. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.     	2	2		2																					
2678	4	When they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author�s main porpuse of this lines wa to grab the readers attention by making a continuing paragraph that a closing she�s adapting to circumstances. Saeng values the uniqueness of plants, she is also conforted by memories of her homeland	1	1		1																					
2679	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to conclude that she will wait a little bit of time, until plants can be be planty so if she fails again, she will have something to hold on to. For example, when Saeng �failed the @NUM1) she try to overcome the feeling of failing, by buying something that reminds her of her country and bring back the memories to past thro this time. Another example is when Saeng �felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral (@NUM2),she forgot about everything that was happening in her life, from moving to @LOCATION1 to failing her test this feeling concentratted her on feeling like home again. In conclusion, the author conclusion, creates the belief that that the was Saeng gets over her problems is by remembering memories like the plant, that reminded her of her home country.	2	2		2																					
2680	4	I believe that the author concludes the story this way to snow that Saeng  will be of next year . She  said now all the new  @CAPS1 things seemed  weird to her when she first got here , but now  they are second nature to her now  . I think that  the  hibiscus is an can of  hope and inspiration to her . I  think  that she finally realizes  that  she  is in  @LOCATION1 to stay  and  she  can  go  back to  vietnam . So she has to accept  that  she  is  here home  and I think she  is  on her  way  to  doing  that .	2	2		2																					
2681	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she has faith for a new start. Saeng compares herself to the hibiscus. When the, �hibiscus is @NUM1), she will retake the test. This shows that when the hibiscus restarts its life, so will she. Saeng feels that when the hibiscus is �strong enough to make it through the cold @NUM2), then she is strong enough to pass her driver�s test and live in a new country. Winter and cold represent death, and spring represent a new life or beginning. Saeng thinks to herself, �in the spring� I will take the test @NUM3). This is a new beginning for Saeng, a new hope.	2	3		3																					
2682	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�by Minfong Ho,the author  decided  to  end  it  with  the  sentence   �when they come back, Saeng  vowed  silently  to herself,  in   the  spring. When  the snows  melt and the geese  return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, because  it show that even though the main character Saeng, @MONTH1 a failed once, she will trying again too. The  geese  will  be coming back to try out a  new  spring  and  the  hibiscus  will be budding new flowers so its like its starting over again as well and Saeng  says  that  if  both  have  made it once they tried again then   she can as well but this time she will succeed. Also, it shows the  determination  all  living  things  have  to  succeed at their main purpose. .The  flower  drivers  to re-bud. The  geese  drive  at  coming back  again  during  the  spring and the main character  drives  at  passing  the  test.The author of �Winter Hibiscus,�Minfong Ho,put that quote as the last  line of  the  story  for  inspiration.To  inspire  people  to  continue  the  path of life and if  you fail are task,try again.So the author gives you inspiration to help you continue to live your life	3	3		3																					
2683	4	In the last paragraph of the story, Saeng vows to herself that she will take the driving test again in the spring. The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the hope that nature brings to her. She describes peaceful things in nature, like the geese and hibiscus, that she draws strength from because they remind her to her homeland. In this way, she�ll always have a little piece of her past with her. Throughout the story, Saeng relates to nature and pulls strength from it. Her mother has a garden, and she relates to it in that she has a different past, preferring natural foods like bitter melons over @LOCATION1. This final paragraph shows the hope that the beautiful nature from her homeland has brought to Saeng, helping her adapt to living in a new place.   	2	3		3																					
2684	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she�ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she�ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn�t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  	1	1		1																					
2685	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new life style. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change.	2	2		2																					
2686	4	The author includes this  because he�s using metaphors to explain how the author felt about Saeng�s personal life is	0	0		0																					
2687	4	The author concludes the story with paragraph because it shows Saeng�s sympathy. She wants to help her mom with the garden because she dissappointed her. For instance, she feels bad about upsetting her mom, and while her mom�s gardening, she says, �Here, let me help, mother,� because her mom�s frail beauty touched her. When Saeng told her mom she failed the driving test, she even knew not to look at her because she was upset, it says, �Saeng didn�t dare look her mother in the eye,� which shows Saeng�s concern for her mother�s reaction. However, in the end, her mother was happy she got it, saying, �It�s a beautiful plant, I�m glad you got it,� which shows the mother and daughter have a close relationship. This is why Saeng�s sympathy to better   herself is shown in the story�s conclusion.	1	1		1																					
2688	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� is about a young girl who cares for gardening over schoolwork. The given conclusion is explaining, when spring comes, and the winter hibiscus is gone, she will pass the school test she failed before. Saeng only cares for the winter Hibiscus right now, for example, the line �I paid over nineteen dollars for it.� Explains she used all her money on this plant rather than any other food. Also the quote �I failed the test� with Saeng crying shows she failed it only because she was worrying about the hibiscus. In conclusion over the spring, when the winter hibiscus is gone, Saeng will focus on school more rather than gardening. Maybe now she will pass her test and go back to her hobby of gardening.	1	1		1																					
2689	4	The author has a good reason in which she concludes the story with this. The main character of the story, Saeng, moves to the united states from Vietnam and fails her drivers test. Saeng has not adapted to the life in the united states and when she sees a firmilar hibiscus plant she buys if for her memory�s of Vietnam. The author is trying to show that since saeng planted the hibiscus during winter, when it blooms in spring she will be ready to try to pass her drivers test because she will have adapted the life in the united states. The theme of the story would be if you are moving away from somewhere you grew up in, bring things that remind you of that place so you still have a little of that culture with you. Therefore the author begins and ends with the same subject.	1	2		2																					
2690	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with a sentence about retaking the drivers test in the spring, to express the themes of adopting to circumstances and determination to succeed. The main character in the story, Saeng, is a @CAPS1 immigrant. Because @CAPS2 is not her homeland, there are still many aspects of life here she is not accustomed to, and the story shows her struggle to adapt. For instance when she sees the flower �Madagascar penwinhle� she thinks �how strange to see it in a pot� because �Back home it just grows wild,� The last sentence of the story is symbolic when it says �and the geese return,� because the geese adapt to circumstances by flying south for the winter, just like Saeng is trying to do, and Saeng realizes their pattern are becoming familiar. The very last line says �I will take that test again.� This summarizes the determination Saeng has throughout the entire story. Not only is she determined to succeed in her driver�s test, but in other things as well. For example, when trying to plant the hibiscus Saeng observes that �the soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting her shovel into it. Despite the difficulty, though, she �Dug out a hole� and knows it�s strong enough to move it through the cold months just like Saeng will be strong enough to overcome obstacles if she tries. The last sentence in the story is significant. It expresses important themes and lends valuable insight into Saeng�s character.  	3	3		3																					
2691	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph to set the sonip theme. In the story, the @CAPS1 represents very important thing to saeng � confidence, beauty, adaptation� some things she can apply to herself, & her memories of her old homeland. She had failed the driving test. Afterwards, she bought the @CAPS1 to comfort her homesickness. I saw the @CAPS1 as a sort of metaphor to Saeng the same @CAPS1, but growing differently in a different area just as she is still the same but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the @CAPS1 budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland by the @CAPS1 blossoming ,it can represent her love for the homeland. When the author wrote �then I will take that test again� it is referring to the new confidence she @MONTH1 have later when the @CAPS1 blooms (another @CAPS1 /person metaphor)	3	3		3																					
2692	4	The author @PERSON1, concludes the story ��Winter Hibiscus with that paragraph to show Saeng starting over��� In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�@CAPS1 to her life, is that she is starting fresh in a way. Although she @MONTH1 miss her old life, her grandmother, the well, and the fine toothed comb, She is making on effort and ��take that test again��� By relating the test she shows that she is not ready to give in to the �� @CAPS2 of loss.�� and to her grief.     	2	2		2																					
2693	4	The author ends the story with �when they back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� because she is concluding that the hibiscus comforts her and once once the plant is well and alive, she will be comfortable to take the test. In reality, seeking comfort from a plant seems nieve but its not that she has comfort in the plant itself but that the hibiscus reminds her of her home in which she misses dearly. Once the plant is thriving, as such as her tropical home, she believes that it will comfort her enough to pass the test. In conclusion, this is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2694	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how as the plant will grow, so will Saeng . After failing the drivers test, saeng goes to the greenhouse and finds the Hibiscus plant which reminds her of her true home back in Vietnam when they had similar plants. The plant then makes her think about all the memories and she is comforted by them even though she is said. She uses this plant as a tool for comfort  to  help  her think about when she is from and all the good memories to help raise her spirits higher. So to boost her confidence  she decides to plant it. �The �winter hibiscus� was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around. �Then she sees geese flying in the sky which  is kind of a symbol do that day, something to rembember  it by, so the next year.� When the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� She will take the test again. These things bring back good memories which help to make her stronger.	3	2		3																					
2695	4	I think Saeng need to take the test over because to get her grade up. Saeng be waring about the snow, in the spirng because she is think about the flower getting cover over it. Saeng mother late her help with the pepper and melons, and lat her state dinner.	0	0		0																					
2696	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wants us to know that she�s not giving up on her test. The author wants to inform the readers that she�s not giving up ��then I will take that teat again� which clearly states she still has hope. Author wants to continue on her test to find the right flower. This is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2697	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because during winter everything dies down till springs where everything is lively again, the Saeng would feel more motivated to do well on the test. Saeng is sort of like the plant, strives and worries in the winter and then blooms beautifully in the spring.  Also, I think the memories that the winter hibiscus plant brought her; motivated  her to stop staying in the past and move on towards the future.	2	1		2																					
2698	4	He  wrote this  because  he is talking  about weather changes	0	0		0																					
2699	4	The author probably conclude the story with that paragraph b/c she is basically relating the plants to herself meaning as the plant bloom she will too by taking the test. and her reason could be b/c or is b/c reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Basically she did as the geese by lifting her head watching as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance. This is why I believe the author but this to conclde the story...because she was comparing herself ib the geese and does as they did 	1	2		2																					
2700	4	The author describes last quote because he wants her dream to achieve. We describes �she realized that many of the things that she had thought the quiet repetition of season, almost familiar to her now. Saeng is from Vietnam, and her family have an @CAPS1 dream. so the author wants that her family adapt their new life in @LOCATION2.	1	1		1																					
2701	4	She says this because right now it is winter and flowers can grow in the winter due to how cold it is. So she is saying when spring is back she will take the test of growing the flowers again. In conclusion, this is why the author states that conclusion at the end of the paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2702	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph to give you a sense of hope and determination for the future that dwells within saeng at that time .Throught  the story is seemed as though saeng was giving into despair at the remembrance of her home land ,she wasnt doing so well in her new country and and she had realized it the  most when she had �failed her driving test �.but when she  walked past the flower shop and saw all the plants that used to bloom so freely and beautifly  in her home  land comfind  in those ting pots and fighting to survive it reminded her of  herself here in @LOCATION1. As she began to plant her hibiscus she again compared herself to it and that is why when her plant blooms on the spring so well she will pass that test   	2	3		3																					
2703	4	The author conclude this saying it to the story because he thought it would go because at valkay about how the hibisuse a yet budding in the winter & and how all at the geese will return to the home and stay there because they hate the winter.  	1	1		1																					
2704	4	The author concludes the story using that paragraph for a few reasons. One reason why is because the change in Saeng�s attitude. In the beginning of the story Saeng is upset and has no hope of adjusting to her new home, but by adding that paragraph at end of the story it shows that she has hope, and she�s not going to give up. Another reason why this paragraph concludes the story is to show that life does go on in toughest situation. The fact that a new season will begin figuratively shows Saeng will not always feel this way that she too will change. In conclude the story with that paragraph for a few good reasons.	2	2		2																					
2705	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph I think because since the girl failed her test the bud reminds her of her grandmothers long grey hair and I guess that gives her good luck so when the winter passes by and the spring time hits thats buds start to come back out and thats when she will take her test again. Thats why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story.	1	2		2																					
2706	4	I am going to tell you why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. One reason the author does is because it tells you that Saeng is confident. It also tells you she wont give up. And it shows that she is willing to take her ability to the next level. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
2707	4	"THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY INTENDED TO SHOW THE HOPEFUL ENLIGHTENMENT OF SAENG'S COMPLEX DILEMMA. IN THE PHRASE, ""WHEN THEY COME BACK"" THE AUTHOR MUST LIKELY REFERS TO THE HIBISCUS FLOWERS THAT REPRESENT THE FOND MEMORIES OF HER HOMELAND. THE AUTHOR ILLUSTRATES SAENG'S STRUGGLE ADAPTING TO HER NEW LIFE THROUGH A �TEST� OF PLANTING THE BUDS JUST AS SHE HAD DONE BACK HOME WITH HER GRANDMOTHER. THIS TEST REPRESENTS THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ADAPTATION TO HER NEW LIFE. FOR THAT REASON, THE AUTHOR CONCLUDED HER STORY WITH THE PARAGRAPH INDICATING SAENG WILL INDEED TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN."	1	2		2																					
2708	4	The author decided to conclude the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s determination to adapt to her new life. In the third paragraph on the second page the author writes, �Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile� That atleast, she could hold onto.� After failing her driver�s test Saeng was feeling foreign and alone. She desperately looked to the flower as a reminder of her homeland, Vietnam. The flower brought back comforting memories for her, so she bought one of the plants and returned. After a discussion with her mother Saeng understands that she must cope with her new home, much like the flower must adapt to its new surroundings. By concluding the story, with that stated sentence, the author is informing the reader that Saeng must �blossom� in her new home in order to do well. She still needs time for this, as the flowers needs time to plant its roots into the ground.	3	3		3																					
2709	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Maybe to show confidence that she would do everything over again if she had to. For example ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", so basically she's saying she's willing to take that step, that chance . The author ended the story with this confidence and couragement.."	1	1		1																					
2710	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take the test again.� She does this to end in hope of taking the test again and doing good. Also the author ends it this way because Saeng is believing in herself so she made a vowe to do something. Hopefully that will encourage her more and also motivate her.	1	1		1																					
2711	4	The author of this story concludes the story with a paragraph basically stating that the winters coming things are going to die off then come back next spring. Shes refering to the plant. I think she is basically keeping track of the memories it left her and the thoughts that came to mind when she used her senses to connect with the flower. Saeng is ancious to see how the flower buds next spring and what other new things she @MONTH1 experience.	1	1		1																					
2712	4	Well I think the author concludes the story like that because he is showing her her attitude better known now she is changing so she is going to put her mind to whatever she has to do and she is going to take the test again with some pride and try in the spring when the snow goes away.	1	1		1																					
2713	4	The author decides to end the story with the paragraph to show many things. First of all, the author uses the ending paragraph to show optimism. The whole story had been sad but the ending shows some hope. In the beginning it says, � @CAPS1  of loss so deep� �(@NUM1) and at the end it says, � I will take that test again.� (@NUM2) shows how her  attitude   changes from cynical to hopeful. Another reason why the story is ended with that paragraph is to show how Saeng was accepting. When the story says that the geese were  , � almost familiar to her now.�(@NUM2) demonstrates that even though Saeng is sad to leave her home, she is adapting quite well. Therefore, the author ends the story with an inspiring paragraph to show change for the better.	2	2		2																					
2714	4	"The author is concluding the story with that parapraph stating when spring and @DATE2 comes again then she will take the test again. Meaning she will plant the flowers and get them to grow again. Hoping she don�t fail at doing so. For example, ""Mrs. Lambert, liked it. this sharp bitter melon that left a golden after taste on the tongue.�"	1	0		1																					
2715	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants to end it on a good note and send a good message there not going to quit because they failed the first time.	1	1		1																					
2716	4	I say the only reason why the author included that last paragraph was to show she was not going to give up easy. She was still going to take it again, she might get good luck from the hibiscus. Saeng was walking home one day from failing her driver�s test and she realizes that she recognizes a flower so she went to a florist to see if she can buy it. When she does purchase it she goes home and gives it to her mom and they plant it. So maybe it can bring back good memories from her home town or just good luck I think.	1	2		2																					
2717	4	The author concludes the story wt this passage because its symbolic. When the Geese come back in the spring it will be like a now beginning. When the Hibiscus is budding it has a new life. When all this happens Saeng will have a new fresh start too. Leaving the story to end like this is a cliff-hanger for some. It makes you wanting more, knowing she failed her test you want to know if Saeng will pass it in the spring, @CAPS1 a fresh new start. Everything and everyone will have new starts when the beginning of the new season comes around when the hibiscus blooms it will be like she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, new connections w/her past and comfort during hard times. The Hibiscus symbolizes all this	3	2		3																					
2718	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this is what the story was all about. Saeng saw what happens in the winter and when it comes back around she trys to memorize it so that she can no what will happen.	0	0		0																					
2719	4	The author ends the story this way because by the time winter ends she will have adapted to her new society, just like the hibiscus.	1	1		1																					
2720	4	"The young girl Saeng from the story ""Winter Hibiscus� by minfong Ho, has moved from her home land of Vietnam to the United States. The young girl was hoping to get her drivers license but failed, The hibiscus she sees comforts her reminding her of Vietnam. When she purchases it her mother is concern of the price but sees how home sick her daughter is and becomes understanding. After planting the Hibiscus She watches the geese and understands that every year they change their habitat. The geese inspire Saeng along with the Hibiscus and promises herself that"" in the spring when the snow melts away the geese return and thes Hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."	2	2		2																					
2721	4	The author uses this paragraph because it works perfectly as an end. Wit  this saeng tell @LOCATION1 that all the snow is gone she will take the test again. If one read   now between the lives it   says more than just this. She really likes the hibiscus and when the hibiscus goes back to life in the spring, she will have new energy to take the test again. From her experience with the hibiscus we can see that this plant really influent her. Because this  plant reminds  her so much of her old home.  Also we can see that everything and everybody should get a second chance. In her case it is the test she wants to take again. Also in the spring she lives a couple month in the @LOCATION1 and she will adjust herself to this new situation. At the moment she is just homesick, even if her home is the @LOCATION1 now. So the hibiscus is good for her, it is some think she can hold onto from her old home� 	2	2		2																					
2722	4	The author: minfong Ho, finishes the story like this to show the overcoming of obstacles. The story shows the many difficulties saeng faces when leaving her old home and comming to her new one. In the day described. She failes a drivers test, doesn�t eat lunch with her friend, and spends all her money on a plant from her old home. Also, this paragraph shows how the Hibiscus symbolizes her. The plant is not in its native home, faces many difficulties; the cold its small pot, and even its general surrounding. In every way, the plant is in the same circumstances as main character and the last paragraph is used to link them.   	3	2		3																					
2723	4	The reason why the author used this paragraph is because he was sag that the snow go away in spring time that all.	0	0		0																					
2724	4	The last paragraph means only one thing. That one thing is to be like a Hibiscus @CAPS1 to take the test again of life. See will come back in the spring just like the Hibiscus will. So as you can see the last paragraph had a very good meaning to it.	1	1		1																					
2725	4	The auther concluded the story with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is willing to change and she wants to do so by the time spring comes. By change Saeng wants to feel comfertable in @LOCATION1 and be able to remember things from where she used to live and not have to break down and cry. Also the author use the geese because they need to leave home earely year and they deal with it so Saeng can deal with it as well.	1	1		1																					
2726	4	"The reason why the author ends the story with that statement is because when you fail at something you need time to dust yourself off and try again. When Saeng fails her driving test she is disappointed. After failing her test she went too greenery where she saw flowers of her homeland. Then where sh bought the hibiscus. It reminded her of how things were different. And how thing change when you go to different place. Sometimes they aren't so pleasant at first but you get use to them. Like when she first saw the geese flying in a ""V"". she though of how strange it was. But now it is farmiliar to her. After failing her driving test Saeng learns that even though things nav change she needs to be able to try again. "	2	2		2																					
2727	4	She concluded the paragraph with that paragraph to show that she is serious about her gardening and that she won�t garden until geese come back.	1	1		1																					
2728	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did, because Saeng is a nature freak. So she really likes nature and she would never ever hurt nature in her life and I guess that they wanted to end off with a nice paragraph. So she needs to take that test again.	0	0		0																					
2729	4	The author concludes this story because it shows her determination. It says that she will keep on attempting to make an adjustment to her life till she accepts her new home. It also says that as the buds grow so will she. But her more mentally then physically. And her taking the test again is meaning that she has faith in herself that she will mature and grow up to be a person who misses their home land but accepts the new home that they live in. That is why the author ended this way.	2	2		2																					
2730	4	She is saying here that she will start a new leaf when spring comes around she is going to start a new leaf and she is going to do better on her driving test. I think she concluded with this paragraph because this shows that Saeng is not a quiter and she going to try harder. 	1	1		1																					
2731	4	Reserved need to check keenly	3	3		3																					
2732	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the cold was brufield or the  author never  wanted to be around while the cold was in sesion. At the  time it was realy cold	0	0		0																					
2733	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One being the fact that she wants to snow sympathay for the hibiscus. Another reason would be showing that Saeng wants to make her mother very proud of her. Meaning that she doesn�t want her mom to think that she is going to give up. This also contributes to the reason that Saeng believes in herself and she truly thinks she can pass the test. Lastly I think that this last paragraph snowed how Saeng wants people to know that even some as small and meaning less as a plant can help her overcome obsticles, and lead her to her dreams. The author chose this paragraph to end the story because of the main fact that how we know that Saeng will not stop believing in herself.    	2	2		2																					
2734	4	"The author of the story, chooses to end the story with that sentence because the story is mainly about how Saeng failed her drivers test, but when she saw the hibiscus, it reminded her of home and made her feel better. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng says, �And that rich, sweet scent � that was familiar too,"" talks about how nice the flowers were and how familiar they were because she reconized the scent. Saeng was already upset about leaving her home in @LOCATION1, then coming to @LOCATION2 and then failing her drivers test, just made it worse, but then she saw the flower and it reminded her of her home, so she felt a little better. So when the author uses that quote, they end the story that way to show that she will have enough courage to try again when the flower blooms."	2	3		3																					
2735	4	The author concludes the story like that to show emphasis.Saeng vowed that so that it will teach her everything lives with hope & adaptation. She means that when everything returns and proves they survive, she will too. She will take that drivers test then. The author also wants to prove that people need to have faith in theirselves. You just need to get used to their surroundings. This is why the author concluded that way.	1	2		2																					
2736	4	"In stories, author lend them many different ways with many different effects. In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a �touching� affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story. The first example, is in the beginning of the conclusion, it says �Saeng vowed silently to herself�. In this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story. ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again� This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout, the geese in the end, and the failing of the test in the beginning. In conclusion, that�s why the author used that paragraph as the conclusion for such a touching story."	2	2		2																					
2737	4	The author concludes in the story that Saeng failed a winter test and because of her love of the hibiscus plant spring will help her take test.	1	1		1																					
2738	4	I belive the author concludes the story with this paragraph because. She wanted the reader to know that just because she failed that it doesn�t mean her lifes over. She will requperate and to the same thing next year.	1	1		1																					
2739	4	The author uses this paragraph to conclude to show she�s going to give the test another try as well as her new surroundings. For example the story says �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon, almost fimiliar to her now�. Saying that she is getting used to where she is now and wants and is willing to give it a chance. Almost as if she doesn�t find it that bad as she thought at first it being different and not her home and where she was used to being.  	2	2		2																					
2740	4	Maybe the author wrote that as the last sentence or paragraph because in the story she did something and failed at it, so she wants to do it again.	1	1		1																					
2741	4	The Author of �Winter Hibiscus� ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant �dies� in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle.	2	2		2																					
2742	4	"After reading the quote ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test. From the story ""winter' Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, I think the author is trying to say that after the winter and fall pass she will be upto the challenge to plant again and feel good about herself. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive ""V"" was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. Reflecting back I feel Saeng felt that the geese was secretly letting her know what she was doing was right."	1	1		1																					
2743	4	He ends the story this way to show that she wants to and is willing to overcome leaving her homeland. In the story she goes to a green house. She is in the green house to test herself. She finds a plant from her homeland and and it reminds her of her grandmother. She finds other plants and they remind her of her homeland and she cries. I think she had a real connection with her grandmother. When they left their home country she probably cried for days its like she lost a part of her sole.	1	1		1																					
2744	4	The author includes this paragraph into the story because the girl started giving up on herself and felt sad from moving to the United States and also from failing her drivers test, but lastly about the plant that she bought that wasn�t real. Also because he wanted to show that her self esteem had gone up and that she was more confident and wasn�t gonna give up on herself.	1	1		1																					
2745	4	The author leaves the story with those words, because it shows the reader a large metaphor in the story, although unfinished, it is self-explantory that the �metaphor� compares Saeng and her test to the perenial nature of the winter hibiscus. They both have something in common, which is that they both come back, Saeng comes back to complete her test, while the winter hibiscus comes back, buds, and lives again. I can relate to this, because I remember I entered in a triathalon, and my goal was to place first, I place @NUM1 overall, then next year came, and I trained until the triathalon came again, and I placed @NUM2, so like the winter hibiscus, I came back and completed my goal.    	1	2		2																					
2746	4	The Author includes that part in his story because it�s talking about na ture and a the beuttifl thing's in natural. Ther�s the @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, tall green grass the white @CAPS3 fence and in the story there are those sanne type's of things that been in nature.	0	0		0																					
2747	4	The author views the hibiscus plant as a new start. For example, when she says �In the spring, whch the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 she failed the first time and got the plant the next time she�ll pass it.	1	1		1																					
2748	4	The author include these paragraph in the story because the it spring, when the snows melt and the geese return. I think the author is talk about winter when it snows and keep snowing until spring hit and then the snow start to melt a way because the sun came out. One reason, is the author is talk about how it change weather when it changes.	0	0		0																					
2749	4	She was upset with herself because she bought the hibicus and not the plant seeds. So she starts crying because she remembered how pretty their old one used to be. When the snow melts and the flowers start to bloom is when she is going to take the test again. The author ended the paragraph like that to show a new begining next year.	1	1		1																					
2750	4	I believe that she included this because she wanted to show important it was to her. For example when she says in the spring she will take the test again. I think that ment she will work harder to make sure she does everything right. So that she can say she follows through on things that are important to her. These are my thoughts on why she included this paragraph in the story.	1	1		1																					
2751	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because 1. Saeng failed the test. @NUM1. It takes time for a hibiscus to bud. @NUM2. It sound like a good end i not and plus she would not want to take the test in the snow.	1	1		1																					
2752	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know that how Saeng @CAPS1 about the hibiscus. I thinks the author concludes this because he his telling the reader that the hibiscus gives saeng goodluck and with this good luck She will past the test. In the story it tells us how much saeng adores the plant For example when she got to the hibiscus She reached out and toched a petal gently. It Felt smooth and cool. Thats why the author use thal paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng @CAPS1 and how it make her  feel confident.	1	1		1																					
2753	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to leave readers guessing and wondering what will be next. You can tell by the tone of the last paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author seems to leave at tone of suspense.	1	1		1																					
2754	4	By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story �winter Hibiscus,� the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of seang at her struggle to live in another country & her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating statement on the test saying � I will take that test again,� the author gives us that understanding that Saeng has not given up & lets the reader know she will stand & live strong.	2	2		2																					
2755	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is becaus now she has something to work for. The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph becaus she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could wait to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are reasons why i think the author put that conclude with the paragraph.	1	2		2																					
2756	4	The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simpley set a time for her to try again. Saeng wants to make it in this world and wants to have a good life, so she tries new things	1	1		1																					
2757	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� is a good-day story about a foreign girl trying to adapt to @LOCATION1. She likes tropical flowers. The reason why the author chose to write the last paragraph like that is because it finishes the story right. That ending when the goes man away and the flowers start to grow she will try to fit in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2758	4	I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because it�s  meaning fail odvestily Saeng  really like garden and it�s  something  special to her . Also when all the snow  melts  she  will  take  the test  and  hopfully get her drivers  licesies.	1	1		1																					
2759	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because new beginnings.What I mean by this is,the hibiscus represents new beginnings.She says �When the hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again �.This will be a new start for her  .The plant  blooming makes her happy and reminds her of her grandmother.She�s saying by the time the spring comes around she  would be ready for a  new obstacle as so for the hibiscus plant.	2	2		2																					
2760	4	I believe the author chooses to end the story wit this paragraph because it symbolizes closure. The plant represent her home. But she realizes  by the sight of the geese, flying sooth that evenyone has to leave home at some point. She has now come to terms with what is happening and she will try again for her drivers liscence soon. When the hibiscus buds again it will by symbolic to her and that is when she will be ready to try once again.	1	2		2																					
2761	4	"I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she�s showing she is trying she wants another chance. She realized her mistake�s and ready to start over, Even though she faild by trying to grow her hibiscus in the winter she is trying to start over when the @DATE1 comes in. for example in the story. It stated the ""winter hibiscus"" was in the ground now, and saeng tamped down the soil around it over head, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and yes familiar to saeng snow. That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	1	1		1																					
2762	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks it�ll bring her good luck in the test. When she goes back to take the test she�ll have the comfort of her home land of the hibiscus plant to encourage her to pass the driving test. When she takes the test again she�ll ve mast to pass due to the comfort of home and she�ll be used to the area being different from her homeland. In order for her to do well in the test she needs something to help her have a little but more confident in herself. Having things to remind her of home and the house that she lives at now can help her a lot in being confident in herself.	2	1		2																					
2763	4	She said that she was going to take the test agen because to show her mom that she can do it and Past it this time. instad of worring over her old home.	1	1		1																					
2764	4	I think that this snows hope because she had really missed her homeland and kind of found peace and serenity by being around them she says �That at least she could hold on to� meaning the bud I think that she was very upset because of missing home she missed having her grandmother wash her hair and put a dok mallk into it. I think that since she really had nothing else but the flowers that reminded of her homeland the text said �where was the fine toothed come the hibiscus hedge, the well. her gentle grandmother she was missing all these thing so I think that by putting her in this posistion it has brought her to a place of where she not only misses the people from her homeland but the beautiful things as well and how she always has kind of a part of home with her because of the flower.	2	2		2																					
2765	4	"In the last paragraphy the reason why the author uses ""when they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test. The author uses this because Saeng finally had found comfort. after  moving from a her homeland veelnam to the united States, she felt home sick. For example, she comes across this flower that reminds her of the time she spent in her homeland. She remember he grandmother's smell because of the plant. So when she finally got home to her mother, she showed the flower to her. They both planted the flower, and @CAPS1 got a sense of relief. Thats why she vowed that when winter was oven and spring came she would take that test, because she had a sense of home in her, that gave her uncouragement and strength. it also shows that even when your are in a different area and you are chew, there's always something that can male you remember the unemove and lime spent where you can from"	2	2		2																					
2766	4	The author concludes the story like this because it show that she is determined to do pass the test. It is also like if the birds can fly south she can pass that test.	1	1		1																					
2767	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author does this for several reasons. The author wants to show you that Saeng still has hope and that she believes she can make it right. Also, to show Saeng will still try and adapt to her surrounding and make friends. Saeng is also, determined that she will pass the test next time she takes it. Last it is emphazing the conflict and how Saeng overcame it.	2	1		2																					
2768	4	"I believe the author ended this story with this paragraph because life lives on. ""When the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" proves that shes moving on with life and so will all the creature in the world. Also even knew she moved to a new country doesn�t mean she cant still enjoy the things from her homeland, �but she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to the Big Mac.� thats why the author put that last paragraph to show that life lives on.  "	2	2		2																					
2769	4	The author concludes the story w/this paragraph because she really isnt worried about when they take the test again, she�s only concerned w/the plants she picked out. Also, she knows that it will be a really long time before she takes the test again so that gives her more time to study and get more prepared and focused. The author also ends this article w/this paragraph because she wants to let the readers know that since she failed the @NUM1 time she will be back again to take it over and nothing will stop the author from failing.	1	1		1																					
2770	4	It shows not to give up, it ends almost  the same way it began, it shows that people should not stay too attached to the past each are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then she will try again later to pass it. Also the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to which is a good way of writing. One last thing is that it shows that people shouldn�t become too attached to the past because if they look at one thing that reminds them of it they @MONTH1 fall apart, that is why she takes the test, to see if she can look at the familiar flowers without falling apart.   	2	2		2																					
2771	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to end on a happy yet motivating note. In the story Saeng says that she failed the test and was very dissapointed with herself. The test must have of been very important to her for her to be so dissapointed. The author also probably ended with this paragraph to show that Saeng is devoted in passing this test. Saeng seems like a sentemental yet reliable person. I believe that the test is to spend a minimal amount of money and she wants to earn respect from her mom. That is why taking and passing the test seems so important to Saeng. That is why the author ended with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2772	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author concludes the story with the lines �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason that the author concludes the test with these lines is because she is re-establing the symbolism of the plant. In the text it said that the plant budds in the spring, once it has time to grow and adapt to the new enviroment. Just as the plant needed that time so did the main character Saeng. She just moved from Vietnam and failed her drivers test. Saeng is very unsure of her new culture. For example she likes bitter melon it says. �But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself much prefered it to a Big Mac.� She appears to think she is misunderstood an no one likes her, but just as the plant will adapt to this new life so will she.	3	3		3																					
2773	4	"The auther conclude the story by saying she will take the test again in the spring and uptill then vow silently because the spring reminded Saeng of home. In Vietnam there were many beautiful wild flowers. Sarng goes to the flower shop to get a peice of home. It said the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind.� This shows that the plant was not the same because there were also no buds. She had just failed her driving test before this and needed hope, so al waiting till spring when the hibiscus will bloom again that will give Saeng a sense of home which will give her hope to do good on the driving test. "	2	2		2																					
2774	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng whole world is the plants a since they are gone there is no motivation.	0	0		0																					
2775	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author�s reasoning for saying this is because the presence of memories from Saeng�s homeland comforts her. So much that they she will pass her test with ease because she will not be nervous. �it was like walking into another world,� said Saeng, when she entered the florist shop, after failing her drivers test. It was almost as if she completely forgot about failing and was only thinking about the plants, flowers. The flowers take her to a happy peace and make her feel at home. Like everything is going to be alright. This is  why the author concludes with such a sentence because us as readers should show memories of her farmland will help her pass her drivers test.  	2	3		3																					
2776	4	The author @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because of the titel and the begening of the story. Or he @MONTH1 have conclude the story like that because he wants to. He @MONTH1 have concluded the story like that to show what @MONTH1 happen. But is good conclusion is a good conclusion. 	0	0		0																					
2777	4	I really do not know why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Possibly because she started to talk.	0	0		0																					
2778	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng�s determination. Saeng has been through a lot and misses what its like at home. She feels different and out of place but she is still strong. Life goes on, and this paragraph shows that Saeng with move with it. The paragraph says, �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Spring will come, as nothing can stop time. The snow will melt because the weather changes. The geese will fly home and the hibiscus will bloom in spring. Saeng takes a positive look at things and decides to join them. Sure she failed once but she is strong and willing to try again. If at first you don�t succeed, try, try again. Saeng will always have her memories of home but she is willing to change to her new sorroundings. The concluding paragraph shows Saeng�s determination to succeed and survive in the new world.	2	3		3																					
2779	4	The author concludes the story saying that because she wants to show us that Saeng is confident in herself and will not hesitate to take the test again. She went over to the corner of the vegteble patch and started to dig a hole in the ground.	1	1		1																					
2780	4	The author concludes  with this paragraph, to give a sense at hope and growth. The flower represents Saeng�s  homelard, and it makes her feel comforted. It connects her with her emotions and reminds her of the way are. The growth and flourishing of the hibiscus corresponds to the flourish of Saeng. When it blooms, she will have a true piece of home with her, and  will be able to take the test again. The story  is  about overcoming obstacles and adjusting to change. The visual, and nearly lyrical expression of the blooming hibiscus makes the reward and result of your struggles �seem so much more beautiful	2	3		3																					
2781	4	The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The begining was very negative with Saeng failing her drive�s test and her mother yelling at her. But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will peservere wheras before she was so upset, @CAPS1 when she said, �I-I failed the test.� Then for Saeng to refound from this event, gave the reader hope and thats why the author did this.	2	1		2																					
2782	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author is talking about how there will be a new start. Since Saeng failed the test and in the winter the plant will die in the spring the plant will bud again and she will retake the test. Its a new chance to start things over.	1	1		1																					
2783	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, saeng vowed don't really like to talk. Saeng liked to be by her self sometimes. When spring come it was a different story. Saeng loved the spring and @DATE2. She would play outside all day every day. Saeng was just a nice girl	0	0		0																					
2784	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that character will retry what she failed. In the story the character loves gardening so when her favourite plant comes back she will retry to pass her test.	1	1		1																					
2785	4	The author conclud the story with that because as winter come every thing goes away. Like the trees lose the leaves the geese fly south and the flower die off. So this passage is saying in the spring time when every thing comes back she will start the test again. it is like to start a new life back over.	1	1		1																					
2786	4	"In the story called ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes the story with this paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, than I will take that test again."" The reason why the author had put that at the end of the story was because when things go under ground everyone wants to wait and wait until it comes back up again because when you fail everything goes down but if you wait awhile than everything will start to raise Just like flowers and everything else that you can think of. So that is why the author put that at the end of the story cause to tell people that it is ok for people to fail Just as long as you get up and try again until you reach your goal. So that is what the author was talking about and thats why Minfong Ho put that at the end of the story so that people can read and learn for what it says."	1	2		2																					
2787	4	The author concludes the story with that last paragraph to set the final mood. The author wanted to show that Saeng will not give up and she will continue to adapt to her new surroundings. It made the end of the story feel warm and it also inspired. The end of the story encourages the reader to not give up as well. The last paragraph sets an example of how the reader can vow to improve as well. The author knew that the last paragraph would stand as an inspiration and mabe help a reader going through something similar to the story.	1	1		1																					
2788	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because to her the plant seems to remind her of her homeland which calms her and when it is budding she feels stronger. In the story Saeng is kind of an outsider and when she sees the plant she sees a part of her past back home. In the story it says she gets shaky when she tries to say �at home.� When she says �and this hibiscus is budding,� I think it is really saying when she is ready to accept this country as her home because the flower is a reminder of her homeland. At the end of the story it says how see is getting used to the geese flying in a �V� so she is getting more used to this country and when she is ready she will take her test again.	3	3		3																					
2789	4	"The author includes the paragraph, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" to show that hibiscus is a symbol of time. Saeng uses the hibiscus to measure the amount of time there will be until she takes her test again.  The hibiscus also symbolizes the power to get through struggling (stay strong). Saeng had trouble with her test, but the hibiscus is there to help push her through it to prepare her for the next test. The hibiscus also helps Saeng's mother push through her hard time of seeing her daughter sad from not succeeding on the test. The plant helps the mother try and stay positive and it also helps the mother by trying to do the right thing for her daughter. In the story. the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to make her daughter happy. The hibiscus shows strong symbolism and it helps Saeng and her mother stay strong through out their struggles. "	3	2		3																					
2790	4	This final paragraph goes along with one of the main premises of the story. To not quite and keep going in order to understand and be happy in this world. Saeng is taking this �test� to see if shes ready to change and adapt to her new environment. She failed this time. But when all is right and the hibiscus is ready she will try again to see if shes ready to let go of the old and be happy with the new.	1	1		1																					
2791	4	she said it because she didn�t do what she was sopose to so she said she failed her mother was mad for a second but then stopped she said I love it and asked if she wanted something to eat so the went inside but she took the task as a test so she said next time I will do it right.	1	1		1																					
2792	4	I believe the author ended the story with the �test� because it is a big part of Saeng�s life or part of her tradition.	1	1		1																					
2793	4	There are many reasons why the author concludes the story with that paragraph. First that ending gives a lot of emotion which doesn't cause people to think the story wasn't interesting. Another reason is that it shows strength. Not physical strength, but mental strength. Saeng is stating that even though she failed the test the first time she will take it again. Another reason the author @MONTH1 have used this paragraph to conclude the story is to show people to never quit. It shows how she failed and her mom was disappointed but she is not going to quit and take the drivers test again. Overall the author concludes the story with the paragraph because it gives off a great image to keep trying and never give up.	1	2		2																					
2794	4	The author most likely concludes the story with this sentence because it shows how dedicated the author and her child are to gardening. I am guessing that the young childs favoriteplant is the hibiscus. I think that the mother and her childs favorite thing to do together would be gardening. This is a nice way to end a story. It gives the read kind of a look of question on their faces. It leaves them suspicious of why the author did that. But in my opinion I think it adds some curiosity to the story.	1	1		1																					
2795	4	"The find lines of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" are meant to provide a glimpse into the near future, to show a change in Saeng's attitude. Up until this point Saeng had been lamenting her old country, and not adjusting well to her new one. The Hibiscus inspires her, and lets her know that the new country has many of the same things as her old country. In this last line, she comes to terms with her present situation. ""When the snows melts  and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,"" is a way of saying shes going to let a little time pass, and by taking her driver�s test again, she will begin her new life."	2	2		2																					
2796	4	The author concluded the story with saying that Saeng will retake the driving test in the spring to prove a point. When walking home from her test, Saeng saw a familiar flower and chose to make a delar to a flower shop. There, she saw many flowers that reminded her of home. she bought a hibiscus and went home. Her and her mother planted it, after saeng realized the flower could make it through the winter. She looked up to see many birds flying overhead and she realized that she has adapted to her life in @LOCATION1. The hibiscus has given her the will to survive and she knows she can adapt to life in @LOCATION1. The point the author wanted to get across was that the hibiscus gave courage and hope to retake her drivers test and continue surviving in @LOCATION1.	2	2		2																					
2797	4	The reason I think author concludes this story with this last paragraph is because this is @CAPS1 passion. And that Saeng is very and will do this every year. She really love plants and she will wait to do it again. The last paragraph really showed a lot of dedication. And she really values the spring and the Hibiscus. 	0	0		0																					
2798	4	The author concludes the story with this line to show that just like the hibiscus, adapting and strgging to survive and fit in in it�s non-natve land, Saeng will too. She will not give up her fight to pass the test to become a part of her new country. This is supported through out the story when her mother connents on the hibiscus by the late. She says, �It�s strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matter� (Ho @NUM1). Here the author shows the comparison between the hibiscus' struggle through hard times in a foreign land similarly felt in Saeng�s life. Both must be strong fight through hard imes where no, one, �not even her class mates or frends, or Mrs. Lambert� (Ho @NUM1), understood how alone out of place she felt. So just as she vows to take the test again, shes promising herself she will fight through the hard times grow strong, just as her winter hibiscus.	3	3		3																					
2799	4	Primarily why she said that was she was saying with time come s cause. She was basically saying in a while when things change again she believes that her performance could change as well. I depicted this by the idea you can tell that she is beginning to sit over missing her home in Vietnam and that is memory with time change comes along. That is a simple aspect of logic that with time comes chase. But I think as much I did properly interpret the aspect of what this is supposed to mean overall. But otherwise and finally I believed Saeng said this because time brings change.	2	1		2																					
2800	4	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn�t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn�t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task	1	2		2																					
2801	4	The author concludes the story with this because the hibiscus and Saeng are very similar. Also the narrator compares her to the geese returning. The geese returning represents her starting over at drivers school and doing it again. The hibiscus represents her staying strong in the winter and the come spring she builds up and goes and takes the test again. That is what the narrator choose to end the story that way.	2	2		2																					
2802	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like this for him/her to have a spin off. I mean to me I think that it mean she is going to try again when spring comes so her and her plant can have a fresh start and I think that is a good way to end it.	1	1		1																					
2803	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the hibiscus flower will be adaptating to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has began to grow older and much wiser of things allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now of where she is living just how the hibiscus flower adapts to it's place with ease and gets use to seasons.	2	3		3																					
2804	4	The author @CAPS1 the story with this paragraph because Saeng is saying that When She @CAPS2 @CAPS2 back she will take the test over again wich means that in form of test is that wile she was there it was a test of servle and when the story begains it is a the begaing of the test and at the end of the story the test and there leveing and she wants to come back to see what grew. The author is also saying that you don�t know how good you have it.  	0	0		0																					
2805	4	"Because the Winter hibiscus"" was in the ground how and Saeng tomped down the soil around it. overhead, a flock of canada greese flow by, their faint honks clear and -Yes- @CAPS1 to Saeng now. "	0	0		0																					
2806	4	"The author includes this paragraph in the story because it shows a impression on work ethic and adaption to a new environment can be difficult. �not even @PERSON1, looked it."" makes something to dislike apparent to a student that is new don�t give them good. work ethic and that will essue them mentally also. Therefore the girl is not comfortable and not enthused To  working on something that none woud appreciate."	1	1		1																					
2807	4	The author concludes with this because she is determined to pass the driving test that she had previously failed. For example, She writes �she vowed silently to herself.� When you vow to do something it usually means that you are very determined to do something. Everything else that she says after that she really means it. Therefore, that is why the author concludes with this sentence, in order to show her devotion to her goal.	1	1		1																					
2808	4	The author of the story, Winter Hibiscus, concluded the story with that pharagraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng is finally going to start getting used to her new home. She won�t spend so much time dreaming about her past. �And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� I believe that thats what she needed to get on with her life.	1	1		1																					
2809	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to let us know when she�l take it again. When the season change is when she will take it again. Saeng is probably embrassed that why she wants to wait so long. Saeng took a long walk home and stoped at the flower shop. She tried getting her mind off failing the test. Saeng brought a nice flower/plant for @MONEY1. Her mother was upset at first, then realize her daughter wasn�t happy and changed her mood.	1	1		1																					
2810	4	I belive that the author conclude the story with this because he is saying that she will keep trying and will not give up and will keep on trying. I say this because she just moved to america from Vietnam and is having a hard time adjusting to life in america. I think the geese represent something that is always  changing their surroundings and when they come she is going to fly again to get her licence.  	1	2		2																					
2811	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because now she has something to work for.The author could have also put this concludes the story with this paragraph because she must wait that long till she can take it again also Saeng could want to wait to see the plant grow and get bigger and stronger. They are the reasons why I think the author put that conclude with the paragraph	1	1		1																					
2812	4	Saeng  would  silently in spring she will take the that again in the good ending to this story it was as goods ended  because the story had listed   come  of  malance  ready and spring it and of the plant beautiful  time the spring the all as plant ending because spring in a near trying and for the take the test again of that time , to think it�s a goods ending because the ruler strong are  about   machines saeng and spring it  and  makes  is near paragraph . That is why its is a good ending plant to the stays.   	1	1		1																					
2813	4	The author ends with this because of what the hibiscus means to saeng. To her it is a symbol of strength and comfort. And she knows that if the hibiscus can survive the snow and the cold weather of the winter, she knows that she will not fail either. To her, the hibiscus is a symbol of herself and if it survives, she knows that she too can survive. She is also going to take the test again when the hibiscud are budding since it reminds her of her homeland and comforts her. Then even if she fails she will still be happy since her favorite plant is budding. I also think the author concludes the story this way, because both the plant and Saeng are going to have to overcome obstacles. The plant must survive the winter and come back in the spring. While Saeng must pass her driver�s test. Finally I think the author ended this way because of what the plant means to Saeng. If it survives she knows that she too will survive, and life goes on.	2	2		2																					
2814	4	"I believe the author concluded the story with �When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� because it shows the entire theme of the story. The theme of this story is adjusting to things in life. The conclusion demonstrats this when she says she will take the test again. The hibiscus allowed her to get over the changes in life. For example �The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long grey hair."" The hibiscus was something from home that gave her good memorys. The hibiscus encouraged her to except her new life and keep trying to make it better. "	2	2		2																					
2815	4	The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time that Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, were the winter Hibiscus are popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this maner because it remins Saeng about Vietnam, and how she feels better during that time of year. When she says �And beside it was yet another old friend.� She feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable. This is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did.	1	2		2																					
2816	4	The author concludes the story with this saying because it will be a fresh start and it will be spring and beautiful. �@CAPS1 plant  it right now� is telling me that she wants another try. She wants a fresh strart and come spring when all of her pretty flowers are bloming and geting there chance she wants her now chance to pass best.	0	0		0																					
2817	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of her sadness  for what she did. The test she was telling about was how she was supposed to use the twenty dollars they had and buying one. Big @CAPS1  that she spent most of money besides after to buy a plant which reminded her at home and this last paragraph is saying that when she has the chance to do the �test� again, that she will do what she is supposed to do 	1	1		1																					
2818	4	After reading �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. I believe Ho ended the story with that paragraph to support her idea of overcoming  obstacles. First after failing her driving test, Saeng was very upset and didn�t know if she would ever pass it. But after seeing a hibiscus plant, it reminded her of her home in Vietnam which inspired her. Second, when she bought the plant, her mother was a little angry because it was expensive. But, after seeing how the plant brought joy to Saeng, her mother forgave her. Last when saeng was digging a hole to let the hibiscus grow, it inspired Saeng to take the test again because she overcame the obstacles of brining the plant home and letting it grow. Therefore, I believe Ho end �Winter Hibiscus�, to go along with her idea of overcoming obstacles.	2	2		2																					
2819	4	"The last paragraph of the story displays the theme of determination. The Hibiscus reminded her that her ""home"" was her old life, but misses @CAPS1 in her new life. She gains determination through the reminder of this. She soon realizes that she is home, for things have come familiar to her, such as the V formation of the geese. She loved her old home, but she realized it was time to move on. The last paragraph does not only mean retaking a driving test, it symbolizes the determination to embrace her new home and life.  "	2	3		3																					
2820	4	I will take that test aGain. She has @CAPS1 confidence From The hibiscus and snow. When the snow melts and hibiscus buds. Then she will Go aGain kind oF GrowinG with the hibiscus so an in all she is @CAPS2 to have enouGh conFidence For the test.	1	1		1																					
2821	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because they want people to know what happened in the story. Also because they want people to know what it might mean or say in relation to the story. The sentence means that when spring comes and when the snow might melt the plants will be out and budding but by next class or next school year he will come out and be brave and take the test all over again. That is what the sentence means of the story and how it might be compared to both things in different ways.	1	1		1																					
2822	4	The final  paragraph in, �winter  hibiscus �by @CAPS1  Ho reads  � When  they  come back, Saeng  vowed silently,  to  herself,  in  the  spring,  when  the  snow  melts  and  the  geese  return  and  this  hibiscus  is budding,then I will take that test  again.�This paragraph compares  her to the flowers, which  shows that she is resilient like the flower is strong she is determined to take the test again next year and pass it. She would also take the test because it is comforting to her and reminds her of home	2	2		2																					
2823	4	"He ended the paragraph like that because he @MONTH1 want you to read on, or it could be that he is showing you the comparison between the flower and Saeng. ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when. the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ""The quote is showing the flower can fight through the winter and come back. Saeng failed the test once and is now going back to retake the test. Which shows that they both have modivation and the integrity to come back."	1	2		2																					
2824	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, �When they com back, Saeng vowed silently to hersef, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take that test again�. I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her com fort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", This implies a new beginning so the hibiscus is representing Saeng. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2825	4	The last line is included in the story �Winter Hibiscus� because it showed the connection between Saeng and the flower. Even though Saeng failed the driving test the first time she decides to take it again in the spring. The hibiscus flower like Saeng is out of place and will have to make it through the winter into the spring so it can bud again. This shows how like the flower Saeng will bud again in the spring by retaking the driving test. Another reason is that saeng and the flower are not used to the conditions in @LOCATION1. So they both have to weather the winter months they are not used to. This shows again how the last line connects the girl and the flower together. In conclusion, the last line is used in the text to wrap up the story with a connection between the flower and Saeng.	2	3		3																					
2826	4	I think the author concludes the story with this statement because the author is determined to get used to the new country and surroundings. In the story, the author is showing home sickness. The author see a plant that is know where she come from and buy for over @NUM1 her mother couldn�t believe it. She didn�t want to tell her mother exactly why she got it because she was too shaky to say home or start crying again. The last sentence is showing that author is trying to adapt.	1	1		1																					
2827	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a conclusion that portrays the story. The author talked about the hibiscus in the story as a �comfort in time of distress� a hobby or thing she likes doing with her spear time. In conclusion the author concludes with that paragraph for the reasons stated in the @ORGANIZATION1	0	0		0																					
2828	4	The author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across. It highlights the things important and familiar to saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that she�ll take the test over again once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she sow the plant , �a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng �s eyes now swept over her.� Saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� Saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. Therefore by mentioning   the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure.	3	3		3																					
2829	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it expresses the meaning of the story. Life continues no matter what, the hibiscus will return again in the spring. The hibiscus is like a symbol to Saeng's life. The plant normally doesn't survive in winter months, but this one did. The mother says, ""It's flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the winter months here..."" Saeng and her mother are just like the plant. They are strong and their lives will continue even though they are in a  new environment The author chose to end the story with that parragraph because even  though she say the hibiscus will come back every spring the deeper meaning is that Saeng and her mother, like the hibiscus, will continue to live their lives."	2	2		2																					
2830	4	"The author chooses to end the story in a very deep, connected way. Itis ended On a note of rebirth and second chances. when Saeng vows,� when the come back, inthe spring, when the snow melts and the geese return, when the Hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again,"" The author is connecting a sense oF a new country and second chances and rebirth. Spring and snow melting could be connected to rebirth, while the geese returning could symbolize a second chance. this is connected to saengs second chance.The author also shows that saeng is getting used to the new country, which shows a sense of hope. Itshows that thereis some hope for her test. "	2	2		2																					
2831	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wants us to get the morle of the story. I said this idea because in the story he talks about orchids, lanno bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vires surrounded her. It talks about how these flowers surrounded her to test her. Of her @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
2832	4	I think the Author concludes this in the story because. It is a key information for this story. Because. It is dealing with her mom. She loves to work on the garden and become a garden and have a really job. Like her mom	1	0		1																					
2833	4	Saeng thinks that she has failed because she misses her grandmother. The hiscubus plant that she buys reminds her of grandmother�s scent. Saeng spent over @MONEY1 on the hibiscus plant. She needed it to feel a little bit more at home. Saeng feels she had very little time to leave her country, in �a blink.� Her grandmother would want her to be strong and not cry at the thought of being away from her. Saeng needs to think of the good and smile when she is reminded of her past. Saeng wants to pass the test. next time the hibiscus are budding she must not cry.	1	1		1																					
2834	4	The reason I think that the author did it is because wanted you to know what time it took place and what the weather was like then it also so tells you how long she is going to wait like till the snow melts and that is going to be while and when the geese live and return home so this is why I think she tells you what is like.	0	0		0																					
2835	4	I think that this is about winter hiliscus and hedpe tall and lush bad surrounded their garden its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers, She said when she got to the hibiscus she reached out and touched a petal gently. 	0	0		0																					
2836	4	The reason that the author had ended the story the way she did was to leave the reader on the last thought. Also it symbolizes rebirth. When Saeng says, �... this hibiscus is budding ...� (Ho @NUM1). She is also describing that they will start over when spring comes. And that leaves the reader with the last thought about Saeng, and how she has overcome living in the new place. Lastly, it ties up @CAPS1 feelings and experiences the whole time she had moved, �... I will take the test again� (Ho @NUM1), which tells the reader she will continue to give her new home a shot. In conclusion, the reason for this quote being the last paragraph is to show that Saeng will continue to try to overcome ??? (WORDS NOT @CAPS2) 	2	2		2																					
2837	4	The author concludes story with that paragraph because she wants there to be hope for the future seeing that hibiscus budding in the spring is what Saeng is waiting for. It gives her hope that she will be able to pass that test again. This is showed when she says �.. and this  hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again, ��@CAPS1 the winter ,Saeng hopes she will improve and when the hibiscus  buds she will know that it is time to try again .Saeng sees the spring as a new beginning. So that means it is a time to overcme her obstade.I think that obstade or test might be to not cry when she thinks about her old life in Vietnam. When she accomplishes this, she is growing just like the hibiscus     	2	3		3																					
2838	4	The author concludes the story with that paragrap for one main reason.	0	0		0																					
2839	4	The author is showing that Saeng wants to keep on with her mother's gardening. To take over an elders traditions and what her mother started.	0	0		0																					
2840	4	I believe that the author ended the story with this paragraph to show the persistence of the main character. I believe this because in the beginning of the story when she is walking home, she states that she failed the drivers test. In the last paragraph, she states that after winter is over she will take the test again when her hibiscus blooms. Her persistence allows her to push through life as if she was a plant trying to survive the winter.	2	2		2																					
2841	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because she wants to do it right next time. Whats its saying is that she can try every year to get it right to impress her mother. In conclusion that what I have to say about the paragraph	1	1		1																					
2842	4	 In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author @CAPS1  the most likely ends the story with this quote because he wants to show that she thinks of the Hibiscus as more than just a flowers, to Saeng it is also a memory. For Saeng the Winter Hibiscus is like  story books, waiting to be read simply by smelling the flower it unlocks wonderful memories of precious time spent with her � gentle grandmother� from her first home. @CAPS1  the is trying to use the flower to show the reader how much a simple object can trigger a memory, thought and so on. The last sentence clearly states, with evidence from the story, Saeng cares deeply about her past and so she can fit in with life today she must not forgot who she was. By keeping the hibiscus in her garden she can have a beautiful reminder of whose she  came from. Therefore one is to believe this reasoning is the  assumption as to why @CAPS1 the ended the story �Winter Hibiscus � with the paragraph selected.	3	2		3																					
2843	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. For example, it shows a sense of hope, when she says �this hibiscus is budding"". That indicates a new beginning or starting over. I think that is the idea the author is trying to get across. Obviously it was difficult for the author to adjust to her new country. For example, she was disappointed that the hibiscus wasn�t the same as the one in her homeland. Even though she's feeling hostalgic; this paragraph reassures the reader that the author is willing to give her new country another chance."	2	2		2																					
2844	4	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that �when they come back ... I will take the test again,� (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, �A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept �(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. 	2	2		2																					
2845	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show she loved them flowers. That they met a whole lot to her. When she failed her driven test she was sad. An the flower made her feel better. now that the snow is failing she waits untill spring that when they come up and she will have faith and take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2846	4	The author concluded this sentence because he was letting everyone know that Saeng would return to the hibiscus and take care of it still, and that she has not forgotten about it.	0	0		0																					
2847	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"", by Minfong Ho, a teenager, Saeng, moves from Vietnam to the United states. She later takes a drivers test, but doesn't not succeed in passing, but does succeed in finding comfort from her memories of her homeland. The last paragraph states ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many raesons. These being that Saeng was very upset about failing her test and was reminded of her homeland and the changes she's had to adapt to during this move. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng a hope to continue her jouney even when things get very hard. The winter is this plants time of trouble and sadness, as Saeng's time of trouble and sadness is failing this test and not being at her real home. The end of winter gives both the plant and Saeng a chance to start over and a renewed hope to start over, Saeng will find it easy to get through hardships if she continues to find comfort from her past."	3	3		3																					
2848	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to get the readers wondering. To show that she�s not going to give up on what she wants to do.	1	1		1																					
2849	4	The author Minfong Ho ends the story talking about the test Saeng failed and vowing to take it again because like in the story the test was symbolizing like slightly moving on, just kind of starting her newlife and not living in the old. But Saeng couldnt do that. She bought the flower with all her money because it held memories for her. But I think as the story goes on she kind of realizes she can have both, her old and new life. I think she ends the story that way because she really does want to try again. She wants to be able to please her mom, and herself she wants to be able to move on and starts her new life.	2	1		2																					
2850	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng  relatestnct  she needs more time. If she takes a break and does what she needs to then she @MONTH1 be able to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2851	4	The conclude the story this way because he can now expand on this story creating a sequel about Saeng�s success. Also be ending the story this way the author is showing now a limit Saeng is and now she will stop at nothing until her test is complete. Saeng is having difficulties adapting to her new lifestyle because the plants and the previous luteries that she had are no longer present. In the story Saeng�s determination is shown when her mother finds out that she spent @NUM1 dollers to have a simular plant. The mother responds by saying their whole garden is worth less than @NUM1 dollers.	1	1		1																					
2852	4	This sentence concludes the passage, to show how when the hibiscus is budding and a new season starts, Saeng will be a new person and will be able to take the test. In this sentence the cold snow, fleeing geese and planted hibiscus can all represent Saeng and what she is going through. They are either cold, ready to leave or restricted just like Saeng feels. But, when a new season starts, the geese come back, and the hibiscus is no longer restricted in a pot, Saeng will also grow up and be able to take the test. This sentence is put at the end to show how much Saeng can now grow because she has the hibiscus, which is growing with her.	2	3		3																					
2853	4	The author ends the story with the sentence provided because , she as she was saying that when  you and winter are over there be the time again to get there gardening back to the test with the plant she had planted. 	0	0		0																					
2854	4	The author has concluded the story with a paragraph about Saeng taking the test again another time. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because Saeng wanted to take the test again when the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. She feels ready when that time comes around. Saeng is trying to say to herself that she needs more time to be ready for this test. When she gets more time to be ready for the test, she will take the test again. I think that is why the author wrote the paragraph as a conclusion.	1	1		1																					
2855	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because when the hibiscus started budding it will give her inspiration to try and past the test again. In order to past the test she wanted to feel like she was home, And to have memories of her home to incourage her to try again. Therefore, this is the reason the author concludes the story with the last paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2856	4	The author concludes the story with a paragraph taking the test again to show that the narrator @MONTH1 be upset about being in a new place but she will keep trying. The narrator gets upset when she knows the hibiscus is not like the one's from her old home. This upsets her because she probably misses things that she was used to before. The author uses that paragraph to show the narrator is strong and won�t give up on making things the way they were but also showing that she'll try to adapt to her new home. The author does this to show that you should keep trying at something that you love. The narrator will keep trying when the geese fly back and the hibiscus is budding. So the author is saying try if you fail and set goals to never give up.	2	2		2																					
2857	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.	0	0		0																					
2858	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he knows that he meased up on the test and he saying when spring comes back around he will de ready to take the test I know it is spring because he sad when the snow melts.	1	1		1																					
2859	4	When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus. She felt it could with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased	0	0		0																					
2860	4	In the �passage winter Hibiscus� by monfong Ho, the quote � when they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again, it symbolizes @CAPS1 new journey in the new country she lives in. In the test Saeng is having a personal discrepancy, missing her homeland @CAPS2 she states �I � failed the test.� This test meant more to then she just failing. She was a test to her ability to function in her new country and she failed. The � when they came back�� quote started above can be analyzed deeply as the snow being her obstacles and the hibiscus being herself. When the obstacles melt away and she buds into a new stronger person she will take the test again.	2	3		3																					
2861	4	She will go back to where she started. Its a circle and she will be back the next year where she began.	0	0		0																					
2862	4	NO IMAGE	1	1		1																					
2863	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� ecause that flower budding would make her feel confident about everything. The reason I think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland. It�s basically like she has a little peice of home in her new home. An example that represents this is, �Not like the kind we had before,� this is explaining the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this reminds her of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story the way they do,	2	1		2																					
2864	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to show that Saeng is not just going to give up. She is going to overcome the problem. This is a great way to end this story because the entire story is about overcoming problems and if Saeng just gave up it would ruin the story. But just like she was able to move away from her home land she will eventualy pass the test. The mother was also able to overcome some obstacles. Such as moving away from her homeland and having to plant all new plants. She obviously misss the old plants. You can tell by the way she knew what her gift was. But she is able to deal with that just like Saeng will do on her test the next time.	2	2		2																					
2865	4	Everything in the story is about to change. The winter will change to spring, the snow will melt and vanish, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will also change and mature as well, Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant as the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and she must adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it matured and grew. That is what Saeng must do she must mature and grow in this new country. For example Saeng observed how different the plant looked in the shop window then in did in her home country. She was observing herself and how different she appeared as well. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already and putting it at the end to show that she had grown. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same effect. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change. Saeng is able to do that as well and she made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured just as the things around her have.	3	3		3																					
2866	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph shown for several reasons. First, the author needs to conclude the story without leaving any questions in the readers mind as to what happens. This is achieved by incorperating the geese, hibiscus and her drivers test into the last paragraph. Next, this last paragraph adds a theme of perseverance to the story. The main character is driven to take the drivers test again through memories of Vietnam lastly, it adds to the character by saying that she will ""take that test again"", she is shown as being realistic and not overconsistent. These are some of the ways that the last paragraph enhances the story."	1	1		1																					
2867	4	The author chose to end the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is starting to adjust to her new home and that she will not give up. You can tell that she still misses her homeland by her reaction to seeing the hibiscus plant, but also that she is growing accustomed to her new home because of how she recognizes the geese and will make the decision if when to retake the driving test based on their migration patterns.	2	1		2																					
2868	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng was not prepare for this test, because she was not accustom to the place, but after seeing the plants that reminded her of home, and knowing that the spring time is when more will blossom, she will be ready to take the test over.	1	1		1																					
2869	4	The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to state that the season of the flowers is over and is to be held off until the spring so that give the author a point where he/she can end the story and begin on a new one for when the flowers come back in the spring so inconclusion this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph that they chose.	1	1		1																					
2870	4	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take thattest again"". To show that Saeng is going to take the test again and is not going to give up. This is shown by saying, ""then I will take that test again"". This shows that she has not given up and wants to try again.  "	1	1		1																					
2871	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of how it related to when Saeng failed her driving test. But she was determind to take it over when she feels shes. ready and the paragraph sad ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again."""	1	1		1																					
2872	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� which was wrote by Minfong Ho. I believe she put it there because it keeps you asking questions. I think because her mom was so disappointed with her that maybe she can change things and make things better.	1	1		1																					
2873	4	The author ends the story by saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� she chooses to end like this to show the change of the mood throughout the story. When she gets home her mother �noticed the tear staie on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes.� Saeng felt sad and out of place in the beginning of the story but by the end she felt happy and optimistic. 	2	1		2																					
2874	4	I think the author concludes the story winter hibiscus with this paragraph for these reasons. The first reason is to show that the girl won't give up. She was crying in the store and just very depressed. But, she knows that she has to keep going. It shows a sense of determination. Another reason why I think the author made this the last paragraph is this. It showed her getting used to her environment. I think the author used what she remembers about her country and what she now knows of the new country and puts them together. That way she gets hope from both. For example, in the article it says �many of the things she had thought of as strange before, had become�.. almost familiar to her now. This shows that she is realizing that she is used to the arrangement right now. So she then gets hope from it. Also, I, think the author did that so that it would add a positive effect on the story. That is why I think the author wrote that as the last paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2875	4	The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.	0	0		0																					
2876	4	The author wrotez that last paragraph to give hope to Saeng and the reader. After seeing the hibiscus flower, Saeng is reminded of her old country and feels sad the author write, �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng eyes now swept over her.� Saeng buys the flower and talks with her mum about it at home. The flower reminds her of home but it also gives her inspiration. That is why she says she will pass the test when the Hibiscus buds bloom.	2	2		2																					
2877	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. Durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it it�s winter and the hibiscus hasen�t bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And thats why I think the author ended with that paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2878	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it�s saying that she can�t work in the garden in winter, but �when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding,� are all signs of spring. In the spring, she will take the test again; which implys that she will work in the garden.	0	0		0																					
2879	4	The author concludes the story like this @CAPS2 the Author (Minfong Ho) is telling you what will happen in spring time. I @CAPS1 this @CAPS2 the text say's Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that the test again. This means that in spring the hibiscus will @CAPS3.	0	0		0																					
2880	4	because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place	1	1		1																					
2881	4	The author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph becauses it symbolizes Saeng�s decision to try again. Things in nature are repeatative, seasons change but eventually they appear again, geese migrate but they too return and the author used this as a comparsion to Saeng�s decision to try for her license again. Just like Saeng the winter hibiscus was out of. As normal environment but was learning to adapt and that inspired Saeng to keep an trying even if she failed because the hibiscus was trying to survive the winter even though it was out of place.	2	2		2																					
2882	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because know matter what she said or did she had to git the flower because it remids her of where she used to live and how It was there so she stared to cry and the test was not to buy the flower and not to cry and that in th spring she is going to grow her own flower. That is what I think the test is about.	1	1		1																					
2883	4	She see if her plant will survive then the winter just like the ones back at home.. And she things will be the. Same.	1	1		1																					
2884	4	Its the start of a new life. She has a new new school and a new plant, Its is like she has a connection to the plant, when it grow she grows stronger and more confident. That�s when she said when they come back when the hibiscus is budding she will be ready for that test.	1	1		1																					
2885	4	The author ends it with that because it shows that she won�t give up and that she will give her new country a chance. She ends it with that to say that she will be strong like the flower and that she will stay no matter what! That she will be there, in that spot to see it grow back. That's why I think she concluded with that.	1	1		1																					
2886	4	Throughout this story we are given background information on a girl who deferately misses her true home when we are first introduced to young saeng she is in a flourist�s shop simply looking at flowers, we soon learn that she is not only  looking at flowers but looking a pieces of her home and past, she then purchases a hibiscus which is a flower native to her vietnam. After discovering that she has just failed a test it becomes more apparent that buying the flower is a way to cope with her new situation in @LOCATION1 and feel comforted by her past. The author is able to conclude the story with that satement because it speaks of moving forward without clinging to the past, In the spring saeng  will have a new home and find strength in her past, that is what I feel the final paragraph suggests	3	2		3																					
2887	4	The author concludes the story with this  paragraph  because,Saeng  is determined  to  pass the test. She knows when its spring and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test I think she wants to retake the test because  the  hibiscus makes her think about her homeland. It makes her feel more confident. She thinks she can pass it next time. The hibiscus  makes  her  happy and overwhelmed. She wants to retake the test. She�s sure she will do better next time.	1	2		2																					
2888	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. It�s just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. That�s the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.  	2	2		2																					
2889	4	"Guess that she is saying that when winter is gone she will prepared for that winter test again. I guess this because they were not prepared for the winter to come as they were planting. As in the reading she says, ""As if oblivious to the cold, he mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. Thats the reason why I believed that they were not prepared for the winter."	1	1		1																					
2890	4	The author concluded the story in this manner so that the audience would feel sympathy and understanding for the things that Saeng and her family were going through in this hard time. It makes the reader feel sympathy for Saeng because all she can think of to make herself feel better is her home town and how she got taken away.	1	1		1																					
2891	4	He concludes the story because he was another chance to etact the test.	0	0		0																					
2892	4	"The author concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to emphasize a new life and new chances for the main character. The future setting of the paragraph, spring, symbolizes rebirth & another start from the cold, hard winter. The author takes this to heart including, more events which enhance this symbolized meaning. the author has uses structured choice to carry her toughts. Recreate, when to convey the theme of rebirth, the author uses words like ""the gesse return"" and ""take the test again"" which add to the importance at the home. Also, the literal action of the ""hibiscus is budding"" @CAPS1 rebirth. In winter the plant is dormant & less colorful, but in the spring the plant shows rebirth through about color in its buds. The author finally conveys the theme of rebirth by ending with this paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2893	4	In the story �winter hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, it tells of a girl who just moved to a new country & is having a hard time adapting to the new land & its people. But I think the author put that quote at the end to lead you to believe to never give up, there is a new beginning & you will make it. I believe this because Saeng thinks to herself, �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she thought of strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her.� This shows that has finally has found comfort & is confident, like the geese going to adapt in a new area, & then will come back, & that the winter hibiscus new gives up & will keep living in the new weather conditions every season.	3	2		3																					
2894	4	She concludes the things at the end of her paragraph she says a whole thing it means she will look at it when the winter is done. She will be able to retake the test again in the spring. That is what she was writing about	1	1		1																					
2895	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she is trying to adapt to her new sorrounds. The hibiscus reminds her of her old life and it comforts her. So when she takes her test in the spring she will feel better and more comfortable while she is remembering her old life in a new place. In the story it says that she failed her test and then she bought a plant that reminded her of her old life. The plant brought back memories of her old life and that helped comfort her. The spring reminds her of her old life because the flowers in the garden are blooming, the geese return, and the snow has melted. Saeng feels like she could adapt to her new surroundings with the comfort of her memories of her old life.	2	1		2																					
2896	4	"The author chose this paragraph because it fit right like a good conclusion showed for example the word again it means that you did something already and it's over but you miss so you retry what you miss, but in the paragraph it's talking about the nature and how they want to test it!(""again"")!."	0	0		0																					
2897	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.	1	1		1																					
2898	4	"In the short story ""Winter Hibiscus,"" a young girl from vietnam moves to @LOCATION1 and fails the drivers test. After she decides to spend money on a winter hibiscus to remind her of her homeland, The ending paragraph, ""who troy come back, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. shows deep feeling towards nature. She feels as when the Geese we ready to return home and when the hibiscus is ready to bud so will she and she will take to drivers test again."	1	2		2																					
2899	4	She is talking about the flowers and win she says test I think she means how she looks  and exameans the flowers and see the snow fall all over again. It sounds like the author is some one how admayers flowers a lot or maybe just this one hibiscus and how it buddies. Maybe she is just some one how likes to see changes.	1	1		1																					
2900	4	I believe the author adds this passage to the Story to represent determination and @LOCATION1. While Saeng is not originally from @LOCATION2 she is determined and willing to try and. adapt to our @CAPS1. While the winter was cold and harsh in many ways for her, the Spring will Bring foregiveness and relief from her @CAPS2. She will try to pass the driving test again to further herself into american @CAPS1, while the blooming of the Hibiscus will bring her @CAPS4 to home.	2	2		2																					
2901	4	"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"". The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese & the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one."	2	3		3																					
2902	4	She wanted to learn, and do more things. She loved the way the plants looked at the store. Her mother got the plant, went home, and they started planting it. The daughter loved the plant very much. And she said that next year I�ll grew a plant as wonderful as the oh her mom was growing.	0	0		0																					
2903	4	I think the author concludes this paragraph in this story to describe how grown up Saeng is now since it doesn�t look like she leaves with her mom anymore. To the author probably wants to emphasize the reader @CAPS1 of Saeng, now on for she probably leave since she doesn't leave with her mom anymore. In what happen was just her past and will be memorable to Saeng.	0	0		0																					
2904	4	"The author uses that passage to end the story to show that Saeng will try to adopt. When Saeng smells the Hibiscus �The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng [she] could almost feel. The light sounds of her grandmother�s long gray hair"" This @CAPS1 that Saeng was looking for things that were familiar to her and reminded her of her homeland. The fact that Saeng paid over nineteen dollars for a plant also @CAPS1 how much she missed her homeland. ""d-d failed the test that Saeng paid.� @CAPS1 the reader that she attempted to adapt to her new home but failed. This makes her sad and causes her to miss the way things used to be. at the end of the story she said that ""I [she] will late the test again."" seeing the familiar hibiscus and geese leaver knowing that they will return gives Saeng hope. the last time in the story @CAPS1 the regard they @CAPS2 will always remember her homeland  "	3	2		3																					
2905	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng isn't going to give up.	1	1		1																					
2906	4	With the hibiscus around Saeng she will have more courage and also have had more time to adapt in their new home. For Saeng the hibiscus is like motivation and it also reminds her. Of her old homeland. The reason I think the author choose to end the story with the paticular comment is to show that Saeng had in the end found courage and is ready to accept her tasks in this foreign land.  	0	0		0																					
2907	4	The story concludes that paragraph because its tell you that there changes in the weather and season as much as there is in your life. That you have to sometime deal with changes in your life. The test might be one to see if she can understand her self. There changes in the weather all the time there changes in the spring fall she other that you just got to get over.	1	1		1																					
2908	4	In the story the �winter Hibiscus� by minfong Ho the writers ends with a paragraph that concludes the story. One of the reasons she concluded with the last paragraph the @CAPS1 she did is because it tells the reader that Saeng  @CAPS1 not given up on her drivers test. �� Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� This explains in more details when  she will take the test Again another years on is because it leaves the reader to think how the rest of the story will go.	1	2		2																					
2909	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, was a great way to end it becase I think that she sees how much the hibiscus can take then she can take just about anything mainly the test. Also when her mother said �You what?� �Her mother stared at her incredulously�. Sh might have also understood that if her mum could get over being mad then she would over come being upset about the test.	2	2		2																					
2910	4	The writes this this conclusion to the end of the story because he wants people to know that the season's are changing and the flowers are going to be dying. He also wants you you to know that when the season changes back the flower will try and fit again with the other flowers. that�s what the author means when he talks about taking the test again.	0	0		0																					
2911	4	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says �when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.� The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on.	2	2		2																					
2912	4	the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first their is always a second time just like the @CAPS1 I dies in the winter and it come back alive in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2913	4	The author leaves us at the end of the story saying �when the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author is said that because the girl Saeng failed the test but still found something that remined her of her home. She was happy, but the plant were not exactly like the one from home. But she got used to it. The flower @MONTH1 not be the same but it�s an @CAPS1 flower and she is getting used to beining in @LOCATION1. When she goes back to take the test she will be ready and so will her plant. Her plant will full of life.	1	1		1																					
2914	4	I think the author ends the story like this becuose of Saeng's respect for the plant. Not only does she see the plant as a simple of her home but also as a symble of good luck. In the text she holds the plant in a very high value, having payed @NUM1 coins for it, So I think it ends like this to symbolize that Saeng believes that the best time to take the test is when the hibiscus is growing.	1	1		1																					
2915	4	The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to @LOCATION1, the geese show her that she is, even now adapting to her new homeland when she geese seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was pretty but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she came to @LOCATION1, is adopted to the mre resilient and withstand the snow which symbolizes her problems adapting to @LOCATION1. For saeng, the hibiscus budding again represents her becoming stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to go take the test again when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to connect the Hibiscus budding with Saeng overcoming her obstacles. 	3	3		3																					
2916	4	The author chose to conclude the story like that because she’s saying that it isn’t over and she’s going to take the test again. In the story Saeng says “I- I failed the test” so shes determined to go back when the flower blooms again to get things right.	1	1		1																					
2917	4	I think what the author is trying to say is that she will take her driving test again in the spring when the flowers are out because it will make her feel more relaxed. The flowers put the author in a relaxed state of mind where she can focus.	1	1		1																					
2918	4	Because she saying when the @CAPS1 grow back she will be @CAPS2 to take the test again.	3	3		3																					
2919	4	In the story �winter hibiscus� by minfong Ho, the author is concluding the story with this last sentence because its showing everyone that the seasons over for the growing of the plants but when it comes time for the flowers to start growing again she will be back to take care of the plants because its her favorite & they are what she lives for now that she has to take care of them. Also the author probably put the conclusion of the story like that to get people interested in reading more of the story later on because your getting left in a sense of suspense, because you don�t know if she really will go back to the plants or just about them. another reason I think, the auther ended it that is because its still snowing she cares about the plans but she isn�t gonna worry about them until it is the right time again. For example she says �when they come back then I will take the test again,� that�s showing she isn�t giving up on anythin she loves and she will keep trying until she gets it.	1	1		1																					
2920	4	"In the story �the Winter Hibiscus"", I think the author uses the last paragraph to show that although the memories  of  her old country would always be with her but she soon will adapt to her new one. Also from time to time she still will visit her old country. For example �when the show melts and the geese return"", The last sentences, then I will take the test again�, This sentence means that once she is adapted to this country on goes back to her old one she still will enjoy their either way."	1	1		1																					
2921	4	The author conclude the story with this paragraph to show that saeng is going to retake the test over when all these things happen. Saeng shows that she is not going to give up, and that she is going to keep trying. The hibiscus is a lucky charm to her to keep during the test to strive her to pass the test. In addition, the author also conclude the story with this paragraph to show saeng personal thoughts, and how she feels about this test. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, is a indication that it time to give the test another try. In conclusion, the paragraph is a indication that saeng is never going to forget.	2	1		2																					
2922	4	The author concludes the story with  the last paragraph of the story. When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibisous is budding, their i will take that test again.	0	0		0																					
2923	4	I guess she felt that it was a good way to unit all up	0	0		0																					
2924	4	In �Winter Hibiscus�, the author concludes with Saeng saying �I will take that test, again, it means that Saeng will be ready as soon as the spring arrives and her hibiscus is all in bloom. When Saeng bought the hibiscus, she was sure that as soon as the winter passes with the coming of spring, she is sure that taking the drivers test, again will be easier to overcome the fear and grieving times in a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. This means that Saeng is able to overcome her fear of a new place. Saeng is also sure that the memories of her homeland will help her, too. In the end, its revealed that Saeng has become strong and has high hopes to see her success be fulfilled in her new homeland.	2	1		2																					
2925	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows he determination. In the spring it will be hard for the hibiscus to survive because its a winter hibiscus and it also has determination.	1	1		1																					
2926	4	I believe the author used that statement to end the story because by the end Saeng was ready to face her obstacles again, also it shows that she was apprechiating  her new environment. The plant that Saeng purchased her mother stated that, �it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here� @CAPS1 it�s telling Saeng if the plant can make it through the harsh conditions then just maybe you can make it through living in a new country. When Saeng relized that things had a repeation season upon season she must had reliced that she can do it too, and face the driving test again.	2	2		2																					
2927	4	The author includes this last paragraph in the story, �Winter Hibiscus� to show that the main character still has hopes and has not given up on her new lifestyle. During the story, the main character Saeng reminisces on her not so distant past memories of her native home in Vietnam when she recognizes a certain plant from her country. This is important in the story because Saeng is still unhappy about moving to @LOCATION2 and she begins to cry as she walks home, having bought the plant, to her mother. �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.� Saeng�s mother understood how she was feeling, and she was not dissapointed in her for failing her driving test either. Her mother made Saeng feel better by planting the familiar Hibiscus into the garden right away. The last paragraph of the story gives hope to the reader that Saeng will not give up her strength to live a different life in @LOCATION2 that she is not used to. �When the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� It is as if Saeng is vowing that in time, she will be happy with her new life, not just passing a driving test. The Winter Hibiscus stands as a symbol for Saeng to be strong in the new country while still remembering her old life in Vietnam.    	3	3		3																					
2928	4	"The author MiNfoNg Ho coNcluded the story with ""wheN they coMe back, SaeNg vowed sileNtly to herself, iN the SpriNg, wheN the snow melts and the geese returN and this hibiscus is buddiNg, theN I will take the test agaiN because wheN the plaNt begiNs to blossom she @MONTH1 feel more confideNt and comfortable. At time you caN see how she's triNg to adapt to new surroundiNgs. I believe that the hibiscus represeNts comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt and, a connectioN to her past expeirences. SiNce the hibiscus represeNts a comfort at times of disappoiNtmeNt, is the reasoN she weNt out and purchased the plaNt.

2929	4	The past experiences of our lives often  influence things in our life, weather we consciously know it or not. In this story Saeng  tries to go to the flower shop and pass the test of not buying the cestain  flower that reminels her of her home, when she fails. She is trying to get over the fact that she is not �at home,� that things and people that use to be ground no longer are. But there are new things that she is becoming used to. I think that the author ends the story with the paragraph that he did, to show that you can alway�s  change. She is trying to put things that make her used further  back in her mind, and with time, she can do that maybe even by next year, because it is always possible to do something if you really wants to do it, and the author is showing that Saeng  really wants to pass her own mind test, so she can further adapt to change, her mother will be proud of her.	3	2		3																					
2930	4	I think that she was that way to say, hey I didn�t over come something and I�ll be back next year to take the test again like the hibiscus budding when she snow melts and the geese return @CAPS1 year.	1	1		1																					
2931	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted the readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test over again.	1	1		1																					
2932	4	When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year. She means trying to plant the plants all over again. When Saeng says �Here, let me help, mother. Right then you know that Saeng does want to help with the plants after all.	0	0		0																					
2933	4	The authors choice of the last paragraph in the short story, �Winter Hibiscus shows the hope for the future that seang feels. The winter and cold represent how she feels out of place and upset at not receiving her driver�s license. In the spring she will have a piece of her homeland blooming and she will be warm again. She will feel ready to take her test again �when they came back. This shows adapting to and accepting her new life away from her home and her memories. The last paragraph proves that she was strong enough to move past her hardships and move on	2	2		2																					
2934	4	The speaker @MONTH1 conclude the story with that paragraph because the geese returning and the hibiscus budding @MONTH1 help her with her confidence. She wants to feel like she can do this test.	1	1		1																					
2935	4	"The author conclude the story with the paragraph ""when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese returned this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She realize she has another chance to pass the test, when the spring blossoms again she begin to garden when the spring returns."	1	1		1																					
2936	4	"Saeng finds comfort in memories of her homeland. When she took that test, everything was unfamiliar to her, so she failed, but on her way back something familiar found her. Native plants of her home. �There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single bloodred blossom, "" "" "" �floating in the bucket.� Saeng needs familiar things to comfort herself. So when she sees the geese, and this symbolizes change. �Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched.� Spring is a time for new beginnings, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.� When the familiar object is at it's best, she will be her best and be able to face anything. Winter is the �getting-ready� stage."	2	2		2																					
2937	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended the story with the paragraph, �when they came back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snowsmelt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She did this because she bought the flower when she failed the test so when the flower blooms she will take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2938	4	I�ll think the author tried two say wean it coming two snow melt like @MONTH1 they she will be come back. Author will because in the spring sometime to written a new book.	0	0		0																					
2939	4	The author of�Winter Hibiscus �uses this paragraph to conclude her story because it is a symbol of saeng�s future .Winter Hibiscus is a symbol of saeng for many reasons.  For one, both saeng and the plant are from Vietnam and both struggle to survive and thrive in the new world of the @ORGANIZATION1.  Saeng promises herself that when the plant thrives in the spring, so shall she by retaking her driver�s test.  This symbol of future is extremely important to the story live and this is why ming fon Ho, the author of Winter Hibiscus, chose to end with this vital symbol.   	2	2		2																					
2940	4	The author of ,�Winter Hibiscus ,� concludes the story with the paragraph,� When they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again .�The author most likely chose this as the last paragraph to help the reader  understand  the message. The message of this story is no matter what happens or what challenges you face, never give up and always keep trying. The author makes that the last paragraph to make the reader think and ponder upon what it means.	1	1		1																					
2941	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph for one reason. That reason is because Saeng thinks she failed because she got a fake plant instead of a real one. She felt disappointed when she brought it home.  For example, she said �I failed,� talking about the plant. She also compares where she is now to where she used to live. For example, she said �its not like the one at home.� That�s why the author concludes this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2942	4	�When they comeback, Saeng vowed to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 of all this statement with the story because she likes being in the garden and your not aloud to be in the garden when it snows. Second of all she loves plants and things similar to plants etc that�s why the author concluded the paragraph to the story due to the fact that when it hits spring Saeng is going to purchase plants and flowers. Last of all Saeng she sees a familiar plant, later she goes to a flowrist shop to see if it can be purchased and Saeng gets highly upset when something goes wrong with them.	0	0		0																					
2943	4	In the text, when the mother said �It�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matter� This sentences shows that Saeng is just like the flowers. They�re strong to live through the winter, that shows they are very pretty and strong in the spring. This amphasis that Saeng will be strong and more confident in the spring. That�s why the author put it in at the end. It�s also reflected to the flower, how they�re pretty and strong in spring	2	1		2																					
2944	4	In the short story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the author includes a paragraph at the end, stating that the main character, Saeng, will take her driving test again. Ho, includes this paragraph to show that Saeng is determined to adapt. Saeng is new to the United States, her and her mother had moved here from Vietnam. Throughout the story she is reminising about her home life in Vietnam. About her grandmother, and the flowers there. �Where was me...hibiscus hedge?.. Her gentle grandmother?� When at the flower shop, Saeng finds an hibiscus, flower they also had in Vietnam. She sees how it has adapted to survive in the winter here. As she is planting the flower in her backyard, she makes a promise to herself to pass the driving test next spring. She too, wants to become adapted to the @LOCATION3 and beable to live here without missing home too much. This vow she made is included in the last paragraph. The author included it to show Saeng too, wants to adapt to her surrounding and pass the driving test,	0	0		0																					
2945	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the true meaning of the hibiscus. The hibiscus is symbolic to Saeng in several ways, but the most important is that it represents change and growth and the ability to overcome obstacles. Upon seeing it, she is overcome with childhood memories and sentimentality. However, she must adjust to her new home if she wants to grow as a person. She will survive here, just as the hibiscus will survive through the winter. Also, Saeng vows that �in the spring� when �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is determined to succeed, and the hibiscus itself represents triumph over obstacles.  It stands for survival and endurance through life�s disappointments and challenges, from failing a driver�s test to starting a new life in a strange and foreign country. The author�s choice to end the story with this paragraph exhibits Saeng�s ultimate understanding of her strength through the symbol of the hibiscus.	3	3		3																					
2946	4	I believe that the author concludes the paragraph like that because he/she wanted to show an important message to the audience. The message that the author was trying to get across was that even though she didn�t pass the test she was going to try to Next .year. Ane example of this is an exact quote �in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again�. This is why I think the author concludes the story like that.	1	1		1																					
2947	4	The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her drivers test for the first time when the hibiscus starts to bud it will represent a change in her life. Also, Saeng use to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam so when the flower buds it could show that she has a new home. 	1	1		1																					
2948	4	The author finished the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason for conclusion is that it is important for Saeng  to feel at home. When the hibiscus buds it wiil remind her of home and this will comfort her, when she feels at peace and at home she will do better on the test.	1	1		1																					
2949	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one. She shows she isn�t giving up when she brings home the flower to plant. That also shows she will not forget her old home. Also when she says, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� That shows she is giving her new home another shot and isn�t giving up. Another example is when it says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance. She is not giving up on it.	2	2		2																					
2950	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph. She does because she is ready to do the same thing next year. She like spending time with her mom, she likes plants, she likes having fun with her mom. This are some reasons why she concludes with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2951	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the hibiscus provides comfort. @CAPS2 Saeng failed her driving test and was new to @LOCATION1, she was frustrated and was missing her real home in Vietnam. The hibiscus reminded her of her grandmother. She writes �she closed her eyes and breathed in deeply as the fragrance filled her lungs� after Saeng smelled the flower it reminded her of �combing her grandmother�s long grey hair, freshly washed� it brought her comfort in a time of disappointment. @CAPS2 she didn�t have her grandmother, the flower comforted her. Although she was disappointed the hibiscus was �exquisite� and as she said the @CAPS1 word �dokor malik� meaning hibiscus she �savored the feel of the word on her tongue.� @CAPS2 the joy and comfort is what the flower brings to Saeng, she will take the test again in the spring when �the snow melts and the hibiscus is budding, thus bringing joy, love, and comfort to the reader as they feel what Saeng feels.	3	2		3																					
2952	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because it relates the idea of the hibiscus to Saeng and her situation in a new country. It shows that Saeng is using the hibiscus and its ability to adapt for inspiration. During the story, Saeng describes how she had always seen the hibiscus at home in her old country. Her mom describes to her that the hibiscus she bought is a bit different from the one back home. But she says it�s because it�s strong and was able to adapt to the cold winter environment of the United States. This is what Saeng was able to use as inspiration. She might have failed her lisence test, but she used the hibiscus actions to set a goal for herself. The plant will go through a cold, and snowy winter but it will grow and blossom in the spring. Saeng would use that time to study and get ready, and she�ll be confident for the test. The paragraph that the author finishes on shows the connection Saeng made with her situation and the plant�s situation.	2	3		3																					
2953	4	�If at first you don�t succeed, try, try again.� This quote is used by many parents trying to encourage their children or by coaches to motivate their time. The quote can also apply to Saeng�s situation in the short story, �Winter Hibiscus.� Saeng fails her drivers test and, when walking home after the test, notices a hibiscus flower which reminds her of her homeland. Sadness encompasses her and she purchases the plant to pocify her grief. She brings it home and is at first reprimanded by her mother but then thanked for buying. While Saeng is planting the hibiscus, she hears the honk of Canada geese which had become familiar to her by then. The text says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, become familiar to her.� This quote shows the adaptation she had to face in coming to @LOCATION1. The author concludes the story with the paragraph to show that like the hibiscus flower, she will adapt to the terrain and toils of @LOCATION1. The hibiscus inspires her to push forward and try again for license as the plant pushed forward through winter.	3	3		3																					
2954	4	The author ends the story this way because Saeng feels a sence of comfort with the hibiscus flower. The flower reminds her of her homeland with her grandmother. According to the story �the familiar frogrence filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmothers long gray hair.� you can also tell she misses her homeland but always keeps it close to her heart whereever she goes. The text states that, �it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.� She seems to be very close with nature and all of its desirable traits. When she failed the test she bought her �@CAPS1 Malik� flower, as a sence of comfort. They both decided to plant it in their garden and while doing so, Saeng received a huge boost of confidence to retake the test.  	2	2		2																					
2955	4	She compares the paragraph to the story to compare it to school. The test is makeing new friends and doing good on the test and classes. In the paragraph it said �Then I will take that test again.� That is the reason she is comparing that paragraph to school.  	0	0		0																					
2956	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the Saeng's determination to over come the obstacles of her past experience. For example, the story starts out with Saeng taking a �test�,  while reliving her memories in the greenhouse, she started to breakdown. �A wave of loss so deep and story it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" She then buys the plant and takes it home to her mother,telling her that she 'failed'. The mother then becomes understanding and helps Saeng's vow retake the 'test', the narrator emphasizes Saeng�s determination to overcome the troubles of her past and go on with the future."	2	2		2																					
2957	4	Because her school work was the whole reason as to why she was studying flowers in a green garden. And it is obvious she failed the test so when spring starts to show she will retake the test because the flowers will bloom and she can do more study to pass the test and not have to take it again. I get the feeling though she is also looking forward to the spring time coming back now an day so she can enjoy the flowers and the presents of growing and studying.	1	1		1																					
2958	4	"I think that the author concluded the story with that particular paragraph because she wanted us to see that Saeng was not giving up Saeng was originally from Vietnam but she moved to the United States. She missed being home so much because nothing was the same. �It�s not a real one,� Saeng mumbled. �I mean, not like the kind we had at-at'. She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home. �But once Saeng finally realized that she was beginning to adapt to the life in the United States, she decided that she was going to give the drive�s test one more try. �When they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."""	2	2		2																					
2959	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she seems to led comfortable when she saw the geese and plants the hibiscus in the winter and keeps it from dying. In the story it said,""... their faint banks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now"". I think this is explaining how she feels after seeing the geese fly over head because she uses to see that in Vietnam. Also, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�, she gains more confidence because she leds like she�s back in Vietnam. All in all, that's why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2960	4	I think the reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to allow the reader to imagen what happens next once spring rolls around for Saeng. This allows the reader to use their imagenation to connect to the story. Another reason why the author chose to conclude the story like that with that paragraph was to give hope to the reader that maybe she will pass the test next time. It was also a way to end the story in a good note.	2	1		2																					
2961	4	The auther ended the story with that preticular paragraph because like the geese she will be back to try again. Just in case she didn�t get to finish JUST about everything she wanted to do and that the auther wanted the reader to know the determination and ambition of the character in the story. Also to show the readers that the characters characteristics couldn�t be beat by one winter and that she is going to keep going at it untill she does what she has to do.	1	1		1																					
2962	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� most likely concludes it with the paragraph of Saeng vowing to retake the test to show that even in difficult times and new situations a person can never give up and sink into despair and that there always things to comfort someone.In the story, glimpses of @CAPS1 home are given in her memories and from them, the reader can understand what a difficult day Saeng is having. The author is describing these warm, comforting memories to help clash with the cold, bitter day the girl is having. �She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs.� Here, saeng recalls a memory of her grandmother and it saddens her at the thought of her home and her loss. The author builds up Saeng�s despair and upset for the final paragraph. The author has this as the final paragraph because it shows hope. As Saeng says, �then I will take that test again.�you can feel her hope. Also, the author want`s to express how there is still structure and stability in a changing world and that you can look to the simple things. Saeng says,�the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,� and this shows how there are some reliable things that can give you security when you think you have none. The author uses this last paragraph to balance the feeling of despair in the story, to emphasize the need for hope and to show that there always things that can give you hope and security.	3	3		3																					
2963	4	The author concludes the story of the paragraph because, the author would like to finish the last sentence of the story. Also at the last of the paragraph is when she is visualizing and putting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are appreciated to the plant. The author wanted more evidence to the story. For example, when it said, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese ruturn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It includes the winter time for the plant. Also, the @DATE2 and spring the plant comes back, which the character saeng will get it back, and visit it.	1	0		1																					
2964	4	The auther mad it seem like he did not like it but he loved flowers and he like working in the syr wit the people his mom is anierpaady he liked to see him togod wit his life that come back becus thay liked the place.	1	1		1																					
2965	4	"The auther includes this at the end to show how much she cares about the plant and that she seils brought back her back to her childhood. An example of her loving the plant is that rich scent"" (Paragraph Minfong Ho), @CAPS1 examples �It felt smooth and cool� (paragraph Minfong Ho) An example of to childhood's plan is that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten. she come back we could reed (paragraphs Minfong Ho) For these ways think that is why the author adds that at the end."	1	1		1																					
2966	4	I believe that the author left this as the last thing the reader will read, so it will be a message. In the story this girl has now moved to this totally new environment and new culture. The only thing she knew of was a flower that grew wild where she lived. This little vow to herself was a message to not give up. Keep on going and if you open your mind to new things who knows what you can experience and learn. So this girl didnt just give up. Her plant was like a representation of a new beginning. When her plant starts over then so will I. Also it can be a representation of her life itself. I say a new begging because in the text, it says,	2	2		2																					
2967	4	I think the author wrote that because maybe that how she fells like in the winter she could really show people who she is but when spring come out she like a flower that has been dead all winter  	0	0		0																					
2968	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph before they were talking about the �winter hibiscus� and the geese. So the author just simply writes another concluding paragraph that just wraps the story up, and the reader walkes away with a feel good feeling.	1	1		1																					
2969	4	In the story the Winter Hibiscus by Minfong Ho it explains the obstacles Saeng went through coming to a different country. In this story Saeng had just failed her driving test as she was reminded of her home through some tropical flowers. Moreover the author writes at the end of the story referring to geese �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, it the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again.� This part of the story is very important because it examines her growth and hope for change, just us the geese will come back and the hibiscus will change into a buetiful blossed flower. Furthermore it explains to the each that she will not give up and that she will change to the environment just as th plant lives has and the geese come back to the changed environment. That part of the story is very important for the reader, @CAPS1 it concludes Saeng thoughts and hopes for the future wile adapting to her new enviorment.     	3	3		3																					
2970	4	The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there waste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there watste.

2971	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng said she failed the test, and when spring comes back then she will take the test again. The last paragraph reads �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� She really does not tell us what test she is supposed to be taking.	1	1		1																					
2972	4	The reason why the said she will wait til spring to take the test again, is to see if she�s still like the bitter melon over the Big-mac.	0	0		0																					
2973	4	The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story.	1	1		1																					
2974	4	I think that the reason the author concludes the story like that, is that it awhave ending. also so you know that the story is that they could make more.	1	1		1																					
2975	4	What the author concludes that in the spring time when the snows melts and the flower comes back it makes be risk of spring time at home. Which makes her relax. Also spring time is a more pretty time because all the flowers are out and the flower that reminds her at home blessings.	1	1		1																					
2976	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again. Saeng is going to wait to take the test whe n she knows that she will past the test so she can get her licesned. Saeng wants her licesned so she can drive anywhere she wants to go. So she don't have to get her mom to take her everywhere she wants to go she can take her ownself anywhere she wants. But she has to wait till the snows is melted before she takes her test again.	1	1		1																					
2977	4	The paragraph shows that Saeng has a lot of feelings for her plants. She enjoys plants and she loves taking the time to spend with the plants. She means in that last paragraph that she cant wait for winter to leave so her plants will be budding and that she can enjoy her plants.	0	0		0																					
2978	4	"The author concludes the story with this parapraph because it ties it all together. I think that the author uses. it also to say that in the spring she will pass the test. I really like the part when she says ""�in the spring, when the snows melt�."" I like that because it explains what she wants and how she puts her mind to it."	1	1		1																					
2979	4	The author most likely uses this paragraph to show her setting a goal for the cycle to start over. She uses geese as a symbol for spring, when she would start preparing for this �test� once again. The hibiscus budding in this paragraph shows hope, because it is once again, a start of a cycle as well as an object of reminiscence in the story. In conclusion, this concluding paragraph uses several symbols and devices in order to convey hope, good memories, and fresh start.	2	2		2																					
2980	4	The would grow some flowers and water the geese come back to her pond.	0	0		0																					
2981	4	THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES THE STORY WITH THAT PARAGRAPH FOR MANY REASONS. ONE REASON BEING THAT THE AUTHOR WANTED TO REALLY SHOW THE MEANING OF THE FLOWER. ANOTHER REASON IS TO EXPRESS THE THEME. FOR EXAMPLE AT THE END OF THAT PARAGRAPH IT SAYS �THEN I WILL TAKE THAT TEST AGAIN.�, ITS RELATING THAT SMALL TOPIC OF THE DRIVING TEST TO THE LARGER TOPIC OF THE FLOWER. WHICH THEN RELATES IT TO THE THEME OF ADJUSTING AND KEEP TRYING TILL YOU ADJUST. THAT LAST PARAGRAPH WAS QUITE VITAL TO THE THEME AND MEANING OF THE STORY.	2	1		2																					
2982	4	I believe the author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus�, written by Minfong Ho, with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, because she is trying to show how past memories can be transformed into hope and determination. After failing her driving test Saeng finds the Hibiscus, the memories of her home land and her grandmother consume her. She buys the plant and puts it in the vegetable garden. After she is done planting, Saeng sees a flock of Canada geese fly overhead. Using her memory of her old home and her family, applied to her new surroundings, Saeng vows to re-take the test, to try again. The author ends the story �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up.	2	3		3																					
2983	4	"The author concludes with this story to show how Saeng is ready to accept her new life. Once the geese and the hibiscus are back she feel like she's at home. When she feels more at home is when she will be ready to take the test again. The text states �run and the geese return"" this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again�. Clearly the geese and hibiscus remind her of home.Once she feels at home, she will feel at ease. Thats why the author concluded with this pasage."	1	2		2																					
2984	4	Why the author concluded with this paragraph was because it showed a restated the main idea of the story and the readers understood what the story was about. That is why the author concluded the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2985	4	The author explains that she has failed the test. While it is still winter and the hibiscus is still trying to grow it's lovely peddles back. As she tells her mother �that she will not take the test again, until the hibiscus starts budding and spring is back.	1	1		1																					
2986	4	Yes, I do think that this concludes the story because after all of that in the story and all that learning about gardening from her mother, she remembers what her mother had said about the hibiscus and its bidding. And what she means by this ending sentence is that when the spring time comes, then she is going to take that test again. the test will determine whether or not she has learned enough about gardening from her mother over the past time.	0	0		0																					
2987	4	The author concludes the Story with this paragraph because I guess her grandma died while the geese were flying. Or thats when the flowers start to bloom.	0	0		0																					
2988	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus� included the last paragraph to convey to readers that she will be moving on, but still remembering her old country. Before finding the flower, the author terribly missed her old country. ""It�s-it�s not a real one, �Saeng mumbled. 'I mean not like the kind we had at-at� she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, last she burst into tears again."" She missed her home in the other country and was having trouble getting past it. The author could not accept her new country as home yet. Saeng, the hibiscus flower brought back memories of her old country, making it even more difficult to move on.� One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb."" The flower was too much of a memory. She finally had something from home that she could hold. �Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold onto.� The author now had a solid thing to remind her of home. This was the first step to finally moving on. Now Saeng needed some time to get use to her new country. �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become almost familiar to her now.� Saeng needed just a little more time, almost like a hibernation. She decided once the hibiscus came out of hibernation, and was ready to bloom, she would be ready to accept her new country and move on. Saeng decide the time between fail and spring would be long enough to adjust to her new life. By taking the test, Saeng will be moving on. The author included this last paragraph so that readers can infer that Saeng will take the last steps towards acceptance of her new country and move on by taking the test, although she will look back on her old country through the winter hibiscus."	3	3		3																					
2989	4	The story includes this paragraph because at the very beginnig of the story the girl failed the test. And so when she told her mother she saw that she was upset with it. So after they planted the plant she decided to take the test over knowing that her mother would think the best of it. Also its in there because the story started out with her telling her mother that she failed the test.  And if you kept it out people who read it would be like, ok, so her mother just let her fail the test and didn�t do anything about it. Plus when the reader reads that the girl failed the test, they are going to be wanting to know if she took it again, and why she took it again if she did.	1	1		1																					
2990	4	The author ended the story with an unconcluded ending. What I mean is the author wrote so that he could keep readers interested so that they would want to read his other books. Also, with an ending of that sort it kind of leaves room for improving and room for a sequal.	1	1		1																					
2991	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up until she successfully passes the task he mother gives her.Saeng fails the test because, though she buys a beautiful plant it is much to expensive. �But how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn�t cost that much!� Saeng becomes very upset and realizes that she has failed her mother. Saeng still plants the winter hibiscus in the ground. �Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the �winter hibiscus� into it.� This shows that even though she had failed she wasn�t going to give up on the hibiscus because it represented her home. It was very special to her.	1	1		1																					
2992	4	The Author concludes the with paragraph because she wont to.	0	0		0																					
2993	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story the character � Saeng� is feeling homesick and has not adapted to her new country. She is on her way home from her driver�s test, which she just failed, and on the way she sports a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hishiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort in time of disappoint, connection to her past experiences and ability to overcome obsticales. Saeng has not adjusted to this change in her life and it has affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obsticates in your life but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome it. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and showing the reader that saeng was the hibiscus as her way of overcoming and when she is ready and she has ajusted she will take her driving test again.	3	2		3																					
2994	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he�s saying that once winter and spring�s over and the hibiscus is budding, then I�ll start over again and try again. The author is saying saeng can�t wait till spring so she can plant her own little garden. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2995	4	"This paragraph represents an action that Saeng is going to do over a time period of a year. She is going to build up and change in time for the retake of the test its like a rebirth in a way. The girl wants to be a whole new person for when the test comes up again. Her mom seems to be bothered by every action or choice of her daughters. The daughter suddenly relizes the action for the hibiscus and why it dies. ""... thought the quiet repetition of season upon season."" She relates the flower and geese to herself. Over the year the flower goes through phases dying then rebirth. Saeng wants to get better once she goes through a phase like the flower. Its opens up to be beautiful again.  "	2	3		3																					
2996	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because when she come back from taking driver's test on the way home she saw winter hibiscus that was so beautiful. Then she went to the store and buy that flowers and it cost a lot of money when she got home and her mom planting vejetable and her mom ark her what is that so she tell th truth and her know that the flower costs a lot of money she get mad with the dheredulously of her how can she do that - Saeng take a big decision that she going to that eventhough her mom mad she she love that flowers I guess because it remaind of in Vietnam. The author put this paragraph I think because that the geese return and the flowers is growth she will take the test again bease that when she buy is no flowers came out yet so when it came out she will go again just to let her know that you see the first time and waite when it growth than you can take the test again In my onpion that is a good ending and also it a good question too.	1	2		2																					
2997	4	"The author concludes the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself...,"" because it offers the reader a conclusion. That passage means that Saeng will try talking her drivers test again once she has adjusted to her new life in a new country. Once she can find familiarity in her surroundings she will feel more at home. Throughout the story, her detatchment from Vietnam makes her feel alone. The hibiscus plant is what first offers her a sense of comfort, ""It felt smooth and cool... just as she had known it would feel."" The ending paragraph shows that Saeng will find more comfort in @LOCATION2 than just a plant and a couple of geese."	3	2		3																					
2998	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when the �snow does melt and the Geese return� it will be time t plant and work in the garden even more, because with snow on the ground you can�t plant but the geese back if the time of year to plant the seed and have are bad flock/fasten grander. The test is to she if she can have a better grade than last years, and year befor that.	0	0		0																					
2999	4	The author concluded his storie with that paragraph is because thats how it should end and that�s why he ended it like   that.     	0	0		0																					
3000	4	The author concludes the story with �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She does this to show now Saeng is adapting and making decisions in her new country just like she did in her homeland. In Vietnam Saeng used to brush her grandmothers hair and help put it into a bun and put a hibiscus in it. That was one of her traditions with it. Also when she used to get water from the well a hibiscus would sometimes come up with the bucket. Both these thus the hibiscus was seen as a comfort object, now as she is in the states, she is trying to put it to good use, while also taking into account what repeats in the states. She notices that the geese come back in the spring and leave in the winter, and plants start to grow in the spring. By her taking the test again in the spring it is symbolizing that she is ready to start test just like the hibiscus that is going to bloom. The plant being potted in her garden and Saeng moving her both signify change, but a rembrance of old traditions, and a space for new.     	3	3		3																					
3001	4	The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese.	1	1		1																					
3002	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph To show the final determination and strength Saeng has been given. It�s almost as though it�s taken this plant To show her to get back up and pass the Test. The plant becomes a comporting item that reminds her of her homeland. She returned with the plant To show her mother but found herself too shaky to even say the words �at home"". This shows how much she misses home. But she is able to realize that this is her new home and everything is becoming more familiar To her. "	2	2		2																					
3003	4	She ends it with this sentence because its a sign of new life. Just as the winter that killed the plants ending life, the spring will come and start anew. This is how Saeng feels because she left her country and all the memories left behind she feels out of place like the winter hibiscus but as the spring comes she�ll feel as anew person ready and able to take challenges as she said here �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now� she describes that with a new season comes new changes and upon those changes she will go on to take the drivers test again.	3	2		3																					
3004	4	The author end with that paragraph for several reasons. One is to show that she has failed this time, more opportunities will come later. Also, it shows that even though bad times befall her now, good times are still to come. For several reasons, it was a powoful efficient way to end the story.	1	1		1																					
3005	4	The author uses symbolism to convey a different message. Saeng said in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, and then I will take that test again. The author uses the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng gets older like the hibiscus, that then she will be ready to take that test again. The author uses symbolize to convey more of the story.	2	2		2																					
3006	4	She wrote that response to tell everyone   that  she  will  be ready  but the time when spring  comes.    Then   she  take it and pass.	1	1		1																					
3007	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng wants to start planting again. I know this because Saeng life revolves around planting and @CAPS1. Saeng and her mother get there food from what they plant. So all @DATE1 they spend most there time in the garden. growing crops to sell and save. They save for winter and sell to get there equiement to continue whot they do. The part she talking about in the paragraph that say �when they come back� talking about the geese. She loves the geese flying over her head and landing in the yard when she outside on a beauttiful day @CAPS1. when The snow melts she wants to  get back at in the soil on her hands and knee to start planting again. Once the hibiscus start budding everything else starts growing. Saeng live revolves around @DATE1 planting. The author put this paragraph in the story because this is what saeng wants to do more than anything.	1	0		1																					
3008	4	In the conclusion of the �Winter Hibiscus� Saeng notes how she will retake  her driving test in the spring when the snow melt sand the geese return.The spring is when these events occur along with the annual budding  of the  winter  hibiscus. Her family had moved from Vietnam to @LOCATION2, and she had bought a winter hibiscus  plant  to remind  her of  her  childhood. When it blooms, she  will retake her driving test because the body will bring her the hope of a new beginning in her life, and as a citizen in @LOCATION2.	2	2		2																					
3009	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� a young girl named Saeng moves away from home. This short story is the girl is trying to adapt to the new lifestyle and changes.	1	1		1																					
3010	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she want the reader to see that saeng will not stop until she passes her drivers test, just like the geese won�t stop until they are in the south for winter. the author is trying to show the beauty of trying again and going through your obstcles to your goal.	1	2		2																					
3011	4	"In the stoRy �WinteR Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authoR leaves the stoRy off with a poweRful ending. The ending was �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to heRself, in the spRing, when the snows melt and the geese RetuRn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will tRy the test again"". Basically the authoR concluded the stoRy with that because it shows she's poweRful, that she's willing to tRy and make heRself stRongeR, that she's willing to tRy again, and that she wants to help heRself. Text examples to pRoove this would be, �then I will take the hibiscus test again,"" ""Almost Reluctantly, she Realized that many of the things that she had thought of as stRange befoRe had become..."", and ""TheRe was a fRail, wiRy beauty to heR that touched Saeng deeply."" All those statements help backup why the authoR might leave such poweRful paRagRaph foR last."	1	2		2																					
3012	4	"Thes Author, In the story �Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph to show how often Saeng gets tested by her memories. Saeng has ""tested"" erlier in the story when she was in a flourist. Memories come rushing back to her like a flood and she tried to feel the same as she did long ago whe her grandmother was there, and she realized that things in her memories were long gone, so she wept. Saeng reported to her mother that she had failed the test, and bought the plant to try and comfort herself. Her mother was very understanding and accepted it. Saeng planted the habiscus and at the end says that ""In the spring when the snow melts, this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". Saeng knew seeing the flower again will make her cry, will make her memories come back, she will be re tested."	2	1		2																					
3013	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by @CAPS1 Ho a girl named Saeng failed her drivers test that day then vowed that she would retake from the spring. She ends with this statement to say that it is a new season and a new beginning for her into her new life. This archetype being the changing from harsh cold winter to nice warm spring time shows that the trouble her mother and Saeng would get better. As hard trouble winter left than their is calmwarm new beginning spring. Saeng knows this and knows that she is going to pass."	2	1		2																					
3014	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for various reasons. For example, the whole passage is talking about how the hibiscus flower provides Saeng with the ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort her in a time of disappointment. This ending paragraph shows that �in the spring, when the hibiscus is budding,� and everything is beautiful again then Saeng will take her test again. She knows that with the help of the hibiscus plant, that she will pass the test. It shows that her hope and trust to pass the test comes from the hibiscus flower. The plant with �waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers� will provide her the strength, determination, courage, and will power to pass the test in the spring.	2	2		2																					
3015	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�, the author ends with the statement, �...then I�ll take the test again.� This shows that Saeng is willing to try to adapt to this new place she lives in. That is what refers to when she says �test�. For example, in the story she said, �I-I failed the test,� when her mother asked her what was wrong. She spent so much money on that plant hopping to stay home in her mind. She just couldn�t handle that. She ends with the positive statement because it just sends the message that she looks foward to a bright future in her new home.	1	1		1																					
3016	4	In the story �winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. She puts in examples from the story that could help find these reasons. One reason is that we know she wont give up. In the story she says �Then I will take the test again.� It tells us that she will keep trying and is determined to do so. Another reason is that she�s trying to tell us that there is a future for the hibiscus. How is when she says ��and this hibiscus is budding,� that the hibiscus has a chance to change and get use to its surroundings, just like the girl in the story will be doing. Last reason is that it tells us that she is and will be doing her best. When she says �she realized that many of the things that she had thought were strange�, almost familiar to her now,� @CAPS1 trying to get use to her surroundings and now realizes she can. In the story there are many reasons to suspect shy she ended the story with that paragraph. She gives examples in the story that makes many people get many	3	2		3																					
3017	4	"The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding. This shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring. This gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive. Another hardship that she and the hibiscus both @CAPS1 is being ""root bound."" The author misses her home oF Vietnam very much. However, both oF them must and will adOpt to their new environments.."	3	2		3																					
3018	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that she misses her home and that affected her driving test. At her home country it was warm and she had all her family memories. In the new country it is cold and snowy, something she isn�t used to. It states she will take the test again when all them things happen because it will feel like her home country and she will be more focused on the test and not what she misses.	1	2		2																					
3019	4	The author Minfong Ho concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus�, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, �.. in the spring...� it�s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It�s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  	3	3		3																					
3020	4	She ended it with that paragraph because she wanted to prove even though she misses the �old centry� she will adapt and survive.	1	1		1																					
3021	4	I think the author conclades the story with this paragraph because it sounds hopeful. She wasn�t adapting to her new home very well and that made her feel hopeless.Saeng failed her driving test which only made things worse for her. To make things better, she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home. She found the plant to be very comforting and it helped her get passed the tough times. In the last paaragraph, Saeng is looking forward to the spring so she can retake the test and hopefully pass it this time. I think the paragraph provides a feeling of hopefulness which is way the author concluded the story the way they did.	2	2		2																					
3022	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will not give up and there is still hope. It is also to teach the reader to have hope and patience and the knowledge that things take time. Saeng failed the test of not giving into her sorrows and misery of missing her country. She says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This shows that she is adjusting. So by ending it with this and comparing to the geese, its showing that she is getting stronger. She will take the test again because she wont give up.	2	2		2																					
3023	4	Clearly From rending the story Winter @CAPS1, the author @CAPS2 this phrase �when they come Back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test Again� in the story because the passage relates to the title of the story Winter @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
3024	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because, even though Saeng didn�t do well on her last test, Saeng will go back and take it again so she can pass it. The author is showing Saeng�s determination to pass the test and do better next time.	1	1		1																					
3025	4	I think the author ends the story with that paragraph because it is linting the plant that stands for many positive things to the character that failed the test that the really wanted to pass. Both the character and the plant show perservirance and I think the author is trying to send a message to the reader to never give up on something you want to accomplish. The plant gives an emblem of perseverance because it survives through the harsh winter. The main character isn�t giving up on the test she wants to pass. The author is giving a message not to give up.	2	2		2																					
3026	4	At the end of the story the author says �when they come back in the spring, whe the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that again.� The author concludes this at the end because she felt like she didn�t do her best because she failed so when the spring comes again She is going to retry to do it and hopefully this time she will past.  	1	1		1																					
3027	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because she wants to come back an an do smell test again when the snow melts and the geese return.	0	0		0																					
3028	4	The @ORGANIZATION1 is about a girl named Saeng She is a teenager her family just moved to the United States from Vietnam, Saeng failed her driving test and on the walk home discovers this beautiful plant named Hibiscus she falls in love with the Hibiscus. Saeng's mother has a garden she is always planting things a using plarts a veggies from her garden for dinner. The author conclude a paragraph that says where the Hibiscus plants are budding in the spring Saeng with take the test again. I think Saeng says this because she wants to see the beautiful plants When she passes the test and she thinks seeing th Hibiscus will help her passthe driving test.	1	2		2																					
3029	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is giving herself hope on passing her test. The hibiscus will have started sprouting and the will give her the strength to take the test again and hopeful pass it all because of the winter hibiscus reminded her of home.	2	1		2																					
3030	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph of ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because this paragraph can show that the hibiscus is the reason why Saeng wants to try the test again. If the hibiscus is budding after the snow melt and the geese return, then she can do as the hibiscus be strong and won�t give up on her test."	1	1		1																					
3031	4	The author concludes the story with this to show that saeng won�t give up. It is possible to adapt and try to love whats around you. Saeng struggled to get out �I-I failed the test� and couldn�t say �at home� this shows her insecurity and lonleiness for the new world around her and by saying she will try again in the spring gives the reader hope that she will adapt and love her surroundings. She goes through an expirence today that old life and comparing it to the one she is living in now they have some simalarities and because she will try again in the spring means she has decided to go to give a new place a chance.	2	2		2																					
3032	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she says �Then I Will take that test again� she believes in the Flowers. she and the Flowers both adapte to there circumstances. They both being determined to @CAPS1 in @CAPS2 places. They both overcome obstacles. Maybe she wants to see what lays ahead. she hopes she is right about the Flowers maybe, she likes the spring.	2	1		2																					
3033	4	I actually like the way the author concludes the story with this paragraph. It basically sumarizises the story and sums it up into few words that would want you to wonder what happened next, and if there is a sequel. This is a very good story that I personally can relate to in many ways.	1	1		1																					
3034	4	The reason why the author concludes this type of senerario is simply because the author has a pain to cross and or a situation in this particular author you know son but if you get it straight you�ll open your eyes and see that its your time to shine you might as well grab it before you loose your chance you only get one day to prove you are worthy to the people.	0	0		0																					
3035	4	The author concludes with this sentence because he is showing the girls cofidence in herself. It also gives her enough time to get ready for the next test. Also she knows she will be ready when her flower starts to bud.	1	1		1																					
3036	4	Why did the author concludes the story with this paragraph. Is so he can right another story budding on vowed silently and he will right the. Story in the spring when they come back	0	0		0																					
3037	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was saying that if it is possible for these things to happen then she should be able to take the test and pass it. She was comparing things together that she knew that do noot go together. For example she said that in spring when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then she would take the test over. She meant that if the thing she likes the most overcomes its obstacle then she would do what hurted her the most over again. She doesn�t know if she takes the test over she would keep trying over and over until she passes it. In the story she doesn�t know to fit in. All she knows is what she learned in her country . All she have to do is try harder and she maybe will be able to pass his test .	2	2		2																					
3038	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paraghragh because when she told her mom she failed her test she was crying, But I think it was deeper than that. I think she missed home so much that she couldn't concentrate. She had to cry about something because she didn't want to let her mom know that she misses home.	1	1		1																					
3039	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concludes the story because as if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel.	0	0		0																					
3040	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it is showing that the hibiscus inspires her and gives comfort that no person could try and do. For example, after Saeng failed her drivers test, she was disappointed. On her way home she saw a hibiscus and went to a florist shop to try and buy it. Saeng took a peddle from the plant and held it tightly while she closed her eyes. The plant reminded her of her real home in vietnam which she loved. The hibuscus became a form of comfort for Saeng since she had just failed her drivers test, even though the plant was not the same as the one at home. By the author ending the story with Saeng saying she will wait until the hibiscus starts budding to take the test again, it shows that the hibiscus helps her to overcome obstacles in life and it helps her to get through hardships she faces.	2	1		2																					
3041	4	What Saeng means at the end of the paragraph is that where it is a seasson for those plants she will take the test again. The test to begin to like like the plot. Like features and characters about. Also the history about these plants. 	0	0		0																					
3042	4	She is demanding to not take the test again if the winter hibiscus don't come back she was upset that she had failed the test. She spent most of her day looking at the hibiscus but she was still upset that they were�nt the real ones back at home. Her mother said they are strong enough to make it through the winter. when they come back  Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again	1	1		1																					
3043	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because is symbolizes the hope that things will get better. The author ends with hope because the flower symbolizes the girl and the girl saying that if the flower can survive the year. So can she. This symbolizes hope because the girl is realizing that it is going to take time before she can adapt to her new country but eventually she will. This is meaningful because the girl considers the day that she had to be horrible and that this statement ends the day on a good note. The girl spends the entire day wishing that she were back in her own country and missing her grandmother and friends. But this paragraph is the girl vowing a promise to her self that she will withstand the winter until spring and it will get better when she can take the test again. The entire story builds up to this turning point when Saeng realizes that she will make it through this struggle just like this flower will make it through the winter. Saeng realizes that it is going to take time for her to adapt to this new and strange country and the new lifestyle that she must adopt	3	3		3																					
3044	4	The author concludes this story with this sentence, because it shows hope for the future. This sentence lets readers know that times are hard now, but in time things will get better. Saeng might have failed this test, but shes not giving up hope on passing it. She believes she will pass that test in the spring, when the time is right. Saeng might miss her home, but she won�t tell that interfer with her future. That is why the author concludes the story with �when they comeback, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return andthis hibiscus is budding, then I will take that tests again.	2	1		2																					
3045	4	What the author is talking about is that the snow was melting and the spring is coming. I guess what they mean is that flowers, trees and grass are going back beautiful. Also he was letting us know that spring is here and that is not winter nomore. Thats why she start to plant plants in the winter. So in the spring that can grow out to be nice and beautiful for the spring. Thats what i think the author meant. Also thats the reason why he put that in the paragraph. He should of add more to the paragraph like how the plants and stuff was growing so beautiful. He shouldn't add more details to let us know, what was talking about in this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3046	4	"The author chose to end the story in this way because it effectively ties in different aspects and principles of the story. For example, this sentence includes both the geese and the hibiscus, representing her new home, and the old, together in harmony. It also states that ""... Saeng vowed silently to herself... I will take that test again,"" which relates to the determination of the hibiscus flower, which struggles persistently through the winter. A lot of wisdom can be gathered from the symbolic messages hidden within that final sentence It implies that, though the past @MONTH1 be behind you, it is with you in your heart as you face new challenges, and if you are determined, those challenges can be conquered."	1	2		2																					
3047	4	The authar concludes the story with the paragraph they because it shows saeng determination and her overcoming her obstacles of being new in a country. With all of the doubts saeng had right after her test it is very big of her to come to this conclusion of retaking the test, �Here, let me help you mother,she offered� (HO). With her mom comforting her and telling her it is @CAPS1, gives saeng the boost she needs to help her mother and think to herself that she can�t let just one thing hold her back in life. the support saeng has she will definetly pass the test the next time.	2	1		2																					
3048	4	"In the story �winter Hibiscus� the author Minfong Ho ends with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" she ended with this show her determination to do good in her country and show that memories of her grandmother help her to strive for the best in her new country, in her new home. In the beginning of the story Saeng is at a flower shop and she sees all the flowers of her home country growing in poto. At the sight of all these flowers memories flood back to her, memories that bring her joy and sadness. Then when she returns home she tells her mother that she failed the test you can tell from her actions that she is disappointed, �I-I failed the test  Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye  nervously tore off a leab,shredding it to bits�. After a while she planted the flower in the vegetable garden. The buying and planting of the vegetable shows that Saeng wants to remember her grandmother and home. Thinking  about her grandmother helps her to survive for better, helps her want to succeed in her new home. Memories of her grandmother make her sad but in away make her happy.  "	3	2		3																					
3049	4	The author concludes the story this way with a quote that says she will get another try at something. Many authors end stories at a diff way because it makes the reader wants to go on to a sequal or the next story, and I really adds a twist to the ending. Also another reason a author would end like that is because they want you to work your imagination so you picture what happens next. Using this is effective because you know what has happened and It make the reader wonder if she  fails or succeeds the next time around.	1	1		1																					
3050	4	The author closes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is willing to try again. Even though it @MONTH1 not be right away, Saeng wants to try to see all of the flowers that remind her of home again without breaking down. She can tell that although her mother is understanding, Saeng has let her down a little bit. �But how could you? You know how much we�what happened?� when her mother says this, she feels that she has let her mother down. But then, Mrs. Panouvong expresses that she is glad Saeng got it, after hearing that she had failed. Sensing her mother�s inkling of disappointment, Saeng wants to try again.	2	2		2																					
3051	4	Most likely the author concludes this story with that paragraph because the author wanted to show that Saeng was a very determined person. The author wanted to show readers that Saeng was a strong character because throughout the story she seemed very determined to pass the test for the first time. But when she failed, the author wanted to show that Saeng was not going to give up hope and that she was going to take the test again.	1	1		1

3053	4	"The author concludes the story with the sentence ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" because he is making a point about immigration. The point the author is making is that when immigrants came to @CAPS1 they were told to forget where they were from . The word test in the story means getting used to @LOCATION1 and forgetting her homeland. Saeng  says thoes words because she failed the test and bought something that reminded her of her homeland. In conclusion the Author is describing how immigrants were treated and told to forget who they were because their in @LOCATION1 now."	0	1		1																					
3054	4	In the story �Winter @CAPS1� the author was trying to saying that Saeng was from somewhere then where he is now. In the text It say�s �It was like walking into another world so he is there thinking like no boby know him except for him and him only.	0	0		0

3056	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� Saeng took her driver�s test and failed it. She she wants to try and take it again in the spring. I think she ends the story say that because in the spring the hibiscus plant that she got and her and her mom planted, will be growing and blooming and the geese will be back with makes her feel more at home. That way she will feel comfort and be able to take the test and pass, because it will remind her of being home.  	2	2		2																					
3057	4	In the end of the story they say that she will take the test over again, in the spring when the geese come back from the winter fly. What they are saying is that she will make a fresh start in the spring when the geese come back, so she would just be starting all over again fresh new start to a new year and a new time to study for the big test and time to regroup from the last test that she took and failed the test she will just get a new start and a new chance to do something over again. Her mom was in disbelief when she found out that she failed the test, her mom said to her that it will be ok and you can take it over again, in a new season,	1	2		2																					
3058	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is thinking what it will be like when all of this happens. Saeng said; �when they come back, she vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.	0	0		0																					
3059	4	The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to end on a good note and show hope for the future. First, throughout the story Saeng felt lonely and depressed because she missed her home in Vietnam. With all this depression Saeng saw the winter hibiscus that reminded her of her childhood memories. She felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life. The flower represented the light and hope for the future. Next, it shows perserverance factor in the story Saeng fails her drivers test and came home feeling unacomplished. When she says she will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms it shows perserverance and never giving up. Lastly, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and show a positive outlook on life. No matter where you come from with love and perserverance you can overcome any obstacle. Whether it be your school, tests or home with a little hardwork and faith you can achieve.	3	3		3																					
3060	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show thatshe will do this once she  has gotten use to the change of her new country. When she says, �When the geese return� their faint honks and flying overhead are familiar to her now season upon season. Also when the hibiscus is budding because this will remind her of her home in Vietnam seeing flower and hearing these geese will give her the confidence and encouragement to retake the drivers test.	2	2		2																					
3061	4	MY detail on Saeng vowed silentlY to herself because she had difficuiltY makeing new friends.

3062	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus �decided to end the story with this paragraph because its like a new beginning for saeng. In saeng moves and fails the test .The winter hibiscus comforts her from the memories of where she used to live. It gives her hope and in the winter it wouldn�t be as nice as it would be in the spring. Spring is also time for new beginnings because in the winter everything dies and comes back to life in spring .saeng feels she would take the test as a new beginning. From my personal experience I always do spring cleaning because I want to begin fresh. Spring is also filled with fresh air and gives me inspiration to do good. This could be why saeng wants to take the test in the spring time. Therefore the author of �Winter Hibiscus �decided to end the story with that paragraph because they wanted to show how saeng wanted a new beginning.  	3	2		3																					
3063	4	"Authors sometimes conclude a story with a certain paragraph describing an action that will take place in the future. In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author concludes the paragraph by saying �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� One reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to help show that things will change come spring. For example in the story the girl saids �I-I failed the test.� By her saying this and talking about how she failed her driving test come spring she can change. She can get better, so that this time she will pass. Also, �The ""winter hibiscus� was in the ground now, and @CAPS1 tamped down the soil around it.� This quote helps show that the hibiscus is being planted now, but come spring it will have changed color and have bloomed. In conclusion authors end stories with a paragraph like this to help show the changes that could happen in the future."	2	2		2																					
3064	4	The author, Minfong  Ho, concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The  �budding hibiscus� symbolizes comfort for her. When moving to @LOCATION1 she couldn�t take all her friends a possessions with her, but she could bring memories. The flower reminds her of home, which is comforting after she failed her drivers test. In addition, the �geese returning� symbolizes a new beginning. After being away for so long, the geese returning ushers  in springs a time to start all over after a dreasy  winter. Finally �;,.then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 that one should never give up. Even though ve was hard for her to adapt to a new  country, she made friends a tried @CAPS2 foods, like a Big @CAPS3. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the story with the paragraph to show comfort, new beginnings  a never give up.	3	3		3																					
3065	4	The reason why the aurthor wanted to put that last paragraph down because they want to keep the reader interested in the story. Another reason why she/@CAPS1 put that in the story; @CAPS2/@CAPS3 it is letting the reader know that plant will never give up.	0	0		0																					
3066	4	The author concludes the story with the quote, �when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again,� to show that she is encouraged by the memories of her homeland. For example, in the story it stated that she realized that many things were similar to things in her homeland. As the seasons went by she discovered the similarities. The spring time reminded saeng of her home, so when at comes she will be motivated to take the test again. In conclusion, the author included the quote to show how she is encouraged by memories of her homeland.	1	2		2																					
3067	4	The author concludes the story with the main character vowing to take the drivers test again to symbolize moving forward. � Saeng felt a shock of recognition so inffuse, it was almost visceral.� A  pone stumbling to a florist shop the main character sees a flower that reminded her of her home land, Vietnam. �Here, let me help, mother.� In relieving  her mother in the task of planting the seed that she had bought she began to mature. After reflecting on the memories of her past and coming to peace with there   there   was nothing left stoping   her from moving  forward. �when   they come back  I will take that test again.� As she sees   geese migrating south for the winter in a v formation she sets a goal for herself and uses that goal as a tool to help herself grow and move foward in the new country she�s in. The main character vowing in �Winter Hibiscus� symbolizes moving   foward.	3	2		3																					
3068	4	It shows in this time of doubt that she will overcome. In the story the plant showed hope and in showing this gave her hope. All the memories that she recalled had made her sad at first but in the end gave her hope.	1	1		1																					
3069	4	I think the author concludes the story with that statement simply because, mabe he is trying to send out some sort of message to people and get their attention The author also could of concluded the story off with that statement because mabe he Just felt like he need to do that, mabe he didn't have a particular reason for doing it.	0	0		0																					
3070	4	"The author of ""Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the paragraph ""When they come back,Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then she will take the test again"" because its sympatizing Saeng ability to overcome her sorrow and give the test another chance.this is symbolised by when she says ""when the geese return and the hibiscus"" After fail of the test. She wasn't own considering retaking the test, but instead, just wished she could return to her old home and not how to think about it. But much like the geese returning in the spring, she says she will retake the test. She is like the geese because they overcome and adopt the cold harsh weather by flying elsewhere and returning when it's warm, like her she must wait until she is more ready and confident to take the test the second time around. The Hibiscus budding is symbolizing her strength and determination to pass the test the second time she takes it,because just like her the hibiscus survive the cold weather months, @CAPS1 bloom in the spring so must she last through the weather to pass in the spring. That is why the author consider the story with the paragraph to show that she hasn't given up and will take the test again, A sured that  to pass"	2	3		3																					
3071	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator wants to retake the test and is waiting for a better time.

3073	4	At the end of the story, winter Hibiscus, the author's concluding paragraph shows many of the aspects of the story in a summary, Saeng is determined to go back to the drivers test and is open to a new beginning. The author used these concluding words in the paragraph to express the hope in Saeng of a better beginning and to show her determination to pass the drivers test. The author ties the objects in-a story to represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus is a reminder of her glorious home, spring is the time she picks because it is a new beginning, and the geese returning show the determination of her and her to resolve to become new and better.	2	2		2																					
3074	4	The author minFong @CAPS1 concludes the story with this paragraph to envoke hope within the reader towards the characters in the story. One of the most important lessions anyone can learn in life is to never lose hope because things will get better so long as you try. Though Saeng was sad over failing her driving test and missed her homeland deeply, with ending the story and this paragraph, the principal that �never giving up is important� is presented and carried out hopefully through the character�s vow. This principal presents the idea that people can overcome hard times in their life no matter what circumstances they are presented with. In conclusion, hope is envoked within the reader because of the ending paragraph which contributes to the over all theme of the entire story; it is important to never give up and always have hope especially when life gets hard.	2	2		2																					
3075	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sounds better and it makes the story sound a bit more better when the author put that paragraph in the start. If the author did not put that ending at the end of the story the story probably wouldnt be that intresting and be that good of a story if the author didn�t put that ending paragraph at the end of the story. Also the author wants to make the reader understand the story end end or the start all at the same time. For example if there were no good ending at the end of this story no body would want to read at all not a bit so it was a good thing for the author to put a good end stable ending paragraph at the end of the story. I think ic it was a very good paragraph for the end of the story. It just really seemed to mach the story and I could also really understand it a lot better because of the ending paragraph. It was just the perfect ending for this story.	0	0		0																					
3076	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to explain to us that this plant is going to bring good luck. The snow will melt, the geese will return and the hibiscus plant will start budding. Its starting over fresh, a new beggining. Since she had failed her driving test she will start over in the spring. In conclusion this is why I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3077	4	Why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is pretty much to say in the spring when the plant starts over Saeng will start over to. The story shows that this is the meaning because Saeng was having a really hard winter and was having a hard time adjusting to all of the new things, but in the spring she can start over just like the hibiscus will.	1	1		1																					
3078	4	The Author includes this paragraph to this story in many reasons why. One reason why is because the story started off by saying and talking about Saeng failing her drivers test and being depressed over it. Then it gets into talking about the hibiscus and how it reminds her of homeland and all of the good memories that she has experienced. This all relates to this paragraph because Saeng will not return to the testing again until the thing that makes her happy and confident, the hibiscus starts to bud. That paragraph relates to every little bit of this story from the beginning to the end.	2	2		2																					
3079	4	I think the author concludes this in the story because when they come back is when the character feels she would be prepare to take that test again.	1	1		1																					
3080	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphisise the theme that changes in life are hard to adjust to. Saeng has moved to @LOCATION1 and longs for home. The flowers in the greenhouse reminds her of where she grew up and her grandmother. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying. She tells her mom that she did not pass the test but in the last paragraph she vowed to herself that by spring she will. The author is giving us insight to Saeng's character. We now know that eventhough it is difficult for Saeng to let go of what she knows and love, she will have the strength to make it in a new world.?"	2	2		2																					
3081	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show us that her days with nature is not yet over, for when it comes back around, she will continue to do what she been was doing, whicvh was growing her plants, taking care of them, tuning them out to being a goodnight dinner, and to continue that until she�s no longer to do anymore.	0	0		0																					
3082	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because the author is showing how she feels more comfortable with her old home. The winter hibiscus is related to her new home but when winter is gone and new hibiscus came they relate to her new home. The hibiscus from her old home give her a sense of comfort. So when she feels that comfort again she will be brave and go take the test. The author ended the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng still doesn�t like the change and would like to go back to her old home	2	2		2																					
3083	4	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a new country. In this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so. Saeng took a test and failed and in the winter, flowers fail but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms Saeng will ""bloom"" and try the test again. Moving can be a hardship especially when it is to place very unfimiliar. People find ways to make themselves promises & to remind them of their old home."	2	2		2																					
3084	4	The author concludes the stoRy with this paragraph because this spRing she had made a mistake like buying the plants that were oveR @MONEY1 (dollaRs) and her motheR who disappointed with heR. So she figuRes That when The spRing comes again she could get another oppoRtuniy to do her best and to get it right This time. Also so she will not be a disappointment to heR motheR.	1	1		1																					
3085	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph because she said that the flower helps her with the moving and remains her of her home town and that when the geese come back and the flower starts to blume she�ll know that she can pass that test. She is sad for failing the test but it doesn�t matter how many times you fail it sooner or later you will pass the test. She must feel comfortable taking the test again when spring comes along.	1	1		1																					
3086	4	I believe that the author concluded the story �Winter @CAPS1� with the paragraph that she did in order to imply that Saeng will not give up. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was very sad about failing the test, but will take the test again infers that Saeng is a determined person. It is my belief that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the feeling that Saeng was determined despite hardships.	2	1		2																					
3087	4	"In the story, ""Winter Hibiscus,"" by @CAPS1 Ho, the authorconcludes the story with, ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt. and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again'' because the hibiscus represents hope and adapting to circumstances. Saeng is trying to adapt to the new changes in herlife but nothing is working out for her.""She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst in to tears again.""@CAPS2, the Hibiscus makes her life easier because it reminds her of her homeland, @CAPS3 it gives her hope, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing, '''the root-bound represents Saeng inher new country. Unwilling to try anything, and getting scared but assoon as Saeng and her mother plant the hibiscus, Saeng realizes that by planting it, she is going to try to love her new life in @LOCATION1 and in spring when the hibiscus and Saeng is ready to blossom, she will start trying to accept life."	3	3		3																					
3088	4	Mingfong Ho closes the story with that paragraph because it shows how far Saeng has come and her determination to persevere. The narrator says, �She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance �(Ho @NUM1). This is when Saeng is recovering from crying and even though she misses her homeland, she wants to adapt and succeed where she is now. The narrator also said, �she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again� (Ho @NUM1). Being away from her homeland makes Saeng very ???

3090	4	I believe the author concluded the story with this paragraph because in the story, the author says �through the quiet repitition of season upon season� which means that seasons will come a seasons will go but she�ll always be there, ready to �take the test�	1	1		1

3095	4	This story about believed in yourself, and never giving up it was a story about perseverance. Saeng really believed she could pass her driver's test, and although she was disappointed with result, she found a way to cope with her loss. The hibiscus that flower means a lot to her because she can connect it to her homeland and, and it is a thing of beauty. something she needed at such an ugly time for her. It's always hard o adapt to a new country in a short period of time. I know what it's like when one small thing goes wrong. You can snap and it will feel a lot worse than it actually is. You feel helpless and alone just like the hibiscus growing next to the highway in the photo. Saeng vowed to take her driver�s test again when her hibiscus would bloom in the spring I think the hibiscus really symbolizes Saeng as a person.	2	3		3																					
3096	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons, Saeng was dissapointed for failing her driving test. She found comfort with nature after she went and bought a plant. Saeng must feel that when the geese leave and the hibiscus his not started to bud, she should not take the drivers test. She feels comforted by the return of the geese and budding of the hibiscus. This implies nature comforts her. The author ended it like this because it shows Saeng is not disappointed about failing is anymore. She knows she will have another chance next year when the geese returns and the hibiscus starts to bud. With the comfort of nature, she feels she can pass the test next year.  	2	2		2

3098	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows her determination. Saeng is having problems with both adjusting and adapting to the changes in her new life. we see an example of this when Saeng comes home with her flower, �she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� we see that Saeng bought the flower because it made her feel securit. It was something from home that felt familiar to her and I believe thats why she included the story with this paragraph because next year she will have a sense of security and familiarity when taking the test because the experience she had will be making again.	2	2		2																					
3099	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng is not going to give up. She also concludes with this to tell people that they should never give up and that the should keep on trying. Even if they have to take a break to study or rethinks the plan.	1	1		1

3101	4	He ends the paragraph with this cause he is meaning to say he would rather take the test again when it is beautiful out in conclusion this is why I think The author ends it with this sentence.	1	1		1																					
3102	4	"At the end of the short story, �winter Hibiscus�, the writer Minfong Ho includes somewhat inspirational concluding sentence �when they come back  in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.� I think this sentence was added in order to create a sense of hope for the future, which contrasts so greatly with the depressing nature of the story, creating a happy ending. Throughout the essay, Saeng is depressed she had to leave her homeland so hurriedly losing her childhood and beloved grandmother, �A blink, a channed switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone.� as Saeng narrates in deeper detail. Also contributing to the feelings of sorrow in the story is how much saeng cries remembering her tragic past. Im both the greenhouse, recalling the events of her grandmother such as when she says, �Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s grey hair Saeng would help knot the hair the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it."" and in the garden, when she talks to her mother and plants the flower. After all this sorrow, by putting in a hopeful ending, the writer has successfully allowed a sense of hope for the future.    "	3	3		3																					
3103	4	She say cloning the spring I will take the test again because she know if she failed the test againg her mother will be disappointed of her because she not trying hard enough or maybe them too him never be closer again. The mother think jst because she keep failing the test because of her connection to her past expeirences or effection for her new country. and ability to overcome obstacles ar finally I think she is comforted by memories or her homland..	1	1		1																					
3104	4	The author concludes the story with that quote for one main reason. That reason is that it shows that the girl has hope. In a story one of the best qualities a character can have is hope because it makes the reader interested and helps provide a good morale for the Story. That is why the author concludes the story with that quote.	1	1		1																					
3105	4	The author of this story story created the last paragraph so that it finishes the story with a great ending. The fact of never giving up and try again again and again. The author said, �I will take the test again.� In the story Saeng said, �I failed the test� but now that she isn't giving up. This last paragraph makes a lot of senses and is needed to make this story complete. So just as others don't give up in @LOCATION1, Saeng is doing the same and is retaking the test.	1	1		1																					
3106	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed. Since she has failed the test the first time she wants to overcome her failure and succede in it so the author wants her to look determined in the end.	1	1		1																					
3107	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending but I have no idea on what that means so the author should explain what it means not me.	0	0		0																					
3108	4	The plant was important to Saeng because it was from her home land. Saeng said that she would take her drivers test again when her plant bloomed. The plant wos a reamder of her home I and and what she come from. The plant to Saeng was a form of confidance. Saeng went through handtimes and the plant wos close to her because it wos from her home land.	2	1		2																					
3109	4	I believe the author ended the story with that paragraph to create a sense of wonder. I think this because if you put into context the word �test�, it could mean many things. For example it could mean the test to overcome the sadness of her situation. Also it could mean the test to adjust to her new home when the spring comes. That is why I think the author tried to create a sense of wonder with the final paragraph.	1	2		2																					
3110	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho,is about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing �when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test @NUM1). The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on her way home had seen an assortment of flowers that were indigenous to her homeland. �Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost @NUM2) The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged. Her mother states �It�s flowers aren�t as pretty but it�s strong enough. That�s what @NUM3). Saeng , after hearing this, decides that she could be strong, too, and would try to do her best in school. She would adapt just like the winter hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
3111	4	She said that because she was more intrested in flowers tha a test.	0	0		0																					
3112	4	I believe that the author concludes with this paragraph because it shows the ending of one thing and the beginning of another.After she is upset and thinks about home she realizes that something new is happening and she needs to accept it.So therefore  in the spring she is going to start new like the flower blossom.	1	1		1

3116	4	When the author concluded the narrative by when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take test again demonstrates the ability to overcome obstacles, finding comfort in a time of disappointment, and her connection to her past experiences. First, it demostrates the ability to overcome obstacles because they are obstacles in everyone lives, and you don�t have a choice to conquer them because there are unlimited. So the hibiscus flower represents the obsticles and the weather represent time because weather is stopping the flower to bloom and bloosom. Secondly, it also represent the finding of comfot in a time of disappointment because when you have going through an obstacle you would find disappointment there lingering. However she knows that the hibiscus will be coming back and she have the awareness of the obstacles coming back. Finally, it asserts her connection to her past experience because she is trapped in a world that she is not familiar with, which would make her an alien. She capture the sense of being out of place, because you can relate that the hiatcus flower would be her because she is eccentric and different from the rest of the people in her environment she is trying to adapt her way of living and trying to survive in the world, like when she was in her own country.	2	2		2																					
3117	4	"The author concludes the story with the paragraph because this paragraph represent saeng�s determination and the situation she has now. She just come to the new country and she haven�t adjusted herself to this new country yet. She was disappointed like �mashaft of the war afternoon starlight.� �war� showed saeng was ery upset. After she met the flower, she thought of her old country, her homeland she missed it. She felt that life was full of hope again. She knew she should adjust herself in the new situation she was still too shaky to say the words at home. Last she burst into tears again. She missed her homelad very much �snows"" symbolized the difficult situation she had now. But she believed she could overcome the situation and life was full of hope. �spring� symbolized the hope to the new life saeng thought things would get better in the spring. She would succeed in the spring. She had the determination to succeed, so the author uses that paragraph at conclusion. It symbolizes hope."	3	2		3																					
3118	4	The author included this because she felt that since Saeng failed the test that maybe she should be given a second chance because she tried so hard before. When Saeng says �Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.� It made her mom upset because she used alot of money for one plant just so she could feel at home again since she had one when she was at her old home. Eventually her mom say, �It�s a beautiful plant� to make her feel better because she feels bad for how she acted towards her daughter. After all the things Saeng had to go through is the reason the author added the the last passage into the story.	1	1		1																					
3119	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph the author is saying that Saeng will not quit until she pass that test she try and try and till she die. The author refering to the story again.	1	1		1																					
3120	4	The authors purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return she will have to again take care of the plant. Thats clear because taking a test is a big responsibility therefore taking care of that plant is also a huge task refering  to taking the test again. this is what the purpose of the concluding sentence meant.	1	1		1																					
3121	4	Because planting flowers and wasting on the garden is @CAPS1 hobby. And without it she can�t think clearly or creating. So there fore waiting until they are back will make her happier also she able to do her work.	0	0		0																					
3122	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. One is because she saying when everything gets back to normal that�s when she is going to take the test again. Second, because there would be nothing else to say if it is not back to the way she wanted it to be. For instance, if you were building an house and a blizzared came, you would stop, you said that you would not continue until there was nice weather again. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.	1	1		1																					
3123	4	The author of winter Hibiscus , Minfong Ho ended the story in this way to show the theme of starting over. Her mother adds to the theme of starting over by saying. �Its flowers aren�t as pretty but it�s strong enough to make it through the winter. That�s what matters. �Her words are a metaphor for the family starting their lives again in @LOCATION1, that @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as pretty, but it will survive, which is what matters. Her words soothe her daughters worries about starting ore. Also, the budding hibiscus could be considered asymbol of rebirth, since it is dying and growing with the seasons.The family is dying in out a @CAPS1 family & being @CAPS2 was an @CAPS3 family. However even though they �died� as a @CAPS1 family, that does not meqan that they have lost their heritage which is why the author end talking about a flower that is both @CAPS1 & @CAPS3 just like Saeng.	3	3		3																					
3124	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will perservere through the winter and try to adapt to her new lifestyle. Moving to a new country / culture is extremely tough, and Saeng is bad, but she doesn�t  give up on creating a new life in @LOCATION1. The concluding sentence, �in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test,� is one of determination and hope. The entire story Saeng was struggling with adapting to her non of  and memory of her homeland give has a sense of security. The sentence wraps up her emotion and shows how strong she is @CAPS1  could easily give up on their driving test, but she won�t. It is a happy ending for somewhat of a sad story. Furthering the sentence shows Saeng�s dwoton  the her plant. This hibiscus will survive and so will Saeng when the hibiscus blooms in the spring, so will Saeng. She will try as hard she can to fit in and enjoy her new life. That plant will help her through it by reminding her of vietnam us will as giving her a companion throughout the winter. The  author would not have chosen a better  conclusion for this story. The conclusion orggos  to a new hope to perservere  and sucede. As a result, the reader is test with a sense of pleasure and a good feeling torwards the story. This conclusion show how Saeng is adapting to changes info and hope to enjoy her  new life in @LOCATION1.	3	3		3																					
3125	4	The story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about her �home� where she no longer lived. After she had broke down, bought the plant, and learned to actually accept the fact that she no longer lived in Vietnam and accepting that she had failed her driving test, she realized that she just has to learn to like it. She also learned that her time will come and she will one day be driving. The reason why the auethor concluded the story with this paragraph is because this is the conclusion of the story. this is where one realizes the important things.	1	2		2																					
3126	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story with a statement that Saeng vowed silently to herself. Saeng says she will take the test again referring to the drivers test. Seeing the geese flying in a �V� and seeing the hibiscus gave Saeng a sense of remembrance to her homeland. Saeng misses he homeland. The author wanted it to seem to the @CAPS1 as if Saeng is starting to feel at home again. The hibiscus is just a symbol to Saeng telling her that It will be @CAPS2.K, and that it�s okay for her to miss Vietnam but also that it�s okay to have a new life, So Saeng, in the spring, will go take her drivers test again with a new attitude and will pass the test.	2	2		2																					
3127	4	The author used that paragraph in order to create imagry. The author wants you to get an image of the story. She also used that paragraph to express her emotions.	0	0		0																					
3128	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph to tell you when Saeng was going to take the test again also ,to reunite with the plant again. This is a conclusion paragraph that gives insight on what will happen in the future that�s also why the author added this paragraph in.	0	0		0																					
3129	4	The author ends the story with �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� to show a comparison. Since the plant reminds her of home, when it buds she will be more confident to take the test. When she was looking at the petals of the flower it said, �Gently she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least she could hold on to.� This shows that she really missed her home, and she had nothing to give her confidence. The flower is the piece of confidence she needs to feel at home and even pass her drivers test. Saeng felt out of place in her new environment. The flower hibiscus, gave her motivation. It gave her a chance to connect with a part from her old home, in her new home. Saeng thinks, �And that rich sweet scent- that was familiar too�. This shows that this flower was a sentimental importance, she needed. Therefore, the author ended with that paragraph to show a comparison and the importance of the flower to her adapting.  	3	3		3																					
3130	4	"In �Winter Hibiscus,� Minfong Ho ends the story how she does to show a sign of hope. Saeng is going to start over when the world starts over. Spring is the time when animals come out of their winter holes, when trees blossom, and when the snow melts. It is a time of renewed. Saeng �Vowed silently to herself to try again in the spring time.Saeng parchases the hibiscus in remembrance of her homeland, but also to know when it is ready to come back out of the base to try again. The hibiscus does these actions by coming out of its buds and blooming. Ho ends her story in hope of a new beginning. Saeng vows, �Then I will take that test again.� In the word choice of �That test again� depicts her new attitude. She wants to try again, her test.     """	2	2		2																					
3131	4	to show how absent she feels without them by her. You see this when the @ORGANIZATION1 says �when they come back�. also when she says �the geese return & this hibiscus is budding�. Shows how she feel without them and how she will feel when they return and how she will carry on where they left off last time as shown when she says �, Then I will take that test again�.	1	1		1																					
3132	4	I think it  was  a  good  enough  by Minfong Ho.Through out the story you feel somewhat happy,and somewhat sad,but always calm.You  feel happy when they are talking about all the  plants and when   her mother accepts the plants when she bought. At first, when you think  the mom is  going to yell at   her for buying that,after she failed her test.You feel bad for her but still calm mood and show the girl want give up,but just take her time.	1	2		2																					
3133	4	"I @CAPS1 I @CAPS1 the author concludes the story with the paragraph saying that she�s going to take the test again, to show us that this time she�s goin to pass the test and she�s not going to feel the same way she felt when she didn�t pass. it tell us in �spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding"" because thats when she is going to take the test.

3134	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself and to her mother too. Saeng decided to tell her mother what she had done, �she failed the test� probably her mom get upset with her but then she talk to her again. Saeng  mather�s ask her about the plant that she have with her. Saeng said that she buy the plant by @MONEY1. She was sad because she failed the test and when she buy the plant it probalbly makes her feel better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it bring some kind of hope to her, and she probably will pass the test. When she said �then I will take that test again� @CAPS1 makes her to decide to take it agan it could be the plant.	2	1		2																					
3135	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author want to show the readers that Saeng will want to pass her driver licens test. The reason that so the reader show how detirmen Saeng do after the winter The example is that in the story Saeng fail her driver licens and was sad about. The next example is that when she find this flow she know she do it again. This show that the flower help her feel better show that she will do it again. The first example show that she was sad that she fail the test. At the conclusion the author put this statement in the story to show reader tat Saeng will pass the diver licenc test later on.	1	2		2

The rest of the story is and sad because saeng misses her home in Vietnam. ""Its � it�s not a real one. I mean, it�s not like the kind we had at � at � she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. Not like the ones we had before.""

He doesn't want to just leave us hanging with the girl watching the geese fly away into the distance. The girl felt very bad about failing the test which makes the reader feel sad. To cheer up the reader, he ended the story in this way. Saeng is reminded of home when ""the geese return and this hibiscus is budding,� So, the author ends the story having Saeng have a sense of renewed confidence and the reader feeling happy."	2	2		2																					
3138	4	The author concludes the story with that because she is determined to succeed in @LOCATION1. She misses her homeland and everything there: gardens, grandparents etc. For example , she walked into the flowershop she smells the flowers like she used to back home. She then smelled a flower that reminded her of her grandmothers �long gray hair, freshly washed �� But by saying that last sentence she said that when the hibiscus budded next winter she will take the test that she failed again.	1	2		2																					
3139	4	"The author concludes the story with ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silent ly to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again."" because the girl is willing to try again and to not give up no matter what.

The author is just showing that the girl is going to try again next time."	1	2		2																					
3140	4	The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with that paragraph because he wants to get across to the reader that that saeng will not give up. Saeng and her family moved from Vietnam, and it has been hard for her to adjust to changes. Saeng really misses her homeland and the flowers that she sees @CAPS1 life. She explains how the winter hibiscus is not the same as the one in Vietnam so she plants this @CAPS1 type of flower and decides to wait till the spring to take the driving test. This shows that saeng wants to plant her difficulties in @LOCATION2 and think of them again in the spring when the weather and atmosphere is nice. She is not siving up but she does not want to take the difficulties till a later time. That is why the author concluded with this paragraph. 	3	2		3																					
3141	4	I thank he uses it because she wants to get a nother one next year to see what its like to like something so much and get to look after it for a wial That is why I think the nararator use that phrase as his last one.	0	0		0																					
3142	4	The author concludes this story with the paragraph she did because it shows how Saeng is adapting with the change she is going through in @LOCATION1.the winter hibiscus helped her @CAPS1 with Failing her driving test, so Saeng figures it will give her luck when she takes it again. Also the hibiscus will survive, and while she works towards her goal it will develop more. Once the flower blooms, it will symbolize strength, helping Saeng over come this obstacle. Her mother said the flower was not as pretty but will survive. She means @LOCATION1 @MONTH1 not be as great as Vietnam, but Saeng will stay strong.	2	2		2																					
3143	4	The purpose for the ending the Author @CAPS1 is to show how the hibiscus gives Saeng A good sense of comfort, compared to how:- she was At the beginning of the story. It Was like she had very little confidence. And now she is forced to call this strange place home, And that emptied her @CAPS2 to strive until she see�s A very familiar face that brings back her memories of when She was the happiest. Having something Around that was special to her Around All the time can make @CAPS3 feel At home or like it use to be, she found her confort in the Hibiscus. So now that it rests in her garden to constantly grow through All the seasons, She will to with that reminder of her old home and how good it felt, except now with new memories.	2	3		3																					
3144	4	@PERSON1 go to the top and then over the hill.	0	0		0																					
3145	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, �Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,� This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, �Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,� she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person.	2	2		2																					
3146	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he or she feels like the audience should know what saeng is feeling. This paragraph ending shows that saeng will keep trying every spring to grow back her flowers and this shows that Saeng has a lot of potential to make her vowe top herself successful.	1	1		1																					
3147	4	This story is all about overcoming hardships and disappointments as well as accepting and adapting to the things life throws at people, so it is appropriate that the story is ended with a goal and a determined attitude. Throughout the atire reading, Saeng sought comfort in the things most familiar to her, such as flower and the taste of bitter melon. She was hurting and disappointed, and those things were the only things that gave her peace. It was those things that save her the courage she needed to retake her driver�s test in the spring, so it seems fitting that she end the story with the mention of the hibiscus. The end paragraph also shows that Saeng is adapting well to her new country. She says, �when they come back... in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return...� At first the sounds of geese were alien to her, but now she has accepted their honking as a normal sound. This implies that she is learning to accept her new country, which is the perfect way to end the story.	0	0		0																					
3148	4	The author concludes the story this way because in the winter time she wai�t be able to see the hibiscus .she is used to  going outside in the garden and seeing her beautiful plant In conclusion the author concludes the story that way, because in the winter time she wai�t see  her plant.  	0	0		0																					
3149	4	In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again.	2	1		2																					
3150	4	The author concludes the story with that like, to leave the reader guessing. The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve. The author was trying to show how she can change, and grow just like her plant.	2	2		2																					
3151	4	The author used the concludes with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She wrights that because when her flower starts budding she will be able to take the test cause she is like a flower. The author uses the concludes because when the flower is going to budd and the geese come back she will think that she is back home. Thats why I think the author used the conclusion �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.	1	1		1																					
3152	4	In winter hibiscus the teenager girl Saeng fails her driver�s test, and then runs into a winter hibiscus and comes in touch with her memories. The author concludes the story with re-trying the test when the geese return and hibiscus buds to show comfort & familiarity. When the speaker says �almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� This example shows that she had lost touch with the realness of nature and that was what was going to get her to pass the test. The author sets an impatient mood for  the reader because it took her for winter to discover this, and winter is when its too late,  the geese have left and the flower has closed, so when spring comes they�ll be open to new opportunities and so will she with the familarity around her. 	3	2		3																					
3153	4	I think she concluded with this statement because she doesn�t know if she will pass but she isn�t giving up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she feels bad and the plant helped to cheer her up so when she sees the plant next year she wants to take the test.The plant is like a sign of good luck. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it leaves you with the idea not to give up when times are hard keep trying.  	1	1		1																					
3154	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. One of the reason is so the reader could imagein what rest of the story would be like if it continued. For example when the author said �then I will take that test again.� Another reason is to give the reader one last good image to change their thought of the story. For example when the author said �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�. Those were reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3155	4	The author concludes the story like this because when the snow is melting and the plant is buding and the geese come back then she will take the test again. This is a way for her to realy think when she is going to do this again. When they come back, so will she, to take the test over again.	1	1		1																					
3156	4	In the story Saeng vowed silently to herself, �When the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. For some reason I think that is affine idea Saeng vowed.	0	0		0																					
3157	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� probably chose to end the story that way because then it�s ending with a sense of hope. Also, it is showing how Saeng is adapting to her surroundings much like the winter hibiscus. In the second last paragraph, Saeng hears the hanks of the geese and it is noted that their sound has become familiar to her through the course of the time Saeng probably vowed to retake the test when the geese returned because the time would allow her to grow and adapt even more. The hibiscus will be budding then, a sign that it overcame its obstacles and was successful in adopting. If the hibiscus could adapt, Saeng could too. She could look to the plant for inspiration. This feeling of hope in Saeng and her future is left in the last paragraph, which is why the story ends there.	2	3		3																					
3158	4	The author concludes this paragraph to the story because, seasons change, plant don�t most likely grow during winter time. So you learn a lesson and take it as it is and a wait until the next time you learn basically the same lesson, when the right time comes.	1	1		1																					
3159	4	I think that in the story �Winter Hibiscus� was a good story and also the author added the paragraph at the end because the main idea was like to work hard and that is why it mentions at the way end �I will take the test again� so you don�t fall and stay down you work hard and get back up and try again.	1	1		1																					
3160	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph so he can tell the overall meaning of the story. Also, the author concludes this paragraph because it is probably a moral to the story and gives you pointes or some events in the story you din�t know about.	0	0		0																					
3161	4	The story is somewhat sad. The girl misses her homeland. She is also sad because she failed her driving test. The author I think ends the story with the girl saying she will take the test again, to show that even though she is sad about her country and failing she is not going to give up. Failing a test especially a driving test stinks. Your very excited to get it but then you don�t. So the author is trying to show that despite the girls sadness she will not give up. The girl is going to keep trying until she finally passes. Also the author probably wanted to leave on a more positive note you usually don�t want to leave a story sad with no solution. So she said she would try the test again. There were many reasons why the author ended the way she did but above are the more obvious.	2	2		2																					
3162	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the story ends with that phrase to show that Saeng has goals. First, she wants to adapt to the new this new land. This is because she says that when they come back in the spring, which means she wont give up and try to adapt to her new life. This also says she has precision, she will continue to try to get her license because she says, ""when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" She says that she will try again. Also, it exploits that she will get the courage to keep on trying and not give up."	2	2		2																					
3163	4	Saeng was waiting for spring then she could take the test again. I think at se was wereing about it doing spring because she whent to wacth the geese fly in a u shape and she whent to see the plant grow but the snow don�t melt yet. She started takeing to herself about it but she could whant to take at test doing spring. At if she can passed it again because she doesn�t like to take the test over and over again. When every body gets to the diffent thing after thee test is over.	1	1		1																					
3164	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the main character Saeng who moved to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam with her family, just came home from failing her driver�s test. To Saeng her failing the driver�s test shows that she is unable to adapt to her families new lifestyle. Therefore she feels that she disappointed her mother and herself. On her way home she bought a flaver that her family also had back in Vietnam to try and comfort her mother. As her mother begins to plant the flower, a winter Hibiscus, she feels that her mother has forgiven her for failing the drivers test. Then she realized that she has adapted to her surroundings just like she believes her flower will and that motivates her to promise to take the drivers test again in the spring. By ending the story with Saeng�s promise Minfong, the author, made sure that the last thing which is the most important thing for the reader to remember about the story is that Saeng didn�t give up. She promised herself that she will try again and adapt to her surroundings not like others around her have adapted. Her promise shows courage and perserverance.     	3	2		3																					
3165	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she is not giving up and she will take test agin and the stelent will grow agin in the @DATE1.	1	1		1																					
3166	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng is saying she is learning to adapt to this country. Earlier in the story she says that she failed the test, because she did not impress her mom. Saeng and her mom are used to ife in Vietnam, they trying to adapt. Saeng thought that the hibiscus she got Is just like the one she had at home. At the end she realizes if she just has faith everything will be @CAPS1 and it will be just like home. She says in the spring because by then her hibiscus will be fully growned and she will take the test again to see if the hibiscus is like the one her mother thought she would get. Saeng is learning to adapt to her new country of the United States.	2	2		2																					
3167	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the �test� again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng�s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she �failed the test�, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow.	3	3		3																					
3168	4	The girl is determend to win. She wen�t and took a test for a flower and she did not pass and she went back sad and emoshond she told her grandmother that these flowers are not like the ones at-at she cold not say at home because it took too much pain and her grandmother said they are not like the real wones.	1	1		1																					
3169	4	In this story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho , the author concludes the story with, �When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� In the beginning of the story that she was less confident and she failed the test.  But this one flower gave her hope and so next time she takes the test she�ll be better prepared. 	1	1		1																					
3170	4	The author would conclude the essay like he did because it sounded good to help he all the shangling ideas together. For example one person said, �she silently vowed to herself in the spring after the snow melts she would retake that test.   	0	0		0																					
3171	4	I think the author ended the story with that sentence because every winter all or most plants die off, and during the spring the would have to start all over in growing this plant.	0	0		0																					
3172	4	The authoR ends the STORY this way because their trying To show that Saeng will be dedicated To the hibiscus gardening and once she proves herself she will have passed the test. It also shows that she wants her heritage to be a major part of her life by growing their nations flower 	0	0		0																					
3173	4	"The author ends the story with this quote, because it shows how determined Saeng is to passing her driving test. For example, in the story, �Winter Hibiscus"", Saeng after she fails her driving test says something to forget about fating, and she said, �Let�s plant, right now�, she said this because she was trying to forget about her failing, and focus in something positive, In conclusion, this is why the author ends with this quote, and an example of how determined and focus Saeng is to passing her driving test.    "	1	1		1																					
3174	4	The author concluded the story the way they did because it left hope .Saeng hod been hurt anddissappointed but in the end she had shown hope in the story Saeng failedher driving test. She was very disappointed . In The endit  showed she was not going to quit in this new country . She was going to move on and make the best of what she has.	1	1		1																					
3175	4	I think that the author concludes with this paragraph bacuse she is determin to conpleat and pass the test. First reson way is that she faild this year and whants to pass next year. Next she is comparing the hibiscus to her passing and sulding on the test. That is way the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3176	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng is going to try keep her next plant. The reason why she says she is going to take the test again because she sold the plant to somebody. Saeng has seed the plant before as a child and that's why she was so attached to it. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will try and keep her next plant. 	1	1		1																					
3177	4	The author concludes the last paragraph to show that after a time period you can come back and try something again. Or maybe when weather change this can be different for Saeng. Maybe she is relating herself to the plant as to when it come to spring  the flower will be stronger, and she feel that she will pass the test second time around when the geese come back and the hibiscus is budding. And it also shows how she appriate the nature because if not, why would she wait until spring and when the snow is melting. The conclusion of the story is that she do like nature, because she talk about the hibiscus.	1	2		2																					
3178	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by: Minfong Ho, a girl named Saeng is try to adjust to @LOCATION1 coming from Vietnam. She is sad and misses her home, especially after failing her drivers test. She walks by a store and recognize a plant from her home. She buys it and takes it home in a pot. She says thinking of home and all the great memories she shared with a plant. Her mother then comes and shares the moment with her. Saeng feels better now. In the end sentence the author includes �saeng vowed silently to her herself, in the spring when the snows melt� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�(Ho, ??)  the flower has given her the conbidence to socceed and she wants to take the test again. This shows the connection she has with her home and the flowers. She wants to overcome her sadness and plan onward not leaving her memories behind but her pain.	2	2		2																					
3179	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� the author chose to conclude the story the way she did to show the comfort the hibiscus provided that allowed Saeng to move on. The greenhouse provided a place for her to get her feelings out about her home sickness, �and in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� Then when she went home she was faced with the reality again of how she failed the test. I think when she failed the test it brought out feelings of how she thinks she is failing to adjust her new home. But when the geese fly by the author brought the story to a conclusion to show how the experience has made Saeng grow. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again.� I think the author wanted to show that through the events in the story, she was able to overcome her feelings about a new home. 	2	3		3																					
3180	4	I think the author concluded the story with this statement because to me it sounds like it�s going to be a new start for her-self in the spring. She talks abouts how when the hibiscus starts budding, the snows, is gone and its spring that when she�ll retake the test. To me it seems like when the hibiscus �comes back to life��. Its having like a second chance and she desrves one also. When its bright out again and things start looking out again and things starts looking good she�ll feel good about taking the test over again. How she ended it to me was good. You just have to read into it and try to understand what she is actually saying. So practically she�s stating once everything �come back to life� then she�ll feel like she will pass it next time. Now she can be prepared.	2	3		3																					
3181	4	There are many reason why the author concludes the story with that paragraph . One reason is she likes hibiscus flower you can tell by when she again � When she got to the hibiscus , She  reached out and touch a petal gently .� Another reason is that they are pretty . You can tell by when she says  � It was like walking into another world  .�  Last reason is that she likes the present of them . You can tell by when she say � Huge flat leaves , delicate  wisps do tenant�s  , ferns , and fronds and virus of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion.  As you can see these are reasons why the author ended with that paragraph .	0	0		0																					
3182	4	"The author of this story was smart to end it by saying she will take the test again in the spring, when every thing bloms. This girl just  failed her driving test she dose not want to take it right away. The blomming of the hibiscus symbolizes her old life at her old home and it is also symbolizing a new start when it bloms. This will give her the confodence to pass her driving test and make he excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return�. This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and fells contible, at home you are contible. The author ended this story of this girl, Saeng, with hope and drive to do what she wants to do. That is why it was smart to end the story like they  ended it.  "	2	3		3																					
3183	4	The hibcus as the author has reveat to the audience is a beautiful flower who in the story is the memories of a young girl who has fail the test knowing she was to depress for her failing the test. The flower helps as a symbol of encourage to the sad girl in her most tragrant event and shows how a little flower gives comfort to the girl.The girl Saeng vowed to demonstrate that when she overcomes the sad memories. She�ll be able to be capable to prove she will pass, after she feels ok about the situation she is experiment with her destroy life after have to come to a different country where you mast have a @PERCENT1 of capacity and it�s logical that the adaptation of the girl is not going to be right away. In othe words, the author message it�s to motivate the people who has problems in their lifes and that life it�s not give up. Instead you should keep working hard until you get it. In conclusion working Hard and @CAPS1 give up it�s a part of our life and it�s up to our selves to overcome failing	2	2		2																					
3184	4	"In the Story the @CAPS1 concluds the story with the sentance ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think he ends it this way because she has accepted that she failed or lost but is willing to try again to accomplish her goal and ""take that test again"". Also she is making a promise, or a vow to her self and to not give up on her goal."	2	1		2																					
3185	4	The author concludes the story with he paragraph because they both go togather the away there both about things going and leaving the season changing. like they don�t won�t to let go but they knew there be back soon. Thats why the author combided the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3186	4	The author is expressing hope for the future in her concluding paragraph although just failing her drivers test and adjusting to a new atmoshere Saeng finds comfort in a Hibiscus. �it felt smooth an cool with a hint of velvet toward the center - just as she had known it would feel.� This expresses that the rememberence of �an old friend� was able to lift her spirits after a previous dissappoinment it was obvious Saeng was uncomfortable in her environment, which her mother noticed when she arrived at home. �she paused as she noticed the tear stains on her a daughter�s cheecks and her puffy eyes.� Her daughter was not adjusting to her new atmosphere and even though she had spent a lot of money on a single flower she understood. With all the negative attitude through out the story, once Saeng saw the geese and planted her �winter� hibiscus, she realized what was strange to her before had now become familiar. Saeng finally realizes with a memory of home, her goals can be accomplished and life can be stable somewhere other than home. She illustrates that from failurecomes success.	2	3		3																					
3187	4	The author concluded the story in the paragraph. She doesn�t want Saeng vows the whole room to herself where it�s quite when she is taking the test.	0	0		0																					
3188	4	She is  saying that ryt now, is not the right time to table the tst, she is saying that she is going to wait to care back until spring, when the flowrs we blooming to take the test, @CAPS1 she is so acentric abought the exotic flowers, She can�t stand to do it now, when the time isn�t right. So she is saying that she is going to wait until the time is right to take the test.	0	0		0																					
3189	4	Saeng will take the test in the spring when it�s not so cold. She likes it when the hibicus is budding they smell so good. They good smell reminders her of her native contrey. Saeng likes fried melon, it leaves a golden after taste on your tongue. She would poter it over a Big mac. 	1	1		1																					
3190	4	These are many reason why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3191	4	The author included that concluding paragraph because the hibiscus shows Saeng �comfort in her time of discomfort.� She would possibly feel more comfortable when the hibiscus is budding because she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of that she fail test the first time because she was comfortable with being in a new place. But when spring comes, she�ll be more confident and comfortable because the hibiscus is budding.	2	1		2																					
3192	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because earlier in the story, saeng was talking about how she failed the test, in which she wanted to retake. So, saeng declared that next year, when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding , she shall take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3193	4	"The reason why the author concludes this paragraph is to show saeng that she will be waiting for them to grow back and she will try again for her test. Hibiscus means a lot to her, and will keep trying because she doesnt want her mother disappointed in her again. Example of wher saeng felt shame ""her mother stared at her incredulously. But how could you?"" saeng wants to not down herself or her mother. ""saeng vowed silently to herself"" saying a promise that she will pass and respect nature as well as elders"	1	1		1																					
3194	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� by minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is buddling , then I will take the test again,� @CAPS1 author concludes the story in this way because it is somewhat of a cliffhanger. In the story, @CAPS2 is upset about failing her driving test and she has just moved from Vietnam to the united states and so she is a little homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up ??? reminding being alike the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng hasn�t given up and that she is going  to try and pass the drivers license test again. But what you don�t know is the end result of whether she passes or not and so it is a cliffhaofer. That is why the author ended the story in this way.	2	2		2																					
3195	4	Saeng has been the victim of a tragic  loss  in  family  and also  a move  to  a totally different  world. The paragraph  is  symbolic  of  turning over a new leaf and starting over.The �snows  melting� and �hibiscus bidding� are both symbolizing  new life.Saeng is going to have a outlook on life and accept  her situation to  make  the  best  of  it. Also, the  author say �the  winter  hibiscus  was  in the ground now� as  it does compare to saengs new found  outlook  planted on life. Like the flower, a seed of hope was planted into Saeng, and now she is ready to blossom.	2	2		2																					
3196	4	In the story, �winter hibiscus�, by @ORGANIZATION1, the author is very sentimental over the Hibiscus plant because it reminds he so much of her home. The reason why the author conclude the story with that saying was because it gave her a goal. She failed once at getting a job, but she @MONTH1 believe that the Hibiscus is good luck so she sets a goal on when to try for the job again. When she saw the plant, she remembered happy memories. In conclusion, certain things can trigger your memories, but its the good memories that make things in life something to wait and hope for.	1	1		1																					
3197	4	The author ends the story this way for a few reasons. First it shows that she is starting to like this new life. Also it is an ending that is open. It shows her liking her new life for a few reasons. �She realized that many of the things that she had thought strange before had become� almost familiar now� that is when she starts to see that her new life in the @LOCATION1 is not so bad. This is about the geese and is referred back to when she vows to take the test. Also it shows how the hibiscus she just planted is already important to her. The second thing it does is dreams about future conclusions. The reader does not know if she will pass the test next time but assumes that she will because of the way she vows it. That is why the author ends this story the way they did. To show how she feels in her new life and leave an opening for people to draw conclusions.	3	2		3																					
3198	4	I think that the author concludes the story she fails the driving test, so they added she was going to take it over. And maybe the plant is or would be good luck to her after the snow melts and the geese return it would be a fresh Start. Also it would be nice after she descovered the plant.	1	1		1																					
3199	4	The author concludes the paragraph with this paragraph because she wants to try again. The author is saying that the hibiscus she planted @DATE1 did not work and she is trying again this @DATE1 to grow a hibiscus plant. She will pass the test if she succeds in the spring. That is why the author concludes with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3200	4	He concludes that when it is spring he will take the test again. That will give her another chance to pass it. This will give her another chance to do what is right.	1	1		1																					
3201	4	She going to take the test agan @CAPS1 she feels like She needs to and She @CAPS2  when the snow melts and geese came back that means She wants to take the in the Spring. 	1	1		1																					
3202	4	"In �Winter Hibiscus� the author @CAPS1 sentence is �When they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"".. I think the rememberence of home will help her take the test. She use to the geese and plant to remind her of home and by having these surroundings makes her comfortable"	1	1		1																					
3203	4	In the same way the hibiscus flower prevails in the winter saeng wants to be the same way. Saeng failed a test which makes her feel unsuccessful. Saeng wants to prevail she wants to stick it out and the rough times she�s going through make it very difficult for her. When Saeng says �I � I failed the test� this shows that saeng feels disappointe that she didn�t  expect that because she is a fighter, So the author ends the passage with saeng saying� When they come back, in the spring, when snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� To show how much of a fighter Saeng is because she�s determined to strive under difficult conditions.	2	2		2																					
3204	4	The author puts this paragraph last because it shows that saeng is looking to a new lease almost on life. She now has something to take her through the year that is ahead of her she now wait till it is winter once again to see the hibiscus flower bloom once again and as wel as many more to come	1	1		1																					
3205	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I believe she concludes the story in this way to show that even though Saeng failed the test, she will try again someday, someday being symbolized by when the geese come back. Saeng is sad because she missis her homeland and she sees plants that bringback memories, so she buys a winter hibiscus to ease & comfort her & remind her of home.	1	1		1																					
3206	4	"The Author concudes this story with paragraph because She loves her garden. She concudes it because the story is about then and their garden and it eventually turns cold leaving them nothing to do untill Spring. Itsuggest they have strong feelings For what they do as it says ""in In spring when the snow nelts and the gese return and this hibiscus budding"" hears she wants to take the tst to overcome and prove She can take care of her Garden."	0	0		0																					
3207	4	At this time she vowed to retake a test cause of how the flowers will always come and go but her grades will be there only one time for her school work. Instead  she rather garden then do school work.	0	0		0																					
3208	4	The author  concludes the story with this paragraph because the winter hibiscus gave her some hope. Also , because her mother was understanding  about  her  failing the test. That is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph .	1	1		1																					
3209	4	The author concludes the story with optimism and hope for the future. She finishes her story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. By concluding the story in that way it helps demonstrate the hope the hibiscus plant brought to her after she failed her drivers test. The hibiscus the helped give Saeng one step closer to adapting to her new home. It says in the story Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of strange before, through the quit repition of season upon season, almost femiliar to her now.�  In the way the author ends the story it helps give inspiration for a new beginning and new season.	3	2		3																					
3210	4	In the story,  @ORGANIZATION1, by  Minfong   Ho, a  girl  named  Saeng  tries  to  adjust  to  a  new country, but it is nearly impossible. She is stressed about failing the driver�s test, country, but it is and she realizes that  nothing is  the same. Except for  one thing  that  she  quickly  recognized. A  plant called the �Winter Hibiscus.�It made her think of her old life in Vietnam. It helped her  set  through  hard  times  and she didn�t want to give up on anythings.This is exactly why Minfong Ho ends the  last paragraph  by stating  that Saeng  will retry  the driving test when the hibiscus is budding.The  flower gives her a thought of home   in  Vietnam, making her try and try again.Also,the author  ends the  story  like   this  to  state a  theme. This particular  theme  is,  �No matter  how hard something  might  be, you can get through it. You  just  have  to  find  a way that benefits you most.�	2	2		2																					
3211	4	The author comes back to that paragraph because in the story Saeng is so sorry she did not @CAPS1 the test. Now saeng wants to make up for it, She vowed to herself she will @CAPS1 that test. For example, when I say to herself I am going to get sumthin done I do what it takes to get it done and I don't give up when things get rough, @CAPS3, This last sentense is what the main idea of the story is, To make up that test and @CAPS1 it, To get done what needs to be done	1	1		1																					
3212	4	The reason why this author includes this story with this paragraph is because it is still talking about saeng and that is more like her and that she has a mind like a butterflye that was trapped a burst out with this open the Saeng and her mom had but a tennage girl me and saeng we kind relate to the same thing.	0	0		0																					
3213	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, I think the ending paragraph is there to show that Saeng has not given up. She says, �When they come back�then I will take that test again.� She is talking about the hibiscus and the geese. The things that remind her of home. When the reminders of home come and give her strength, she will have the power to take the test. This shows that even though she has failed she will not give up and she will try again. I think that is the purpose of the paragraph. To show Saeng hasn't given up.  	2	2		2																					
3214	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he is telling the reader that after the snow leaves the author will begin to plant more plants. The test is to make sure his plants don�t die during next @DATE1.	0	0		0																					
3215	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by @CAPS1 Ho. The author is stating that Saeng is happy when she is around the plant and she finds peace with the plant because it brings back childhood memories. For example �And that rich sweet scent, that was familiar ton.� She loved the way it made her feel. When one of the leaves fell off and she breathed in, it remined her of grandmother. @CAPS1 might of experienced something like this. @CAPS1 might of wrote this because the story could relate to other people who moved from another country and have something that brought back memories. Everytime that l touch or smell a sweater,it brings back memorises of my grandmother. I feel that he wrote this because of his personal experience and it could relate to others	1	2		2																					
3216	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how some some people vowed silently because the don�t want to express themselves. Also maybe because they are not very mistful of people even themself. One day I was  like that I didn�t want to talk to anybody. All I want to do is sit in my room and think. Think about my life were I am going to go after i die. I just woulnd sit in my room in the dark wondering if in my room in the dark wondering if I  would come back in another body or will my soul roam the earth. But think I starting think that I am a kid, I got a wonderful like a head of me. I when I get to the one where I need to think about then I would . So  I started talking to everybody again	0	0		0																					
3217	4	The author concludes this story by saying this statement because the author want you to feel like the character in the book is determined. The ator is trying to put across a statement saying  get through then try again. The character is not giving up, and she will get through the test eve though its hard.	1	1		1																					
3218	4	The author is talking about gardning and how she wants to get better at in the spring. She probably thinks shes bad at gardening because her mom is really good at it and she wants to be that good at gardening too.	0	0		0																					
3219	4	The reason why is so you get the feeling that Saeng feels about gardening. She is praying for spring to come so she can do it over again. She like to watch plants grow and become something that you can eat. That is way the Author concluded the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3220	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show determination and hope. The geese and the  hibiscus symbolize saeng�s determination, because they always come back no matter what. Saeng will be back to take the test , just like the geese will also be back. The hibiscus also symbolize her because it has faced adversity also. It has been taken to new paces and had new homes, much like saeng , and has a harsh winter coming in the near future.  However , it  always  finds a way to come back and bloom in the spring, which is what saeng hopes to do by taking the driver�s test. The author included the last paragraph to show symbolism between saeng  ,the  geese , and the hibiscus.That is why the author concludes the story with that paragraph.    	3	3		3																					
3221	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he basicly trying to say that everything happens for a reason, and that reason might mean through seasons. She @MONTH1 think that she would have better on her test in the spring only for the simply fact that everything blooms in the spring.	1	1		1																					
3222	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that she can go through these obstacles even though she moved from her home land. Also it shows that she has more confidence thats why the author concluded her story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3223	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in th spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph is that what happens to his life that he will take the test again. But in the story it talks about. One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it So I think that they take care of there garden and try to make it live in the winter. So thats what I think about the last paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring. when the snows melt and the geese return and his hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.�	1	1		1																					
3224	4	"The author concludes the story with this because that one paragraph basically sums the whole story up. ""When the snow melts and the geese return"" basically goes back to the beginning of the story when saeng started planting. This is why the author gave the story ends conclusion."	0	0		0																					
3225	4	The auther concludes the story with this paragraph for a few reasons. first, The test is important to Saeng so that she can prove to herself that she is able to pass it. Ending with this paragraph also gives the reader some suspense as to wheather Saeng will pass or even go to take the test again. Lastly, this paragraph shows Saeng�s personality traits. It shows that she is persistent, determined, and strong willed.	2	1		2																					
3226	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" at the end of the story the author writes ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again."" The reason why the author said that Is because she Is trying to tell the readers to get right back up and do it again, If you fell once there Is no harm and trying again. When its spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promise to take the drive's test. After failing a driver test Saeng buys a flower at a florIst that remInded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and put it in the garden. Told her mother that she fail, Saeng's mother was very understand and told her maybe next time In conclusion the author �write the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life.  "	1	2		2																					
3227	4	The author concludes the story that way so she can keep everyone wondering. I belive she ended that way to let us know that she will be back and when she comes back she will be ready for everything including that test. She left us wondering because when she does come back she is going to want use to Read about what happened when she came back and what happened when she @CAPS1 the test. She only made that vowe to herself nobody else because if she did she would have let them down if she failed. That is why she concludes the story that way.	2	3		3																					
3228	4	The author ends the story with this because she is saying she will be around next year to take the test again. She is saying how she wants to be around when the plants grow. She mostly wants to see the hibiscus grow. Because she appreciates and likes nature so much she wants to be around again to see them grow.	0	0		0																					
3229	4	The author concludes the story with this final paragraph to show how sentimental and important the plant is to Saeng. She will take that test again when the winter is over because it's too cold for nice hibiscus to survive. You need a winter hibiscus. �Not like the kind we had before �(@NUM1). This shows how important it is that she finds a hibiscus like the ones she had at home. She shows dissapointment in herself until that last paragraph when she shows courage and strong will.	1	1		1																					
3230	4	"When they  come back, Saeng vowed to silently herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and  this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concluded this story in such a way that it makes the reader ask questions much live in the �@CAPS1�s @ORGANIZATION1� when there was a modernist way to interprentle means of a sty by makeing the reader ask questions instead of that beig a moral to the story. For example in the �@CAPS1�s @ORGANIZATION1"" the main character @PERSON1 run away and all are could get as a slaming door. Much live in this story there is a twist in that what test is the main character talking about? Is she goig to try to move ww friends? is this live a resolution she is making to herself? also this leaves the reader wanting more of the story so that they @MONTH1 go back and even read it again."	1	1		1																					
3231	4	The �Winter Hibiscus� is a realativly sad, but hopeful story that uses lots of symbols. The author concluded the story with a confident ending that makes the reader feel satisfied. The two reasons he wrote this conclusion paragraph is to give the ending a hopeful tone and relate the objects she sees to the spring. �Winter Hibiscus� ends with a hopeful tone thanks to the confident vow Saeng silently makes. She had a rough day, and the author wanted to make sure she had something to look as a goal. It also reveals how strong of a person Saeng is. The author uses this conclusion paragraph to leave the reader with a hopeful and confident tone. The second reason the author concluded with that conclusion paragraph was to relate some of the objects she sees to the spring. The geese represent the new place she is living in, and the hibiscus represents her old home. This paragraph links these two symbols together, so the reader can relate them to the spring. The way the author concluded the story was brillantly done. It represents a hopeful tone, and symbols that relate to spring. It ends confidently, and leaves the reader satisfied.  	2	3		3																					
3232	4	I think author concludes the with this paragraph because she wants to not give up. For example, he wants to show  us never give up at anything even if you fail. Therefore, that�s why he ends like that.	1	1		1																					
3233	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted to get her point across. also because she wanted to create an under standing of the complexitier of the passage. The author wanted the reader to feel her message as if they were there to witness it.	0	0		0																					
3234	4	"The author concluded the story with the sentence, because the author wanted to show that since Saeng found the flower she has new hope and reason for passing the test. The flower gave her inspiration because it made her look back on her home in Vietnam �I mean, not like the kind we had at-at"" She found that she was still too shakey to say the words at home""When Saeng brought the plant to her new home and planted it in the garden it was like bringing a little piece of Vietnam home which made her feel better. The over all inspiration and the memories the flower had for Saeng made her feel better about her new home and feel better about her new home and gave her a reson to start fresh with her driving test."	2	2		2																					
3235	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is saying that when the flowers come back in the spring, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding after winter, she will garden them again.	0	0		0																					
3236	4	The author of �winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with �when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.�Saeng, because it creates the mood that Saeng is accepting the changes. Just like nature adapts to climate and location change, saeng seems to appreciate her situation and is deciding her situation and is deciding to make it a positive instead of a negative. The author is showing that if your having trouble, try again; through the main character, Saeng.	2	2		2																					
3237	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph for alot of different reasons. One reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she might try it again. A second reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably wanted to try to make her mother proud. A third reason why the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph is because she probably really felt that she really disappointed herself. In conclusion, if you mess up on something, try again maybe you will do alot better.     	1	1		1																					
3238	4	Minfong Ho concluded �Winter Hibiscus� with the lines �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� to show that there is always hope for better things to come. Saeng had become sad because she remembered her home in Vietnam. She longed for her natural home and familiarity. Her missed memories agonizingly hurt Saeng because she was now for away and in a different world. However, the author started to reveal hints that @ORGANIZATION1 would accept @LOCATION2 and find come childhood memories there too. �Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and �yes- familiar to Saeng now.� Already, Saeng was growing familiar with her surrounding area in @LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would keep her @CAPS1 culture, tradition, and memories alive, as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in @LOCATION2. As one kept her @CAPS1 and �@CAPS3 culture alive through memories, she would continue a successful life and pass her test. That is why Minfong Ho ended �Winter Hibiscus� with the particular paragraph.	3	2		3																					
3239	4	The author concludes the story in winter hibiscus, Kind of funny/ weird like . The concluding sentence is �when they come back saeng vowed silently to herself in the  spring, when  the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. I know one thing the part of the title is in the concluding sentence, so it is basically it is concluding the whole  story, plus the characters	0	0		0																					
3240	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that the narrator is ready. The narrator tried the test once and failed. She bought herself a flower to cheer herself up. Her mother talked to her and then she felt better. She felt determined to pass the driving test just like the flower was determined to survive.	2	2		2																					
3241	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it symbolizes the change in Saeng as well as other things. The snow always melts when the seasons change. The geese always come back when the seasons change. The hibiscus will bud when the seasons change. Saeng will try again when the seasons change. But she�ll be a different person also. Knowing that everything will change but stay the same on the inside, Saeng decides she will too. She has more of an appreciation for @CAPS1 now after seeing the hibiscus and remembering her past.	1	2		2																					
3242	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author shows that Saeng will take the test again and that she will be ready and she will pass the test. Also, the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that it ends the story knowing that she will take the test over again, so she knows she has faith to take the test again and make her mother proud that she passed. This is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph	1	1		1																					
3243	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring it�s warmer and more fun plus she will have time to study her stuff in winter for the spring time. Also because like she says in the story it goes along with the conclusion at the end that she finally understood what was going out so she connected it to the way the geese are.	0	0		0																					
3244	4	The author concude the story with that paragraph because its what she solemely promoted herself.	0	0		0																					
3245	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author�s purpose in concluding the story with �When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,� was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. �Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.� This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, �How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. �This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months�. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal.	3	3		3																					
3246	4	"The author concluded the story with ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. Saeng believes that if the hibiscus can survive through hard times and adapt to changes, and survive she can also. Saeng icoms that even though she has moved to the United States and it is different she is strong enough to survive. Failing her drivers test dosent mean that she is incapable of anything, but trying again with a fresh start like the hibiscus."	2	2		2																					
3247	4	The author concludes the story with this @CAPS1 the author wants to show Saeng hasn�t given up. Easly in the story Saeng goes to the green house and starts to cry. When she gets home she says to her mother, �I-I failed the test.� @CAPS1 of this Saeng wanted to go back and try again. That is why the author ended with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3248	4	The last paragraph was added in order to represent the determinedness and adapting to new things in Saeng and her family. In the beginning, Saeng held bitterness at failing the test. But after she remembers her homeland through the flower she accepts it. Just as the flower will bud, she will be a new person and thus pass the test. An example of her being determined to deal with it is that she does make friends, and, though the food she offered was rejected she didn�t give in. The moment of breakdown was as she got the flower. After she got home it was over with and again she accepts the change.	2	1		2																					
3249	4	The author include the last paragraph because Saeng is not going to give up. and she will try again. I think Saeng bought the flower because she had them at her home land and it will help her. For example Saeng started to cry because she miss her homeland.	1	1		1																					
3250	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he things when the flowers come back they would be batter. I think the he thinks that it would be a better test next time	1	1		1																					
3251	4	The author concludes �Winter Hibiscus� with the paragraph because it continues the theme of adjusting to changes in life. In the story, Saeng has come to the United States from Vietnam and it is quite a change. Also changed are the plants. The hibiscus reminds Saeng of Vietnam, but it is different. The mother in the story says, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold winter months here, this winter hibiscus. �The hibiscus also relates to the theme because it is able to adjust to changes. The final paragraph talks about snow melting, geese returning and the hibiscus budding. These are all changes the author uses to connect to the theme. This adds more understanding to the story�s message. Additionally, the tone of the last paragraph is hopeful, which gives the reader a positive feeling. The tone adds to the theme of the story.	2	3		3																					
3252	4	The story is about he failing the test. She says she will try next year when the geese come back.	1	1		1																					
3253	4	I think he means thas seasons change and that winter will come again. I think that is the test. 	0	0		0																					
3254	4	I thinks that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that she is similar to the hibiscus and geese. First, the geese and hibiscus both have a goal, which is to survive the winters. Geese fly south for the winter to stay warm. This is similar to Saeng worse thing both moved to a different environment where they must adapt. Also, Saeng must experience winter along with the hibiscus. The hibiscus needs tobe strong, to overcome winter, from this, it shows Saeng is like her hibiscus because she needs to be strong to overcome the test. If her hibiscus can overcome it�s test, winter then she can survive to cangner her own.	2	3		3																					
3255	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� includes �when they come back in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again because it shows that she can adapt to change and still can think about her old country too. An example of how she can keep her old country alive in her life is� But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much perferred it to a Big Mac.� This shows that she can still eat the foods she ate back at her old home and try new things at her new home. In conclusion the excerpt shows that the author can put both cultures together and be happy.	2	2		2																					
3256	4	There could be many reasons why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. There could be many different meanings of this paragraph that could have importance to the story. I think that the author includes this to say that when the spring comes, she will have many more reasons to take the driving test. You can break this paragraph down to mean many different things. I interpreted it to mean that when the spring comes back, she will have a new beginning. The snow melting away represents all the hardship she faced in the previous year. The geese returning and the hibiscus budding means that they are also coming back to start the new year. They are too coming back, getting ready to start their new life. It is included at the end to show how Saeng is trying to forget about how she failed the test. She is using this time now to prepare for the next time she is going to take the driving test. She thinks that once she forgets all of the bad things she went through the previous year. She had to move on and be able to pass the driving test the next time around. The author concluded the story with the paragraph to show how Saeng plans to solve her problems. The way you interpret the paragraph gives you different ideas about what it is trying to say. I think that it is showing @CAPS1 new beginning that she will have to go through the next year. 	2	3		3																					
3257	4	I think the author concludes the story with the phase �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� I there saying that they will be ready for them the next time they come back.	0	0		0																					
3258	4	The author ended the story �Winter Hibiscus� with Saeng vowing to retake the test. He ended it this way to show the themes of this story. One theme of the story is to never give up. The winter Hibiscus has to last through the long winter but it does survive, and it inspires Saeng to keep trying. Another theme is to overcome your obstacles. The flower faces many dangers, but still manages to blossom. Saeng wants to overcome her obstacles and pass the test. Therefore the ending of the story displays the themes.	2	1		2																					
3259	4	The author concludes this part, because it made the story stand out a little. For example when Saeng said that she ment when the plants came back. It also gave the ending a little something to hang on two, rather than staping on talking about the v or geese to get the reader off topic. Last she also ment when the geese came back.	0	0		0																					
3260	4	I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see�s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack.	1	1		1																					
3261	4	I think the author ended the story with that phrase to show that she wont give up; no matter how hard it is she keeps trying. The girl says in the story �I failed the test,� and then at the end of the story says I will take that test again so she is not willing to fail forever. I also think the author ended the story with that paragraph to make you wonder if she will ever pass the test.	1	1		1																					
3262	4	I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasn�t ready for before but now whenever the geese return and the hibiscus return the she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasn�t mentally prepared. So inconclusion I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return the she will take the test and maybe she wasn�t physicaly and mentally prepared for it. 	1	1		1																					
3263	4	Authors chose their closing paragraphs carefully. The author chose to end their story with this paragraph because all of the stuff the actor has in the last paragraph represents something special in the characters eyes. There are resons the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph. The authors chose of the ending paragraph is very important. The character says �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. The hibiscus that she mentions represents the ability to overcome obsticles. In the story it is talking about the girl overcoming the failed test and retaking it. That is why the author concludes with that. The author also writes. �when the snow melts and the geese return� This to the character represents new beginings and chances. That gives the character the sense that next time around she will pass the test. The author adds that paragraph in the end to symbolize new beginnings and chances and the ability to over come obsticles. Authors choose their last paragraph for specific reasons. This author did as well. The author did it to symbolize things.	2	2		2																					
3264	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of a saying that when its cold and silent she�s hot to her self but when the snow  melts and spring is here. She�s said  and does lots of fun things.	0	0		0																					
3265	4	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph because the geese that flew down south in a beautiful @CAPS1 formation, fly down every season. So she tells herself, @CAPS2, she will take the test again when the geese return and the hibiscus plant is budding. For example, she thinks to herself, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� @CAPS2, looking up at the geese she is almost reminded of an experience she went through somewhat similar.	1	1		1																					
3266	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again to emphasize that you can overcome a defeat or failure by waiting until the ""season"" come again for you to re-endure. Basically, the hibiscus(a plant) meant much to the narrator and her mother which was dying and they dug up a hole to help it to grow, so when it grows again that proves that it will be living better. So when Saeng relates the test that will be her her having the opportunity to past the test. The story with this paragraph symbolizing a new beginning about to take place. This actually means a situation that will came again that will help you to get what is needed out of it that you missed. The story and the paragraph emphasizes what life is about to budling a cycle."	3	2		3																					
3267	4	She can�t wait till the flowers start to come back when the snow melts so it isn�t very cold out so they grow and she is going to take her test that she has failed when the geese and flowers come back.	1	1		1																					
3268	4	The author concludes with this paragraph to show that Saeng, like the geese and the hibiscus, will return again and have hope. Saeng is a little depressed in the story because she is in a new country, and just failed her driving test. The hibiscus plant in the florist shop brings back painful emotional memories for her, but at the same time, s very comforting. Later in the story, she plants the hibiscus outside in the garden with her mother. As her mother goes inside, Saeng watches the geese fly overhead. �Almost reluctantly, (Saeng) realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her. Like the geese.� Saeng knew the geese would return in the spring, just like she would to her driving test. The hibiscus would be in bloom again too to provide her with hope. This is what the final paragraph in the story �winter hibiscus� means.	3	2		3																					
3269	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng�s everlasting determination. This idea of her determination to succeed can be connected to the plant she brings home. The plant she knew grew wild where she used to live, but she found it potted in the United States which is limiting its growth, just like saeng�s new country seems unordinary, and she feels out ofplace.	1	2		2																					
3270	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng telling herself she�ll take the test again because it draws together the overall theme and major actions of the story. The theme of the story is that you can get used to a new environment by finding beauty in it and similarities to your old home. Saeng says that �many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repitition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now like the geese.� And when she�s in the greenhouse the plants draw her back into memories of Vietnam and her grandmother. Saeng was having a hard time adjusting to new things after moving to @LOCATION2, but she was determined to overcome the difficulties just like she had overcome the differences between the @LOCATION3 and Vietnam. I think the author concluded the story by talking about the geese and the hibiscus and re.taking the test because it demonstrates all the ways that Saeng is adjusting to her new life and shows her and the reader that she can overcome new things. She vows to herself that she can do it, and fereshadows her future and sucess and adaptation to an @CAPS1 lifestyle.  	3	3		3																					
3271	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph that she did because it was the end and the start of a new beggining. The author uses the sensens in her story. The winter is the current season and spring is on its way. Although Saeng failed her test in the winter when most things die, she is looking forward to spring to start again on her test. The geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life. Saeng will also have new life in her test to pass it this time and drive. The spring season will come and new life will be provided to all.   	2	2		2																					
3272	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is like say most of the story but in a small and shorter way.	0	0		0																					
3273	4	This paragraph is a good way to end the story because it relates to the test. The narrator says she will try again in the spring. 	1	1		1																					
3274	4	I believe that the author  concludes the story with this paragraph because it's what the story is all about it just exploins what happened in the end as if what happeed through the story was the growth and living of a flower.	0	0		0																					
3275	4	"The story  �Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho. The author concludes the story in a what seems like incomplete paragraph. The girl Saeng vows to take her driver test over when the spring comes. when Saeng was holding the plant, she felt cold and halpless like how the plant did. ""Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, it's leaves quivering in the wind."" By Saeng's mother reassuring her that she was okay with her choice it made Saeng grow as a person, ""I'm glad you got it."" @CAPS1 mother also says, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing."" That in a way describes Saeng clinging to stay connected with her country. Saeng�s mother also tells her of now the plant will surely survive. When the spring comes the plant will be just as strong, and so will Saeng. Which is why the author leaves off where she did"	1	3		2																					
3276	4	The author concludes the story by showing the girl�s connection to the plant and the symbolism of the geese, the �Winter hibiscus� is her connection to her homeland. She said she�ll retake her driving test when her plant buds and is brave, so she will do the same. The geese flying south show her journey as a person because she will take the test when the geese come back from their journey, as she comes back from hers.	2	2		2																					
3277	4	The author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. All throughout the story there was depresing nogistalistic tone that made the reader yearn for the past. The author wanted to put on emphisis on being strong even though you @MONTH1 not enjoy where you are at. Also the author wanted to show the strength of the main of the main character Saeng. Even though she has just failed a test in a new, strange world she still wishes to continue pushing foward. This adds more demension the the character and makes her less static and more dynamic. This is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward.	2	2		2																					
3278	4	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to get some roots in the new soil she is on. When she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time.	2	1		2																					
3279	4	I believe the author concludes the that passage in the story to show patintions. Saeng was to wait for spring maybe it will feel like her home town again. She likes the spring better than the winter. She likes the birds the geese return in sping. They go away in winter. That way I believe the author concludes that passage.	1	1		1																					
3280	4	�when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author has left her home and moved to another country. She is now in an unfamilar place. Everything that now surrounds her is new and mostly un-known. By ending the story with this quote, it suggest that the author still has hope of adapting to her new home. When she left her home, she did not just leave a building behind. She left her home, people she loved, and an endless list of memories. At times she @MONTH1 have felt out of place because she was no longer in her comfort zone. She is now �out of the box,� and in a whole new world. When she saw the hibiscus, the exotic plant took her back to her memories and to the love of her old home. Then she came back to reality and broke apart with sadness and �failed her test.� The ending sentence shows that the author is willing to try to survive in this new place and that she is still determined to pass her own test of adapting.  	3	2		3																					
3281	4	"The author concludes as the story with the paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself., in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" mean that she will take the test and hoped she pass so she could make her mother happy and support her. She chosee spring because spling is the rebirth of nature and Saeng would like to retake the test with a clear and clean mind. I think that the reason why the author choose to put the paragraph in the end of the story. "	1	1		1																					
3282	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for several significant reasons. Throughout the story Saeng struggles with her past and overcoming it. The paragraph helps bring a sense of closure to the story. When Saeng returns home with the hibiscus she tells her mother she couldn�t help it and was unable to overcome her past. Saeng said, �I-I failed the test.� When she says �the test� she means the ability to cope with the loss of her grandmother and homeland, and overcome it. In the concluding paragraph Saeng says she will retake the test. She said, �When the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� In conclusion, the author uses the concluding paragraph to bring closure to the story and the emotional obstacles Saeng faces.	2	2		2																					
3283	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to end the story with hope. For example, since she has move to the United States, she feels homesick. To make it worst, she failed the driver�s test. �She found she was still to shaky to say the words at home, lest the burst into tears again. �This quote helps add to the homesick girl. She concludes with this paragraph to show that when spring comes, she�ll start out fresh and re-live her life in @LOCATION2.	2	2		2																					
3284	4	The author concluded this story with the paragraph because, Saeng is explaing to the reader�s that she will take the test again when the time is right. When things seem to be getting better she will retake the test. That is why the authour used that paragraph to conclude her story.	1	1		1																					
3285	4	"In the story Winter Hibiscus written by @CAPS1 Ho. The narrarator goes to a greenhouse that has many flowers but one in perticular catches her eye. A ''winter'' Hibiscus plant. This plant reminds her of her homeland and everything that used to take place there this plant also reminds her of  her grandmother's long silkly gray hair and how she used to watch her dry it in the sun and then she would help her knot it up into a ton with a bud of this plant in it. The author ends the story with this because it counters her statement when she say ""I-I failed the test."" and the end of this passage  says  ""..., then I will take the test again""."	1	2		2																					
3286	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the girl Saeng @CAPS1 the drivers test ""I-I failed the test"" said Saeng. She had bought a hibiscus because the flower remined her of some of the memories from home and the hibiscus she had at herhouse. at the end she says that she will retake the test when the geese come back, the snow has melted and the hibiscus is budding. She does this I think because she needs time to just think things through to just remember back home and to make a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is just like Saeng. They both did something wrong or @CAPS1 something Saeng failed the test and the hibiscus was constrited to a pot. But they both are going to change the bad thing.."	1	2		2																					
3287	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the paragraph in that way to convey the determination and new found motivation Saeng found by buying the familiar plant. Although she failed her test, finding a plant that reminded her of her home and her grandmother instilled motivation in her to try the test again, she wanted to make her new home in a new country workout for the better, no matter what. �She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive u was etched against the evening sky ...� the author included details about the geese to represent moving on. The geese will go, and come back, just like Saeng. She failed the test the first time, but getting the plant and seeing the birds motivated her to try again. �Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become ...familiar to her.� The geese were one of the things mentioned that has become very familiar to her, in her new home. Concluding the stay with a bit about the geese conveys to the reader that she is slowly but surely learning how to adapt to her strange new home. Finding the plant helped her, because it was already familiar to her. �Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral. �@CAPS1, Saeng said.� �After failing her driver�s test, walking into the florist�s shop and finding that plant comforted her. It made this new place feel closer to home than it did at first. The geese had become familiar over time, and finding the plant was simply comforting. Concluding the story that way showed the reader that she was adapting and learning to deal with a tough situation in a comforting way.  	3	3		3																					
3288	4	"In the story ""WiNter Hibiscus"" by MiNFOnG HO the author concludes the story with ""when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the sprinG, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is buddiNG, then I will take that test again"". The author concluded the story with that @CAPS1 because she is sayinG that when the year starts OFF @CAPS2 and starts over, that she will too. She's sayinG that when the Geese @CAPS3 back, the snow melts, and the Hibiscus starts to bud that they all start over and start a @CAPS2 beGiNNiNG. So when she Goes to take the test it will be a @CAPS2 year."	1	2		2																					
3289	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus ended her story with words regarding to the story @CAPS1 failed her driving test. Saeng cried when noticing her past through flower. As well as bought dok malik seeds show that the story ended the way it did, because next season	1	1		1																					
3290	4	 The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up.	1	1		1																					
3291	4	The author used that sentence because the snow is melting and the geese are coming back. The flowers were budding up and that is why I think the author used that sentence. Scribed by @ORGANIZATION1	0	0		0																					
3292	4	"I believe that this was a good ending to the story. When Saeng says �When they come back� she is talking about the flowers. When the come back alive. �In the spring� shows when the flower will come back. �When the snows melt and the geese return� she is saying that after winter (when the snows melts) and when the geese return(in spring). �And this Hibiscus is budding� She is saying when the flowers blume again in the spring. � Then I will take the test again,"" she is saying after all this happens she will retake the test (in the spring). This shows that Saeng will be watching at all these things happening and count down till spring again, so she can retake the test. She is ready for spring to be here, so that she can study and pass the test, and work at the flower @CAPS1. This will be her goal for the winter, till spring comes!"	1	2		2																					
3293	4	The author concluded the story with that ending because in the spring when everything blossoms. And she wouldnt be focused while there is snow. So when the hibiscus is budding, thats when she will be able to take her test again. I think he wrote that because it means something to her.	1	0		1																					
3294	4	This conclusion of the story provides a sense of hope for the future. The girl is upset that she failed the test but still has hope for what will happen next. In the story the narrator says, �She lifted her head.� This quote is showing that she is not going to quit and give up, but that she will try until she succeeds. The conclusion of the story leaves readers to wonder if she will try harder and pass the test for the second time. When she says, �when the snow melts and the geese return,� this shows us that she is like the geese because their both going back for a hand fought journey. Also, when she says, �and this hibiscus budding� she is saying when everything comes to life and is at it�s highest peak she will take the test because she will have the most confidence. The author concludes the story to show that there is hope for the future and that she is not going to give up. Although she is upset about failing the test she will certainly be ready to pass it in the spring.	2	3		3																					
3295	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of reasons.	0	0		0																					
3296	4	Saeng is @CAPS1 that it Will be a longtime before she will worn about school work again. thats Why the author concluds the story with their paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3297	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because he wants the emphasize that the girl is not completly dissatisified with leaving her home. He ended with that because he wanted to she that their is hope for her to learn to love her new home.	1	1		1																					
3298	4	The author ends the story with this sentence because Saeng needs a break before she takes the test again. Saeng is comparing to indifferent things; Flowers & taking a test. That is significant. Thats why the author ends the story with this sentence.	1	1		1																					
3299	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show that the girl is going to be like the hibiscus. The next time it blooms the girl will be ready for the test and will take it again and will pass. The authour  wants to show that the girl will not give up and will try again to make sure she passes. The author involves the hibiscus to show that the girl and the will bloom the same time the hibiscus will and will pass the test.	1	2		2																					
3300	4	Well, I think the author concludes the story with that sentence because maybe Saeng likes the spring and can concentrate better with her favorite flower that she thinks relates to her life.	1	1		1																					
3301	4	"The author ends the story like that to show the theme working hard, Some other examples of working hard are the �winter hibiscus."" Another example is her vow to pass the test, so that is why the author ends the story that way."	1	1		1																					
3302	4	The author concludes the story with they paragraph that they did because it's about the same thing that they opened the story with.  To introduce the story, the author tells about Saeng failing her drivers test, and then seeing a familiar plant that she wants to buy. The middle of the story is about how she is having a hard time adapting to her new home. So to conclude the story, the author puts that Saeng will take her drivers test again, once the flowers starts budding, and the geese come out. The flower and the geese remind her of home, so this tells you that thinking of her home, and the objects that make her feel at home, comfort her, and help her overcome obstacles.	2	2		2																					
3303	4	Authors use many techniques to improve their stories. Without these tequniques a story @MONTH1 seem bland average or unattractive. Author Minfong Ho canverys the fact that Saeng will try to take the test again. Instead of simply stating the fact that she will retake the test, he has her make a promise on the geese that she will. The Author ended the story like this show how strongly she felt about the test.	0	0		0																					
3304	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it connects the hibiscus back to the trials and triumphs of saeng . Just how saeng can�t give up .and must go back to retake the test, the winter hibiscus must make it through the hard, rough winter and come back strong . The hibiscus are a symbol of hope and saeng thinks of them as her hope. Throughout the story, the hibiscus are comforting to saeng because they remind her of home. The author includes this because many people can relate to this and find hope in things.  For saeng, knowing that each year the hibiscus will come back in those conditions, reassures her that she�ll be okay there as well.	2	2		2																					
3305	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show a new beginning. The geese are comming back to restart their life there, the hibiscus will be blooming, and she will re-take the test. At the beggining Saeng was depressed about having to leave her old country and grandmother. Saeng began to feel �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her�. She remembered how some of these plants grew wild in bushes or between cracks in the sidewalk. Saeng saying what she did in the last paragraph is her. showing that she found comfort and confidence in the hibiscus. Memories of the past showed her the way and now she is going to retake her drivers test.	2	2		2																					
3306	4	I think the author concludes this story wit this ending paragraph because the story is all about how  she feels comforted in the plants and she wants to wait until the weather breaks and the geese to come back to take her test. I think she wants to wait that way she will be more comfortable with her surroundings and she can clear her mind and do her best on the test.	1	1		1																					
3307	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows Saeng wants to take the test again, but she wants to take the test again when everything else good and happy returns like the plant and the geese. This is true because Saeng says ""When they (geese) come back� and this hibiscus is budding I will take the test."" This shows her maturity and happiness and happiness. She wants to do something hard and maybe even not fun when everything else returns and is happy. Just as when she came, she was sad, but when the geese and plant comes back she wants to help them through this and make them happy too. This way they all can be happy at the same time."	1	1		1																					
3308	4	The short story �Winter Hibiscus� as written by author Minfong Ho, ends with main character Saeng, promising herself that in the spring when the geese return and the winter hibiscus begins to bud, that she would re-take her failed drivers test. Mingfong Ho, writes this story, with heavy imagery and symbolism, the hibiscus found in the floral shop, represents a connection for Saeng to her homeland, and the bittermellon, which is loved by Saeng, but unbearable to people in @LOCATION1 ,represents Saeng�s hard time connecting to people in @LOCATION1. And for Saeng, the budding hibiscus, and returning geese, are representative of a new opportunity to pass her drivers test, and better adapt to life in @LOCATION1.	3	3		3																					
3309	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because she wanted to show that Saeng doesn�t give up and that nature gives @CAPS1 strength. The conclusion shows that Saeng doesn�t give up by saying that she is going to take the test again, even though she failed it earlier that day. Also, it shows that nature gives Saeng strength by saying that Saeng will take the test again when the geese return, when hibiscus buds and when the snow melts in spring nature gives her strength because it reminds her of where they used to live and her grandmother. In conclusion, the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng is not a quitter, and that nature gives her strength and confidence.	2	2		2																					
3310	4	The character, Saeng, experiences both internal and external conflicts. Saeng had failed her driver�s test and stilled missed Vietnam. The ending of the story was an excellent choice of conclusion for the story. The flock of @CAPS1 geese represented her changes. She used to foot awkward and out of places. Many things were new to her. Saeng realized that life isn't so bad for her. The planting of the �winter hibiscus� represented her change as well. It showed how she will start new and continue happily. Saeng will �plant a new seed.� The ending was well chosen for the story because it foreshadows Saeng�s future. The story is inspiring and the ending greatly contributes to the effect.	2	2		2																					
3311	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show how Saeng relates the hibiscus overcoming of problems to her own overcoming of problems. Saeng is comparing the hibiscus to herself. If the hibiscus can adapt to its surroundings, then so can she. And if the hibiscus makes it through the winter, then she too can make it; and she will re-take the test that she failed before. Also, before this she says that things that were once strange to her now seemed familiar, like the geese. She then see�s them overhead flying in a V. They are also adapting to their surroundings by flying to a warmer place, and Saeng too can adapt.	2	2		2																					
3312	4	The author Concludes the story with that sentence, because She is excited for spring to come back So she can plant more things and watch them bloom, and come alive.	0	0		0																					
3313	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph, because it shows Saeng will not give up. Saeng failed her drivers test and as she was walking home she found a hibiscus. It reminder her of her old home. Saeng goes to the green house or flowershop and buys one. When she returns she plants the hibiscus. The hibiscus is keeping her from giving up. When it starts budding, @PERSON1 will take the test again.	2	1		2																					
3314	4	"The author chose that paragraph to put at the end because that is when everything will be perfect to redo her mistake. Saeng said crying ""I-I failed the test!"" @CAPS1 means she failed at what she thought she was good at. �Here let me help mother"" getting up and taking the shovel away from her mother. Saeng is trying to get better at gardening so when she does redo her mistake she will do better. As the reader can see Saeng wants to pass the test, so she can believe sh is a great gardener like her mother."	0	0		0																					
3315	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because It makes people want to read the next story to see How she close on a the test. In the story she failed the test now that she changed she wants to retake the test because she knows she can do @PERSON1 now than before.	1	1		1																					
3316	4	Cause every thing that is in this paragraph is in the story somewere. So it really intwines to gether. She learns to adapt to her new home land as dose the plant.  	1	1		1																					
3317	4	I would say that the author concluded this story ently paragraph because they wanted to be very consist. They wanted the reader to have a very good example and understanding of the text. In brief words.	0	0		0																					
3318	4	The reason why they include the story with the paragraph is because they talk about the same thing. Then they probably included the story with the paragraph might have been to show the good relationship between the mother and daughter and how they can do things together. Then in the story they talk about going to Canada together.	0	0		0																					
3319	4	The author decides to conclude the story with this paragraph to show the strength and confidence Saeng has. By saying she would try to pass the test again in the spring is showing she is confident and is looking for a new beginning to come then. Also he concludes it this way because after she failed the test she didn�t have much self-confidence. And once she spoke to her mother and knew she was understanding, Saeng knew she had to try again and perservire until she passed the test.	2	1		2																					
3320	4	I  think  when  she  take  the  test  over  it  is going  to  be  in  the  spring  and  She  is  going  to  try  and  pass  it .  But  she  did  not  want  to  cry  in  front of her  mother  . I  think  she  is   going  to  make  it  up  to  her  and  pass  the  test.	1	1		1																					
3321	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to show the readers she was knocked down but she is going to get back up again and take the test again. This is also a very good way to end the story because it shows she is very determined to pass that test and won�t give up and will do anything to pass it.	1	1		1																					
3322	4	The reason the author concludes the story with that paragraph is because he is showing that she will not give up and she will do it when she is ready to. The reason I say this is because she is doing the test when she wants to, when she feels comfortable. Those are the reasons I belive that the author ended the story with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3323	4	"I believe the author concludes the story like this to show an example of perserverance. Saeng states, �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now."" This statement represents adjusting to change. Soon she will adjust fully to her new home, it just takes time. If she keeps perservering. she will make it. In the last paragraph Saeng says, �when the snows melt, and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" Just as the season's bring things back, she will come back. I believe this last paragraph was put in to show everyone should perservere because things just take time."	2	1		2																					
3324	4	"This statement shows what the author concludes about the story. It shows the theme of the story really. It you fail, then try again. This is what the statement is saying, she failed her tasks so in the spring once the hibiscus blooms again, she will attempt to complete her task. The statement also concludes how you should never gave up. Saeng had failed the test. She said,""I-I failed the test"". This shows how sad and depressed she was because, the tone the statement was said in was a sadder more depressed tone. Even though sad depressed Saeng knows that next year she will attempt to complete the test. Overall, the sentence shows what the author concludes and think about the story �Winter Hibiscus�.  "	1	2		2																					
3325	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� for several reasons, @CAPS1, Saeng decides that she is determined to pass her driving test just like the hibiscus. Saeng�s mother says that it is �strong enough to make it through,� and Saeng decides to be strong like the hibiscus and make it through and pass the test. Next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to @LOCATION1 because the geese �sound familiar.� As much as she misses her old home, she is adapting. Finally, one can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, that as much as she misses her old home, she�s starting to get used to her new country and she recognizes that she ispart of it. She knows that letting her past get in the way of her will not help her pass the test and, like the plant and the geese, she will return again.	3	3		3																					
3326	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver�s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. 	1	1		1																					
3327	4	I think the author ended the story like that because she enjoys to see the geese and she loves the spring and wants to take the test and pass. Sh is studying for it in the mean time.	1	1		1																					
3328	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do.	1	1		1																					
3329	4	The author is very creative. He concludes the story saying how the hibiscus is building and that she will take the test agian. She believes that she will do better when the snow is gone. The author ended the story with that because Saeng was very upset failing a test but with the comfort of the hibiscus she�ll be able to do better. He also concludes the story with that paragraph because the climax was when she failed her test and somehow the author had to conclude what was going to happen to Saeng  with the test	1	1		1																					
3330	4	He concludes the story like thot because the test was the main thing thot he was talking about.	0	0		0																					
3331	4	"In the end of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho, the narrator describes her desire to take and this time pass the driver's test she failed earlier in the day, she ""vowed silently to herself"" that she would succeed at something she had failed at in the past. This is an important concluding message, because it shows that the author will overcome obstacles in her future. Most of the story is about the sadness that the narrator experiences because of longing for her homeland, Saeng misses her grandmother and the plants of Vietnam, and she even buys a hibiscus plant to remind her of her homeland. She is also not enjoying @LOCATION2, because she has already experienced failure at her new home. However, the end of the story provides contrast do this, for Saeng vows to succeed in the future.       "	2	3		3																					
3332	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown. She has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too. nature�s fight for survival is like Saeng�s struggle in a new place. She discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time. Then after that time it will feel just like home. The adaption principle is shown throughout this story demonstrate by nature or a child�s life it�s there. Therefore the author would agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng.	3	2		3																					
3333	4	In the story , �Winter Hibiscus�, Saeng is new to @LOCATION1. She is missing home when she sees a hibiscus in a flower shop. After she takes the flower home and plants it in her backyard, she decides the next time she�ll take the drivers test is when the Hibiscus is budding in the spring. The author concludes the story this way because it relates Saeng to the flower. Saeng feels out of place in @LOCATION1 because the hibiscus is a connection to her old home in Vietnam, the ending symbolizes that if the flower can make it through the cold winter, she can too. She will take her drivers test as a sign of surviving and overcoming obstacles. In this story it has a overall theme that everything will get better with time. Saeng will adapt to the differences of @LOCATION1, the hibiscus will bloom; and Saeng will pass her drivers test.	3	3		3																					
3334	4	They ended it because the girl is not going to give up. She is going to keep trying at this test and wont stop at it eaither. And she will be alittle brighter. She will also pass this test. And this way she wont disappoint her mother. And she will be able to get this test of of her sholders.	1	1		1																					
3335	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph inorder to help the reader visualize a new beginning for the girl. A time to re-take the test and have the fresh new flowers to look upon. To watch the geese return. The geese are symbolic to her and the quest she had taken.. to her new home. The combination of the melting snow and the budding flowers lets the reader know of the bright fresh unclaimed future that is to come for the girl. The author uses the paragraph at the end inorder to explain more of what is to come, to enhance illustrations and capture the attentive audience. It is used to show a spirit in the girl. that allows us to see that she is like the flower, she is having trouble rooting/grasping on to the new lifestyle but there is always going to be a fresh/new time to continue on.	3	3		3																					
3336	4	I think the author puts that paragraph in the story because maybe because its a good luck thing or its a tradition so its very important that its in the story. Also it could be trying to tell us something like she only take test in the spring when the hibiscus starts budding.	0	0		0																					
3337	4	"In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author conclude the story with that special paragraph in order to mutul Saeng�s game for wanting to be home but also to show that she is learning to overcome obstacles. Saeng wishes that she way in her homeland, and keeps up reffiring to it because she wants it back. �I mean, it�s not like the one we had at-at-,� Saeng continues to stumble because she doesn�t wish to mention home because it brought her to tears. In addition, were she mentions the �test�, it makes to her buyin a fake test.�It�s - it�s not a real one�. She refuses to buy a real one because it reminds her of the driving test and how sad she already is. The test reffs to both the plant and the driver�s test. Saeng also ends with this vow because the flower represent hope to her, ""... and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test�. The emotions test of both of the situations she is is will allow her to be stronger. This vow at the end of the story shows her willing up to be strong and come through in the end."	3	3		3																					
3338	4	In the story the author concludes that after shes done her test and there's nothing that to see she'll grow more.	0	0		0																					
3339	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph she did because the girl did not pass the driving test. And she adds all of them details of nature in there because she takes time to care about nature. That is what it is mainly about in the story.	1	1		1																					
3340	4	I am guessing the author adds this paragraph to tell the reader that when all of the beauty returns, she will try to get used to new thing again.	0	0		0																					
3341	4	The author of Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with that paragraph because it gives a sense of starting over and a new beginning for Saeng. The hibiscus is a reminder of her home country and it keeps her going and strong and she compares herself to the geese saying that things she thought were strange became familiar through a quiet repetition from season to season. In the winter the hibiscus doesn�t bloom and Saeng fails her driver�s test. That paragraph tells that in the spring when the Hibiscus thrives and the geese return it will be a fresh start for them and Saeng as well.   	2	2		2																					
3342	4	The author most likely ends the story with Saeng vowing to take the test again, because he wants to show Saeng�s determination. For example, when she tells her mother that she failed the test her mother knew that it was hard for Saeng. Since it was a silent moment, her mother realized that yelling at her about the plant wasn�t a good idea. Saeng is kindof comparing herself to the plant. she @MONTH1 have thought, if this plant can make it through the winter and still keep growing, than she can make it through the test. Therefore, that is most likely why the author ended the story the way he did.	1	2		2																					
3343	4	The author concludes  the story with this paragraph  because she has new hope and determination. The author loves and admires the hibiscus; for e xample �But it�s strong enough to make it through winter�, says her mother. Saeng wants to be able to deal with hardships just as strongly as the hibiscus can. She is filled with new resolution when she says to herself �Then i will take the test again.�     	2	2		2																					
3344	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the whole story was leading to it and the story  would have been pointless if it wasnt conclusion.	0	0		0																					
3345	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is going to adapt to the conditions of her new life. The hibiscus is a plant that thrives in warm, tropical climates. However it does not survive in the cold; only the winter hibiscus, which can survive in both climates (warm and cold) can. The hibiscus symbolizes Saeng. She lived in Vietnam and loved it with all the pretty flowers and being with her grandmother. However now that she is living in the United States, she is finding it hard to adapt. Now that she has this hibiscus flower, which adapts to the cold weather magnificently, she can adjust to her new life in the United States. When she sees the geese come back for another spring and summers, she will take the driving test because they are giving her area another chance of being their home for the season. This is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	3	3		3																					
3346	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the paragraph is about how the snow melts and the greenery returns, like a rebirth. This similizes his renew motivation to take the test again. This really shows how close he is to nature and the affect that his exposure to it has had on him over the years.	1	1		1																					
3347	4	I think that the author concluded the story with this paragraph because this whole story was sweet and left a beautiful picture in your head with like about every sentence. So why not end it in paragraph like, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Now tell that wasn�t beautiful.	0	0		0																					
3348	4	Then author put the last sentence the way it did. It mean't by that next spring they want to see how they react different of the same. They know what it is like but they know how to react to the season.	0	0		0																					
3349	4	He uses this line at the end of the story cause it shows she has anothe chance to pass the test. They use the plant cause a plant will always come back and bud again. This was also a good way to end the story because it shows now in the present plants @MONTH1 be a sign of inspiration and would teach you to look up to something. And maybe this is how she comunicotes with her mother through the plants.	1	2		2																					
3350	4	In the story winter Hibiscus they end the story with that paragaph, because it repents that she is geting use to the new contrury. She is also telling you that you need to a paped to newsra winds. That�s why I think they ened with that pargraph	1	1		1																					
3351	4	The flowers on this bush are very comforting to Saeng. In the story she explains that they remind her of her home in Vietnam. The budding of plant and spring represent new life. Saeng thinks that spring could also have a new beginning for her. That in spring, she will do better and pass the test. But, if she falls again, the flowers will have bloomed to comfort her.	2	2		2																					
3352	4	The author concludes with that because she kind of relates herself to the flowers. She has grown to her environment like a flower. Also she had failed her test, so just like when a flower dies and then comes back, she is going to come back and try the test again.	2	1		2																					
3353	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because she failed the test so over the winter they don�t get hibiscus but over the spring when they get again the hibiscus she will try to take the taste again so she can pass it	1	1		1																					
3354	4	The author concludes this as the last paragraph because of Two main reasons. One of them is the flower is almost like her in the being, the flower wasn't bloomed. But when the snow melts and the flower blooms she is like the flower and is going to try again to bloom out in passing the test Another reason is because it reminders her of bock home and her mother understands why she paid so much for it so they want to take core of it.	1	1		1																					
3355	4	Minfong Ho, the author of �  Winter Hibiscus � concluded the story with Saeng vowing to herself that she will retake and pass her drivers test in the spring when the geese fly back and plant rebuds. The author concluded the story with this paragraph   to signify Saeng�s   willingness to start over. After failing a test, Saeng visits a green house and misses her old home, Vietnam. She buys a hibiscus and plants it when she comes home after noting the geese flying south for the   Winter. The plant signifies her memories. When she first sees it, it�s blossomed. In the spring it will rebud  and form another blossom while growing bigger. This parallels Saeng   getting over her sadness and homesickness and rebuilding   better memories while growing stronger. When she gets  the chance. The birds flying  overhead are headed south for the winter for shelter from the cold. In spring they will return to start over raise goslings, rebuild their home, start over from last spring. Saeng is planning to start over, and pass it so she can drive and feel more accepted in @LOCATION2. Minfong   Ho, chose to end the story with a paragraph to signify the character�s starting over and rebuilding good memories.	3	3		3																					
3356	4	The last paragraph in, ��Winter Hibiscus,�� was add because the author want to show that she feels bad because she did not pass the test. She feels disapointed because her mom is disapointed in her and knows she can pass it. While she stares at the Hibiscus then the geese flying in the air, she thinks that she does have a chance in passing the test. Now that she is determined to take the test, she is going to take it at the same time in the next year and she believes she is going to pass it.    	2	1		2																					
3357	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that�s how the girl feel. She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did.	1	1		1																					
3358	4	It means that she want to do it all over again. It the girl comfort zone - So that is what she does when she upset. That is what the story and the phase mean.	0	0		0																					
3359	4	"The author concluded ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" to tell the reader never give up and to keep trying. It also tells us that family is always there because you can't do it on your own. ""It's a beautiful plant, this dok faeng- noi"", she finally said"	1	1		1																					
3360	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because the authore is trying to show the reader that she realized cares about the nature and loves It so because she is waiting for the spring and as soon as the spring comes she will take the test again. So in my opinion the author wants to show the readers that the character in story cares a lot about the natures baety.	1	1		1																					
3361	4	The author concludes the story with the sentence saying �when they come back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then i will take the test again� because the hibiscus is not as a good luck charm, when it�s not there things aint right but when it comes back thing�s then out for the better. Also the author concludes this because the good luck charm the hibiscus gave more confidence and when say it real confident one will succeed. Last one not story this let�s the reader know that she believes in something that gives her hope and that will make her so well	2	1		2																					
3362	4	The author concludes the story that way because one theme is to overcome obstacles. The hibiscus represents Saeng�s perseverence, and the last paragraph offers closure to the conflict that was introduced. The hibiscus is �strong enough to make ith through the cold months here� that is what matters,� this makes a connection between the plant and the author�s perseverence because of the symbolism. The last paragraph adds that symbolism with closure because she says she�ll wait until spring to take the test again.   	3	2		3																					
3363	4	Saeng is trying to say that when the time comes again that she will take the test. The author concludes the story with this because it leaves you wondering about what will happen the next time she takes the test. The auther also does this to show that you should never quit like if the flower can survive winter then she will be able to survive that test. Also the author is saying that when the seasons change, things change. She was going to give up because she failed the test but she seen that plant surviving through the harsh weathers and that gave her more confidence. Also she cherished the plant because she wants to see it budding because her and her mother spent quality time dve to this plant she had.	2	1		2																					
3364	4	Saeng is talking about her school work and the garden. She always connects the two of them in the same way. she knows that she has to study while the garden grows and she wants to water  the flowers and she is saying that when the spring comes she wont be there for the garden and she will have to take the test.	0	0		0																					
3365	4	The author ended the story that way to show that Saeng won�t give up and is determined to complete her task. The author wants the reader to understand Saeng�s very sad and wants to overcome being homesick. Saeng is very much like the hibiscus plant, she�s frail and beautiful. Saeng says she will do her test again when the hibiscus is budding, almost like she�s growing along with the plant. 	2	1		2																					
3366	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that everything and everyone can make it through a tough time. This paragraph acts as a final positive message to readers. The text say, �when they come back... I will take that test again�. This quote shows that Saeng can see herself as one of the geese or the budding hibiscus plants. She knows that her �winter� is her test and that when she is ready, she�ll be able to take the test again and be successful. The budding of the hibiscus represents the time when she�ll be prepared to take the test. Though she is having a tough tine now, she'll be able to get through it and make another attempt. This paragraph is at the end because it brings together the purpose of the hibiscus. Without saying this, the readers would have never gotten this message, instead, they would believe that the role of the hibiscus was to serve as a connection to Saeng�s past. In conclusion, this positive paragraph was included to show readers that everyone can balance back from a bad situation.	3	3		3																					
3367	4	One it could mean she can only take the test in the spring. But also because her surroundings during that period relaxed heR. When she was dissapointed and @CAPS1 about her driving failing grade.	1	1		1																					
3368	4	The author concludes the story with this @CAPS1 because she really cared the hibiscus. She said this because she was comparing her test to the hibiscus. When the hibiscus will budding she will take the test again. Hibiscus is everything far her. it is her good luck. And with hibiscus budding she can make her new life. withaut the hibiscus plant she was laser �I-I failed the test� and �I baught it,� saeng answered reading her mother�s next questian.� She was so depressed with her test failing that why she baught hibiscus to influence her life. she decided when it will spring with hibiscus budding she will start her new life by giving the test again and providing her self how important hibiscus	1	2		2																					
3369	4	The author is concluding that anything can happen in the story. Saeng planted a winter hibiscus and her mother was getting mad at her. Saeng�s mother was mad because she spent money on the whole plant instead of planting it and then it would be a lot cheaper. When her mother was mad and in disbelief, Saeng started crying and the mother forgave her for her actions. This shows that anything can happen	1	1		1																					
3370	4	The author most likely concludes the story with that paragraph because they are trying to show the reader that even though you fail at something, you can�t be stubborn. So Saeng failed her drivers test but in the spring when the hibiscus plant starts to bud she will go back and take the test again. By the plant budding she thinks of that as a sign that she will pass the test	1	1		1																					
3371	4	The Author concludes the story with Saeng saying a vow silently to herself to show the reader that she will grow like the hibiscus plant and take the test again, this time determined to pass it. The plant gives Saeng hope because it reminds her of the homeland that she loved so much. When the hibiscus starts budding and gaining beautiful flowers, Saeng will �bud� too and gain her license.	1	1		1																					
3372	4	I think that the passage is trying to say the sum because in the passage. it says �in the spring when the snows melt and only the sun does that and the gees return hunting season and the hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again�.  so @CAPS1 start in the spring so it has to be the sun in the spring time.	0	0		0																					
3373	4	" The author used the paragraph telling about how saeng would test in the spring at the end of the story because,the words used and the way it is read can tell the reader that saeng is at peace and accepts the fact that she lives in the u.s. When Saeng says,�and this hibiscus plant is budding,"" she is thinking about how the plant reminds her of her native country. Also when she says, ""Then I will take this test again� she is promising herself that she will take the test when she feels at home in her new country. Saeng also is in a way telling herself that she should accept the fact that she has moved and that she can still be reminded of her native country with the new hibiscus plant and many other things."	2	2		2																					
3374	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph for a very good reason. The author could write a sequel to this one. She could want the people to keep coming back for more, or wants people to know when things start up again so will Saeng. Ending the story with that paragraph is a very good thing to do. The author wants you to know when the plant and geese restarts their lives Saeng will do the same. She will not give up but instead re-take the test. The author could be planning to write a sequel to this short story. It leaves you thinking so then the sequel will be about the start of Saeng�s new life and what she plans to do to keep her vow. When everything starts to come alive in the spring so will Saeng. The author @MONTH1 love having people wonder about whats coming next. The people will go home and wonder what will the author do next with Saeng. The author loves keeping people in suspense and waiting for an answer.	2	2		2																					
3375	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the willingness of Saeng to overcome the obstacles and adapt to her new life. The hibiscus discussed in the ending quote describes Saeng�s new hope and determination to succeed in the United States. For example in the text it states,""� its fine petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.� When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to the together her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents newhope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually succeed. In addition, in the text it says, �it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.� Saeng�s past memones could be reached when this hibiscus was in new and that served as immense inspiration to her. The author ended the story with Saeng�s new recollection and hope to prove that she had indeed found something helpful and stable in a new world."	3	3		3																					
3376	4	The author concluded the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to portray to her reader that even though Saeng was experiencing a hardship leaving her old home behind, she could still find a good life with new beginning here. In the final paragraph the winter shows represent hard times in the past, while the spring represents a more optimistic future, and a new beginning. Although Saeng was grieving at the lass of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story she once knew hibiscus cran her did home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home. Also, the story says.� Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This quote leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can appreciate happly live in this new home. The final paragraph says,�.. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.� When things familiar to her and things their remind her of her old home come back, Saeng will have the strength to try to accomplish good things for this new life in a new home again.	3	3		3																					
3377	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it shows that you can allways start clean you should never give up when you realy want something. The daniter realy wanted to pass the test so she worked hard but she failed it. She knows like the plant spring will offer a new braining in life and you can always change something you dont like about yourself. I stongly agree with this statement because if you didn�t have a secound chance most people would all be losers because everyone makes mistakes, in there like and everyone has the over thniky to fix them. This is why I belive the author concludes this statement of the end of the story.	2	2		2																					
3378	4	The story ands with that paragraph because Saeng believes next spring when her new hibiscus is born she will have good luck to pass her driving test. It is a good way to end the story because the hibiscus was not involved in her life before she took the drivers test. Now she beleives that on her next driving test she will have the connection to her past experiences, ability to overcome obstacles, and comfort in a time of disappointment. Which Saeng thinks can help her pass the test.	2	1		2																					
3379	4	The author could have had many reasons to conclude the story with this paragraph. One reason @MONTH1 be to explain how she has changed in the story. Toward the beginning of the story the author sounds discouraged and upset that she failed her test. In her final paragraph it shows she overcame her fear. Also, the geese move like she did. �Saeng and her family have moved to the United States, but the geese feel odd moving too but they come back every year. Along with the flower Saeng is unique in her new life and must learn to adapt as the geese and flower do. She knows that the flower will bud and the geese will return in the spring and that is what she must do. She won�t give up but try again later on in the year. This shows how she is adapting and changing to work with her new surrondings.	3	2		3																					
3380	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the passage with this paragraph to demonstrate Saeng�s determination to not only pass her driving test, but to accomidate to her new home. The author says �vowed� to express positive connotation in the paragraph. The author says, �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become� familiar.� The author says this to show that she is adapting to her new lifestyle , yet he uses the last paragraph to say that she needs a little more time.	2	2		2																					
3381	4	In the story, �winter Hibiscus saeng made a promise to herself that she would never fail the test again Saeng wanted to remember her past and homeland. That is why she bought the flowers. At the end of the story she vows,� In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. She says this because she wants to move on now and try to get used to her new home.	2	1		2																					
3382	4	The author had the story end with the paragraph because all the ideas are brought together and to show that Saeng is ready for whats ahead. When they put in the flower they are concluding the flowers importance and how it relates to how the girl feels being happy or sad. Yet when she says that she vowed... and shed take the test again she saying that she is ready for whats ahead but will be open minded to whats new so that she can see were she�s gone from. Therefore the author ends with that paragraph to leave mystry for what happend and to conclude.	2	2		2																					
3383	4	The author concludes the story with this because its winter now + the flowers are gone, but during that time when she was planting she grew more mature. like it says in the text things she used to think were strange are now becoming firmiliar + shes getting the hang of things. Because shes learning more about it + will be ready for the test next spring. 	1	2		2																					
3384	4	The author uses this as an ending paragraph in the story because the next year at the same time she will take the test of life over again.	0	0		0																					
3385	4	The ending of a story helps determine the meaning of the story. It is the final closure and will most likely be remembered by the reader. In the end of the story Winter Hibiscus the author ends it with a paragraph of encouragement. The conclusion encourages you to keep trying, because it states that next year when the flower blooms Saeng will re-take the test. This shows encouragement because has the drive to try again and to pass. The author ends with the feeling of encouragement because it leaves the reader inspired. Her conclusion is strong and also seems to recap the stories meaning because all along Saeng keeps getting disapointed about the flower, her mother, and homeland encourage her to move on and try again. The ending used was meaningful and showed what the author was truly trying to convey	2	1		2																					
3386	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the main character is troubled because they moved away from home and the culture, customs and even food are different .Therefore, the main character has difficulty adapting to her new environment. The author concludes the ending statement to show that she will not stop trying to achieve her goal. She wants to take the test again change to see if over time things @MONTH1 have changed. The story is very emotional and expresses a great deal of sorrow that is overcome in the end.	2	2		2																					
3387	4	The author concluded the story with that specific paragraph about geese to show that Saeng is going to try to overcome her obstacles. She was @CAPS1 disappointed in failing the test so she took comfort in memories of her homeland. She bought a hibiscus that she saw in her homeland a lot, and that flower @CAPS2 comfort and affection. But it also @CAPS2 her ability to come over obstacles, and while she was planting her hibiscus, and saw the geese flying above, she knew she had to try again.	2	1		2																					
3388	4	The author  says this because she will try to start her own garden. Her other garden didn�t turn out to well. In the book it says she needed her moms help. 	0	0		0																					
3389	4	The author concludes the paragraph when Saeng realizes she can miss her old home, but she needs to adapt to the new place that she is in. Saeng misses the old memories of her homeland �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.� But, she begins to realize that not everything has changed, same things are still familiar. �overhead, a flock of canada geese flew by, the faint honrs clears and �yes- familiar to Saeng now.� When Saeng realizes that not everything has changed she gained the strength to continue her new life in her new country.	2	2		2																					
3390	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it was a good way to end the story off. At the end of this they was talkin about how saeng would come back when the snow melt and then she will take the test again.	0	0		0																					
3391	4	"When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding; then I will take that test again. The author concludes this story Winter Hibiscus with this paragraph because in the story it's about Saeng and she fails her drivers test, and notice a familiar plant which causes her to go to a florist shop. As Saeng learns about this familian plant it encourages her to retake that drivers test, to where as though the snow is gone and the sun is shining.	1	1		1																					
10535	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she is basically trying to say in the spring when the snow goes away and the hibiscus start growing she will test the plant again       	0	0		0																					
10536	4	""The author concludes the story this way to show that Saeng still has hope to succeed and adapt in this new country. She previously had a lot of home sickness, missing her grandmother and keepsakes from her child hood. The height of her homesickness is seen when Saeng comes back to her house and is explaining to her mother the nature of the hibiscus. �She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again.� Saeng is uncomfortable living in @LOCATION1 and wishes to go back to Vietnam. Butt by the end, Saeng�s attitude changes from despair to hope. Even though she has failed her driver�s test. Saeng is determined and hopeful to do at least something in this new country by saying ""...then I will take the test again.� Saeng has changed a good deal within this story and that change in attitude is seen with the exerpt on geese in the last paragraph."	3	2		3																					
3392	4	I think he put this in here because. I think he�s trying to say when the snow melts just forget bout the first time. And when the geese return it your @NUM1 chance. Then the hibiscus budding is you get passed what you were trying to do.	1	1		1																					
3393	4	This author concludes the story with this paragraph, because they both where talking about the cold or the weather and the @CAPS1 so it sated when snows melt as it talkes about weather or the @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
3394	4	The author concludes the story like this because it shows how the main character has been effected by the events or happenings in the story. In the beginning of the story we learn that the main character has failed her driver�s test. Also in the story she had spent a large amount of money just for one plant, in which her mother is shocked about. The reader at that point would expect for her to be very sad and depressed. But because of her grandmother and her homeland she instead surprizes the reader by looking on the brightside of things and saying that when the flower blooms again she will take the test again. This shows the connection between the main character and the plant. Giving the plant a humanlike existence.	3	2		3																					
3395	4	"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to illustrate the oevrall message of the story. That paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles. Saeng is coming from another country and is facing challenges not only in the garden, but in her life as well. She had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, by saying ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� she truly shows her determination and how shes not afraid to overcome obstacles that will face her. "	2	2		2																					
3396	4	The author of this story concluding this story this way because instead opsorbing all the pain she can look in to the future. Aso by looking in to the future she can forget about the past and try better in the future.	1	1		1																					
3397	4	The author concludes the story with this piece because she said �a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear,� I think she means that even tho the geese flew over with their heads up high even tho Saeng�s wasn�t. �Next year when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. She means she will not have her head down and be grateful of her new home and it with time. She looks at her hibiscus she will have found memories but not be sad.	2	2		2																					
3398	4	There are two reasons why he had conclude the story with this pararagraph. The one reason why the author had conclude the story with the paragraph because Saeng had silently had picked up a Winter Hibiscus so she can have to passed that driving Test. Finally; the last reason why the author had conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to try her driving Test again so she can passed so she can also drive when she gets down passing it. These two reasons were so confusing to figure out what the author conclude in the story with that sentence.	1	1		1																					
3399	4	I think that the reason why the author concludes this paragraph in the story because he wanted to show the lone Saeng had for the geese.	0	0		0																					
3400	4	There are many possibilities as to why the author ended her story, �Winter Hibiscus,� in the way that she did. �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here�� is what Saeng�s mother says of the flowers Saeng bought unexpectedly. The ending almost repeats this line. When Saeng makes that vow, shes splently telling herself that she too is strong enough to make it through the winter and beyond. Also in the story ,the author states ��she realized many of the things that she had thought of as strange had become�almost familiar to her now.� Through this statement, the author shows that Saeng, of course, still misses her country deeply, at she will eventually adjust to her new home and prwail.  When Saeng makes a vow that she will retake her test in the spring, its obvious that subconsciously, she saying that she can get through these hardships. All she needs is time.	3	3		3																					
3401	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus when Saeng says that she will take the test again in the spring, so she can walk home and see the flower that she found. Also in the story it mentions that in her past childhood she had seen the same flower in her country, but the next time she takes the driving test she would like to pass. It shows that she was disapointed because in the story it say that she paid over nineteen dollars for the test. Her mother was astionished, and yelled at her for a second. Saeng began crying and her mother calmed to show sympathy for her. Now she has the determination to take the test again. 	1	1		1																					
3402	4	"Minfong Ho, the author of the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" ended her story with @ORGANIZATION1 thinking about the spring because she wanted to make @ORGANIZATION1's future more hopeful. The character @ORGANIZATION1 seemed depressed and always reminiscient of her past in Vietnam. When she sees the Hibiscus and Jasmine flowers she ""brokedown and wept"", and she remembers her grandmother fixing her hair when she smells the Jasmine. To make maTters worse for Saeng she failed her driving test, which is something that most teens find as a big disappointment. By this point in the story I felt sorry for @ORGANIZATION1 and I wonderd if things would get better for her because she was away from everything she knew and loved with just some memories and a winter hibiscus unlike the kind she had back at her name in Vietnam. Then, in the last line, @ORGANIZATION1 suddenly becomes hopeful for her future and ""when the geese return and this hibiscus is budding.�    "	2	3		3																					
3403	4	The concluding paragraph to the story �Winter Hibiscus� gives a sense of hope for the future. The girl, Saeng, has just failed her test and is feeling depressed. Through a series of event�s, her depression leaves her and she feels hope.�Then I will take that test again.� This final sentence shows Saeng�s determination. She was upset about leaving her home and she was upset about failing her test, but thanks to a flower, she got her confidence back. Whenever someone is upset it is easy to give up. Until the final paragraph, the tone in the story is depressing. When the author put in the conclusion, it was like a light at the end of a dark tunnel. The author is saying that even when things are hard and seem impossible, something will be the to lift your spirits. There is always a posative in negatave situation, you just have to look for it. 	2	2		2																					
3404	4	In guessing that it means that when winter or spring or whatever its harder to grow that garden. Also mabe its a challenge of some sort to make the garden grow by that time of year. So I would assume thats what its talking about with it.	1	1		1																					
3405	4	The  author includes that sentence of the end of the story because through out the story it was showing  courage,and that explains her getting better and showing  courage that she is going to go back and try to pass that test and not letting it get her down that she failed the first time.	1	1		1																					
3406	4	To me I would have to say that the reason why the author concluded his story with this paragraph would be of different reasons. To explain it could mean new begining or starting over. For example, when the geese fly away and came back, that means that the @CAPS1 are changeing. So with that being said, the @CAPS1 changing or starting over could represent his chance to take test can start over, and he will get another chance.  	2	1		2																					
3407	4	I think they think it will bring them luck	1	1		1																					
3408	4	The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows you can over come something if you have the will power. Saeng failed the first test. She bought a plant that reminds her of home. She planted the plant despite the cold, hard ground. She realized the once strange things were now part of her everyday life. She decided to retake the test. Saeng realized that even though you @MONTH1 fail once you have to keep trying if it is what you believe in. She also realized that she will never forget her home but she still can move on. Finally Saeng realized that good things can over come bad. After she failed the test she bought the flower. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because it summerizes the story perfectly.	2	2		2																					
3409	4	The author includes the exccept at the end for a meaning reason to Saeng. the hibiscus symbolizes everything, her home, her past, and her comfort. Saeng feels that if the flower can bloom, so can she. Which will enable her to get used to her new home and retake the test. It also resembles hope, because if the plant can make it through the winter and bloom in the spring, so can she. The author used this to connect the feelings of Saeng with the realistics of the flower bloomability.	2	1		2																					
3410	4	The author concludes that statement because the geese move south in the winter and come back in the spring, Saeng has failed the test in the winter but she will retake it while the season of spring comes. As Saeng fails her driving test and she see the familiar plant means she will come back to take the test. The geese have left but will come back when the season is coming. So both the geese and Saeng have a reason to come back north or retake the test. The author adds the statement in the end because the geese's actions are just like Saeng.	2	2		2																					
3411	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph to show how Saeng was Not going to give up. Throughout the story she had been feeling down. From when she failed the test and she misses Vietnam. So many things throughout where she and her mother lives reminds her of Vietnam. �She closed her eyes and breathed. in, deeply Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother�s long gray hair....� This made her very imotional, to see how many things reminded her of Vietnam. The author ended like this to show how the experience of all this affected her.	1	1		1																					
3412	4	The author choses to end the story like this to inspire a sense of determination. Saeng got the plant to remind her of her homeland and cheer her up. Once the plant is bloomed she feels like she would as well and be ready for the test.	1	2		2																					
3413	4	The author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement. �When the geese come back � in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.� This statement shows renewal and persistance. I think she added this because after realizing the plant can come back time and time again, even after the harsh weather, she knew she could do it too. She vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew  herself and get back on track. It conveys persistance also. The plant doesn�t die each season. It�s hardy and comes back. If the girl can be persistant and come back next year to retake the test, she will be considered persistant. I think the girl wants to be just like flower. She sees it as being indomitable, renewing and beautiful. No matter where the plant is being grown, it will always keep those traits.	2	2		2																					
3414	4	The reason for the author concluding the following is because she wants it to be known to the readers that saeng is not going to just give up because she fails it the first time. That she is going to achieve so that her mother can be proud of her and to show herself she is trying to make a effort. It states that saeng will retake the test again in the spring when the snow has done melted and geese returns and this hibiscus is budding. Not only was the hibiscus an important part to the story, it was a very important part to her life it help her move on a see how things change cause over time it will chage and develop and adapt to the changes around it. Yes it was a disappointment to her mother but she sort of understood why she brought the plant home. It might comforted her in a way. There was many different things probably going on where she was she missed the test it wasn�t home. She has to adjust and adapt to the situation that she is in. 	2	3		3																					
3415	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng failed the test and next time that time of year comes back around she will have another chance to pass the test. I say that because in the text it states that she paid over @MONEY1 for it all of the vegetable seeds in the garden didn�t even cost that much. That is why I say she concluded with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3416	4	Next year around the winter time when she she have to plant things again she is going to be ready and this time she gone do it much better.	1	1		1																					
3417	4	The author included this because she was showing that it was winter and the flower was goin to bloom and the geese were flying here because it is cold. Also the author said that because the story title is called the �Winter Hibiscus� which obviously blooms in the winter so that is why I think the author said what she did.	0	0		0																					
3418	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with a sentence stating that when Saeng�s Hibiscus� first bud appears in the spring she will be back to take drivers test. The author might have decided to conclude the story like that because what if the plant died, would she go back and take the test? The author was probably just wanting the reader to think hard about it. In conclusion, the author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� might have concluded his story to make it somewhat suspenseful.	1	1		1																					
3419	4	The story ends with that line because @CAPS1 draws strength from the hibiscus, so next time she will not fail the test. In the time that it takes for the hibiscus to grow she will be growing also as a person and so will be ready for the test. The story says, �Plants that she had even realized she had known but forgotten drew her back into her childhood world� (Ho). Saeng had a good childhood where she got love and support. By seeing all of those plants again especially the hibiscus she can draw strength from the memories she has. The memories the hibiscus bring back are also very sad. The story says, �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her �(Ho). Experiencing all of that sadness again will only make her stronger. Along with just the sight of the hibiscus other things will make her ready for the test also. The story says, �It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet towards the center � just as she had known it would feel� (Ho).The feel of the hibiscus @MONTH1 remind Saeng of distsnt memories, like helping her grandmother with her hair. All of these things will only make Saeng stronger so that the next time she takes the test she will not fail.	2	3		3																					
3420	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the spring when the snows gone she will take the test again.	1	0		1																					
3421	4	In the quote above it is telling that saeng is glad to be back. Saeng also states that she would be ready to do it again if she had to.	1	1		1																					
3422	4	I think  the author concluded the story like that is because it was cold outside. I also think that the author is trying to say is that when she wrote this letter it was cold outside and she wouldn�t take the test until it was warm again because of the cold. �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again.� 	0	0		0																					
3423	4	There are many reasons the author says �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again .� @CAPS1 the author said this because the girl left everything just to come to this country and she can not fail. The gil said  �That at last , she could hold on to. But where was the fine-foothed come? the hibiscus hedge? She also said this because the hedge was all she had from her old home besides her mother and when the �hibiscus is budding� means its starting a new life and is starting to grow leafs and the girl is starting grow and move on with her life. 	2	2		2																					
3424	4	The reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because if the author trys it again it might work out a lot better now they know what they are doing. Also if they try it again then if it makes enough they can sell it and make money so they will keep doing it for years to come.	0	0		0																					
3425	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with a resolution of Saeng in order to show how Saeng will not give up and how she is determined. The reference to the spring blossoms shows how Saeng will fight to survive through the hardships, which are represented by winter. Just like the hibiscus that struggles to adapt to a new home, Saeng is struggling to adapt to a new country the final paragraph provides a resolution to the internal conflict of Saeng throughout the story by suggesting that Saeng will succeed in taking the test. In conclusion, the final paragraph in the story �Winter Hibiscus� provides a resolution to the conflict in the story, and shows the reader Saeng�s determination.	2	2		2																					
3426	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because It show what Saeng will be doing and If she will go to school. Saeng didn't want to go school because she will wait For the snow to melt ond the geese return and this hibiscus is bucking, and prefers gardening to school. and garden remind For about her homeland. For @CAPS1 Saeng dug out hole and carefully lowered the winter hibiscus into it. The thing that made her thing about her homeland was the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan, The pungent smell of better melon wafled out. Another @CAPS1 she went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground, that show she care about the garden.	1	1		1																					
3427	4	The author concludes her story with the quote, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� because the author  is showing that nature and the plant are valuable to her. Saeng (who says the quote) believes that the hibiscus will help her pass the test. Earlier on in the story it shows that when she gets in trouble, she rubs the plant leaves in her hands to help her overcome the problem. The author is making the idea clear and portraying the idea that the plant helps Saeng with obstacles.	1	2		2																					
3428	4	In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year.One reason she @MONTH1 have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test. Also the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam it gave her the confidense to go out and get what she wanted.	1	2		2																					
3429	4	The author includes this in the paragraph to simply be sarcastic for you to know that it is almost impossible for Saeng to take the test afresh. I say this because she was being very sarcastic meaning she�s not going to take the test. For example, if someone were to tell me take a test and I said whenever @LOCATION1 is president again, then I�ll take the test. That would be very sarcastic meaning that it wont happen and I�m not taking the test, instead of just saying No. The author included that just to let you know that the chances of her taking the test is very low.   	0	0		0																					
3430	4	The author includes this paragraph inorder to show an end to the story and to  show that Saeng has not given up. Ho wanted to show how the plant and the geese represented the continueation of Saeng�s life in the United States. The geese will come back and the Hibiscus will bud and flower, and Saeng will retake and  hopefoly pass her diving test. This paragraph is not just a colosing but a new beginging of life for geasse, a Winter Hibiscus, and Saeng.	1	2		2																					
3431	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show @CAPS1 strength and encouragement. When she�s willing and able she will take the test again with more confidence. Saeng says this to herself to help her get through until she can drive. She�s saying by next spring she�ll take her test. By next spring she�ll be able to drive. By next spring she�ll be used to her new home. This paragraph tells that it takes time to do things you don�t always get it right away so keep trying.	2	2		2																					
3432	4	In my opinion the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was feeling down about not passing her driving test but when she saw those flowers she realize when she came to @CAPS1 she  forget all about her home town. So she decied to get back in touch with a nature side and hold off taking her test intill the spring instead of rushing things.	1	1		1																					
3433	4	I belive that the author concludes the story with that particular paragraph to that she still has hope of finding home and being happy. The hibiscus plant in her mind is a symbol of home and happy memories with her grandmother. So when the plant budds, she will feel like she is at home again and is happy, that is when she will take the driving test. Also, that paragraph shows that she is slowly getting acustomed to the new home and lifestyle, �A flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks deer and�yes�familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now, like these geese.� Through these examples I believe that the narrator put that last paragraph there, to show Saeng assimilation into her new lifestyle, and her acception of her situation.	3	2		3																					
3434	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng did not give up on the test. for example, she says �I will take the test again.� It shows that she wants to take the test and pass it. Saeng is going to wait until spring comes and when the snow melts to take the test. In the beginning in the box above, it talks about her taking the test. Then it ends with her going to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3435	4	"At the end of ""Winter Hibiscus,"" the author, Minfong Ho, concludes the story through stating, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. The author ends the story in such a way in order to reveal the hope that lies in Saeng's future. After failing her drivers's test, Saeng returns home with disappointment and sadness. This last paragraph, however, shows that soon enough Saeng's luck will change. The reader is left with a hint that Saeng will retake her test and pass. Also, this ending paragraph reflects upon Saeng's determined personality to overcome many obstacles she is @CAPS1. This paragraph proves she will not give up even after she was forced to live in the United states instead of her home. Her success in fitting in with her new life is shown when through the quote, ""Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the things that she thought of as strange before. had become... almost familiar"". Truly Saeng is a determined character."	2	3		3																					
3436	4	The reason the author concludes this story with the paragraph. The story is all about the girl missing her home country. This paragraph implies that the girl will adapted to her new country by the next @DATE1. The story and the paragraph show the girls strength to overcome. This this is why the author ended the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3437	4	The author is letting us /reader know that the give plans to do the same thing again next year when the show is  all gone, when the geese come back and when etcs  warm enough for the hibiscus flower to bud/bloom again! the author @MONTH1 also be concluding the sentence to show that this is the life the little give chose and she will keep up with new gardening till the next spring!	0	0		0																					
3438	4	Saeng concluded the story with that paragraph because it shows what she has just been through and feels she could go through it again. If she fails the driving test again, then she use the plants to overcome her problems. She @MONTH1 actually pass the test this time. The unique plants show that she is stronger than she thinks and believes now that she feels comfortable with the plants that bring back memories of her childhood.	1	1		1																					
3439	4	She shows that she loves her grandmother and she loves what they do like gardening and stuff like that. Her mother cares about her but she is really striction  her.	0	0		0																					
3440	4	The author concluded the story in such a way that the reader�s eyes are opened. It shows the reader that dispite what @MONTH1 happen, how bad things seem, and how hopeless you feel, there�s always a way to make it better. Saeng failed her test, was in a new land, and had lost her grandmother, but still planned to try again. like the waves on the shore, they will always try to wash away the sand by coming back again. just like these waves, Saeng is willing to try again, as should we all.	1	1		1																					
3441	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because that season is over and a new season is starting.	0	0		0																					
3442	4	"The author concludes the story with  ""when they comes back, saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt & the geese reture and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�. This quote meaning that once the flower buds she will take the test over again because saeng will have the courage & the will to do it knowing she will pass it. The flower represents something to her that gives her motivation and determination. Everyone has something that modilates them in life to keep them going & saeng has her plant. The author kind of gives you direction & idea where the story going to go also when the flower buds."	2	1		2																					
3443	4	Saeng in not only just dissappointed from failing her drivers test, she is also upset and missing her home of Vietnam. Walking home she spots a little piece of Vietnam right there in the united states. She buy the beautiful winter hibiscus, or saebba, to remind her of her past. The end of this story combines the two different, countries, cultures and almost worlds her life is from. When she says, �when they come back�, she is referring to the geese. To her the geese symbolize her life  in life in @LOCATION2 and how she has became accustom to it. The hibiscus is also a symbol of her life. It is a symbol of her life and past in Vietnam.It brings back memories and buying that plant was like getting a little piece of home. When the �hibiscus is budding� then she will attempt the test again. When this little piece of home gets bigger then she will try again. When she is more stable in the @CAPS1 culture, get still has a firm grasp of her own, then she will be ready.	3	3		3																					
3444	4	I believe that the Author ended the story with this paragraph, because I think it is showing that Saeng isn�t a quiter. Saeng can�t wait until the Hibiscus comes back. When the Hibiscus comes back she�ll retake the test and show her mother that she can do it.	1	1		1																					
3445	4	The reason why the authour concluded the story with this paragraph because when Saeng saw the geese she knew that when spring comes back around she would be ready to get different flowers. Also she thinks back to when she was in her homeland she could see when the flower s grew up from the ground. Although now that she is in the city she thinks the flowers will blossom like the ones back home where she misses alot. Lastly, she describes the flowers as her friends. She also remembers the �Madagascar periwinkle� growing wild out from the cracks in brick walls or tiled roofs. Basically the authour says that she is ready to look for other plants that she remembers from her homeland.  	1	1		1																					
3446	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with this paragraph to depict a development in the character of Saeng. At the beginning of the story, Saeng is dejected about failing her driver�s test. However, this ending paragraph portrays the change that Saeng undergoes. In the text, Saeng proves to not adapt well to the change from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. She finds solace in a native flower of Vietnam, a winter hibiscus. By ending the winter hibiscus in the concluding paragraph (��and this hibiscus is budding��), the author depicts Saeng�s change of attitude and her acceptance toward @LOCATION2. Saeng now feels that, like the hibiscus returning after winter is over, she will be able to return and pass the driver�s test. Also, the concluding paragraph depicts Saeng�s new adaptation towards the creatures of @LOCATION2. Prior to her imagination to the @LOCATION4, Saeng had no exposure to Canada geese. In the concluding statement, Saeng�s mentioning of the creatures displays her adaptation to @LOCATION2 (��when the snow melts and the geese return��). This shows Saeng�s development and adaptation to her new surroundings. At first, Saeng proved to have a hard time leaving her native Vietnam behind and embracing @CAPS1 culture. However, this concluding paragraph summarizes the noticeable change that Saeng goes through. In this way, the author includes this paragraph to note the development in character that Saeng undergoes.	3	3		3																					
3447	4	They conclude the story with that because the winter is over and spring is here and it will be beautiful again	0	0		0																					
3448	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they com back, saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding. Then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 then she will become more familiar. For example, the author says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many things that she had thought of as strange before had become , through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar to her now.� That tells me that she feels that over same time , she will become more familiar with driving and then she will take the test again. Then she @MONTH1 pass it	1	1		1																					
3449	4	 The author of �Winter Hibiscus� decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to @LOCATION1 and has had a rough time fitting in. She misses everything about her old home, from her grandmother to the old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels that all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the winter and bloom in the spring and that is what Saeng realizes she must do. The last paragraph said �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Spring is the time for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers start to bloom, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes she wants a new beginning as well to be brought I the spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph ties the theme of new beginnings into the story. It shows @CAPS1 new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it. 	3	2		3																					
3450	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that saeng really wants to pass the test. You knows this when it says �And in the warm moist shelter of the green house, saeng broke down and wept.� This passage shows that she didn�t want to fail. When Saeng got home she had the white bud in the pot and her mother seen that she was crying. Then her mother was going to put the plant in the ground, then saeng to the shovel and did it he self. Having her realize she can take it again	1	1		1																					
3451	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. First, when the hibiscus buds in the spring that means that the plant is about to bloom. That also means that Saeng will be ready in the spring to take the test again. Also the last paragraph is at the end because if the plant can make it, then the girl can pass her drivers test and be happy both ways.	1	1		1																					
3452	4	Ii think the author concludes the story with this paragraph cause the author is saying Its gonna be a @CAPS1 year or some change is gonna happen and he feels That could of did better than what they did and is gonna take that test again.	1	1		1																					
3453	4	The author concludes with this paragraph te emphasize the new beginning that saeng is looking for. She was so disappointed when she failed her driver�s test. &the hibiscus was the thing to make her happy. she needed a new beginning to start over in a new country &the flower, the flower the snow , the geese, & the test all symbolize new beginnings &challenges to overcome , the geese & snow represent a change in season, the budding hibiscus  represent new life,& the passing of the test represent a milestone in saeng�s life . Ending the story with this paragraph makes the reader expect something new & exciting to happen to saeng.	3	2		3																					
3454	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to explain to the reader that she isn�t done gardening, that she�ll  go back when it blooms once again. also she isn�t done. she�d rather garden than go to school. This is what the author concludes about the story with the last paragraph.	0	0		0																					
3455	4	The author concludes this story with the few words �then I will take that test again.� because she wanted us to know that she is not going to give up on something she failed once. She is going to keep going until she succeeds with passing �the test.�	1	1		1																					
3456	4	The author concludes the last paragraph of the story because she already knew that she should not be afraid of trying a new life or new environment. For example, in the story, the mother says, �It�s flowers aren�t pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months. here, this winter hibiscus. �It shows that the mother want Saeng to learn that Saeng should be strong even in times of difficult. Another example is, when the narrator says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before become, through the quiet repition of season upon season�� It shows that Saeng realized that the new place that she�s leaving right now is almost the same as their old home- In conclusion, the last paragraph tells that Saeng should face the new reality of the world. She should be strong and follow the flow of life.	2	1		2																					
3457	4	The author concluded this story for a internal adjust. Saeng's memories are expressed through the one at the hibiscus. The spring is a season where everything is fresh and new. As by spring, Saeng's hope would be restored and thriving, when the budding hibiscus, and the will have the ability to try at the test again with more strength and inspiration. 	2	2		2																					
3458	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with Saeng, the main character, vowing to attempt the driving test in the spring when the hibiscus is blooming. This is a way of showing the reader that even after this story ends, Saeng will not give up. The author adds the thought of the hibiscus on bloom because the hibiscus is a symbol of strength for Saeng. The hibiscus flower is common in her home country and the hibiscus she bought reminds her of everything she left behind when she came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam. Saeng is trying to accept her new life style and uses the hibiscus as a tool to help her through the tougher times. After Saeng buys the flower she vows to retake the failed drivers test after spring comes. Spring is a symbol of fresh start. Saeng also feels that if the hibiscus can make it through the winter in @LOCATION1 so can Saeng. The conclusion for this story uses a lot of imagery that suggest that Saeng will be strong and continue to live in @LOCATION1. 	3	3		3																					
3459	4	The resoned the author concludes the story with this paragraph because I she fail the test and make your learned to apprecite nature a litter bitter.	1	1		1																					
3460	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring.	0	0		0																					
3461	4	The author states that idea because if you can not do it once do it again. First, if you take a test and cant pass it the first time do it again and you will be able to pass. For example, in the story Saeng could not pass a test so they could have let her take it again to see if she can pass it. Second, she could ask for help or use a book and study. For example, it will help you pass a lot easier if you study hard enough. That is what I think the statement means.	1	1		1																					
3462	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because its how each year will begin and end.	0	0		0																					
3463	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is willing to give the test another try. She is now more open �minded about the situation. In the beginning of the story, Saeng was upset and annoyed about failing her driver�s test. For example, �the tearstains on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I-I failed the test,� Saeng said to her mother. Obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself. The author didn�t want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending. Saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. For example, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� I believe that this attitude was because of the memorys of her mother country that soothes her and also her mother. In conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal.	2	3		3																					
3464	4	"The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the motivational paragraph  because he/she wants to show the reeder that  Saeng is determined to adapt to her new life and home and overcome common  obstacles like a driver's test. Saeng had a hard time coping with her problem so she bought a hibiscus because it reminded her of home. I think that the line �and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" from the last paragraph is a symbol for growing up and overcoming obstacles. The conclusion for the story is a nice ending."	2	2		2																					
3465	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because when the snow melts and the geese return, she going to have higher confidence in taking and passing the test. After she failed the test later on in the story the geeses had flew away. So when the geese return the geese will remind her of what had just now happened. When the snow melts and spring comes the hibiscus flower will bloom once again.	1	1		1																					
3466	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� in the spring come back the new hopes ,comfort belive, As  she said in the story �in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, the I will take that test again.� She hear when the hibiscus comes back brings new hopes to the life to take that test for. Here the hibiscus mean  hope. Second of all when she said �the geese return and this hibiscus is budding � she  means that is comfort for her it strong than hope and more if her mom helps her blue in her  self because is not easy to do it without her mom comfort. Lastly she said�Canada geese flew by, their faint honks dear and yes familiar to saeng  now. Almost reluctantly she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of a strange before had became, through the quiet repetitions of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� She mean that the season is coming and the hibiscus  grow she will regain the blive  and the strength that she need to have to take the test the hibiscus means a lot to her means vew  hopes ,comfort, and belive.	2	3		3																					
3467	4	"Coming back from failing her driving test, Saeng is comforted by finding the hibiscus flower. It brings back cherished @CAPS1 about Saeng's homeland, because it is very similar to flowers that grew by her old home. The author concluded the story by saying ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,"" to compare Saeng to the hibiscus. Like Saeng, the hibiscus must try to adapt to new surroundings. The author shows that Saeng recognizes this connection and is inspired by it. In Saeng's mind , if the hibiscus can survive being moved, then so can she."	2	2		2																					
3468	4	The story of �Winter Hibiscus� is a prolonged metaphor for both connections to a comforting past as well as expectance and the future. Saeng misses her homeland but she must learn to adapt to her circumstances, and pass her drivers test. The story is nicely concluded with Saeng's promise to herself that come spring, she will take the test again. The hibiscus flower itself generates this promise as it gives her some closure and alleinates some home-sickness. Saeng�s promise indicates that she is comng to terms with her situation. When she sees the Canada geese flying, she has somewhat of an epiphany about the seasons. �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things she had thought of as strange before had become.. - Almost familiar to her now.� I feel that was a landmark for Saeng and the conclusion illustrates that by allows to change.	3	3		3																					
3469	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, Saeng has a deep emotion connection to the memories and flashbacks that the Hibiscus brings back to her. At one point in the story, she cries out of mourning for her grandmother because the hibiscus plants bring back aware of memories. Later on in the story, she takes the plant to her mother. At first @PERSON1 is upset but then she becomes understanding of her daughter�s actions and feelings. Saeng is upset that she didn�t pass her test and her mother understands that. I think the author ends the story this way because wants the reader to see that because the hibiscuses is so important to Saeng and reminds her of her past, she will have a reason and motivation to continue and reach her goal of passing.	2	2		2																					
3470	4	Since it is getting close to winter the geese are going south. The plants are losing there leaves. Saeng says that she will take the test again. It seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds it will give her hope and confidence. Especially the hibiscus because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother, when she first saw it and held the leaf it brought a tear to her eye. And when it comes back next year it will rejuvinate her.	2	2		2																					
3471	4	The auther concludes the story with this paragraph because she thinks that it will explain what happened to saeng very well.	0	0		0																					
3472	4	The author concludes her story with that last paragraph because it shows the relasonship between saeng and the habiscas, and how much just seeing it feels. It also shows that the habiscus  motivates her because it reminds her of her home land that she loves so much and that its like have a pysical memorie of her home land	1	1		1																					
3473	4	The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects.	1	2		2																					
3474	4	I think the Author ends this as the concluding sentence because it symbolize�s how the girl presecive things. The girl means when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding it means that it is going to be warm again, @CAPS1 means when it is warm again it brings her spirit up because it reminds her of her homeland. I think by her being remind of her homeland would help her take the test easier because she will be more happy. @CAPS1 I think will help her do better on the test. For example, the author said in the story that the flower bring her comfort @CAPS1 I think being comfortable is the best way to succeed and pass the test. In conclusion I think the author ends the story like that because he wanted the readers to understand a connection with the girl and her homeland, and how flower comfort her.	2	1		2																					
3475	4	the author concludes the story with that paragraph because it sounds like a interesiting ending paragraph that have something to do with the story	0	0		0																					
3476	4	I think the author concludes the story with that saying because it shows that she is adappting to the new place. It @CAPS1 shows that she isent going to give up. Just like the geese don�t give up flying back and forth ever winter and spring. 	1	1		1																					
3477	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� Saeng decides to retake failed driver�s test in the spring. She does so because she is comforted on the moderate weather of the spring. It reminds her of home, and Saeng is very closely attached to home. It reminds me of all the places I�ve been and how I still remember my favorite one. Like Saeng, I buy objects that remind me of my old home Saeng�s commitment to her old home makes me feel less different when I miss my old home.	1	1		1																					
3478	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because Saeng is going to start over and do better the second time around because she doesn�t want to disappoint herself. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3479	4	I think that the author concludes the story like this because it shows a new beginning. When the spring comes, everything comes back to life. Plants grow back, animals are seen again and the sun shines bright. This is a new beginning for them so it can be seen the same for her. She could try again because it gives her another chance. Another reason he ended the story like this is because Saeng loves nature. Maybe when nature is back around her it will give her hope and confidence to pass her test.	1	1		1																					
3480	4	The last paragraph of the story was: �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author concluded the story with that paragraph to show that she is adapting and that she is starting to accept the change. I think that because throughout the story she is upset and not really liking the change. �And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� The text says. This last paragraph seems optimistic talking about the flower blooming and the geese returning which seems like she is starting to accept the change. In my opinion, the author added  that paragraph to finish the story to show that Saeng is starting to accept the change and be optimistic.	2	2		2																					
3481	4	Saeng told her mother that she failed the test. She she what to make up for it. By helping out in the graden. Her mother usher in and started to make dinner.	1	1		1																					
3482	4	The Author concludes that, when the geese come back she will take the test because she believes she will be more ready for the test then it will be easier in the spring. This will give her more time to learn & study & hopefully her head will be more focused instead of thinking about her home. It will be easier to complete the drivers test in spring. She feels bad like she let her mother down for failing it, �I just stared at the hibiscus,� this tells that she felt to ashamed to even look at her mother. So next spring she wants to make her mom happy & pass cause she will be ready.	1	2		2																					
3483	4	The reason the author chose this paragraph is because the paragraph means that when the snow melt and all the geese returned, the flowers @CAPS1. That one flower she had to @CAPS2 tests on.	0	0		0																					
3484	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph she did; to tell people never to give up. She tells people never to give up through this method because she realizes at the end, she will be prepared. In the story the line �.. Slowly fading into the distance.� Could mean she realizes what happens; happens and never stop doing or going to a goal you want. One more reason she @MONTH1 have used this is, that even tho your down you have friends and family to pick you up from it. The line �� Through the quiet repition of season upon season.�. This basically said that she just needed to get into routine and she will be able to do it.	1	2		2																					
3485	4	The author concludes the story with this sentence because she wanted to make a comparison between flowers and the test. To finish with this shows she will try season after season just like geese come back every year. Since she tries to make a??? Shows she hasn�t given up she will keep trying year after year. Also, it says that this girl is determined and she won�t stop trying till she gets it right. Next, this last paragraph can tell you about the whole story. Lastly, I think it gives a feeling for the whole story.	2	2		2																					
3486	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph so the reader has something to think about.When the author concludes with something like that he/she wants the reader to make there own ending or pridicshon. And some times it means a sequel.	1	1		1																					
3487	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it makes the story a happy ending how she doesn�t give up and is taking the test again. Also she doesn�t want to disappoint her mom she wants to make her happy and give the test a second chance.	1	1		1																					
3488	4	She ends it with that statement to show that she is ready to relive spring in the new country now that she is comforted by the hibiscus. The test is adapting to the new country and she failed it she believes because she had to be comforted by her native plants, but she believes that she will pass the test next year because every repetition of the season allow her to become  more adapted to the new culture. When she says ��when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.��All those things tell her it�s a new year and makes it easier to accept what�s happening.        	2	2		2																					
3489	4	She realized that things come and go but also change. That content times of the year the world around her changed. She had no control over it. She also had to deal with living in a new country. Living in anew country was hard for Saeng. She had to eat new foods, hear new sonds, and see thing that she never had seen before. Failing her drives test was hard for her. Not knowing the launge and what going on around her was tough of on her. the world around her wasnt something she was us to. She knew she had to change herself and work harder to get what she wanted.	2	2		2																					
3490	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph to let the readers know that she did not give up. In the story it seem like she had thoughts of giving up but her thoughts of her homeland comforted her when she thoughts she was going to give up. But the last paragraph of the story she confirmed that she wasn�t giving up.	1	1		1																					
3491	4	I think the author concludes this story like this because they was beautiful `@CAPS1 gave her good luck because the @NUM1 time around she didnt kno they was their	1	1		1																					
3492	4	"To me it seam like the whoever was saying that must of been going through a lot of things and that they was feeling like they were being tested or something or maybe somebody left her that she really loved because it say �when they come back"" so @CAPS1 thinking somebody @MONTH1 have left or something."" And the reason I said that the person @MONTH1 have feel as if they were being tested because it says �I will take the test again.�"	0	0		0																					
3493	4	The author concludes the story with this because it shows that she is still uncomforalable. For example when she broke down in the flower shop. This shows that even though things can remind her of home it isn�t the same. You have to get used to and become accostumed to a new place. This also shows that she thinks with more time to get used to her new home that she will be able to pass the test.	2	2		2																					
3494	4	The author uses this conclusion for a reason. The reason the author uses this cliff-hanges of a conclusion is to keep the reader interested and wanting more. By saying,�I will take that test again,� the author makes the reader question if Saeng will pass the test next time and the reader will wonder what �the test� is.	1	1		1																					
3495	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she probably doesn�t want the snow to melt so that the geese wouldnt return. Also I think it wants to inform the reader about what Saeng was thinking.	0	0		0																					
3496	4	There was a specific reason as to why the author concluded the story with that quote. The author wanted to show how the plant gave Saeng a new sense of determination. Saeng previously was upset and tearing the plant apart. But It seemed that she realized how the plant was able to bud to the odds and survive. So she now was determined to battle the odds as well and retake the test she failed.	1	2		2																					
3497	5	In this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @PERSON3's life, the mood containing it all, was greatful, and showed how his parents gave him love through his whole life. Both his parents were born and raised in Cuba, and in 1956, they both moved to the United States. Starting their lives over again, and taking any job they could find. Then in 1961, @PERSON2, @CAPS1. was born. Both Parents raised him with love, and care, and introducing his Cuban background into his life.        As @PERSON2, was telling his story, all readers could tell how greatful he was to have a family like he did. Also, as he shared his non-� blood related family, and the remembrence on how his parents' life changed by moving to @LOCATION2, he showed the respect he had towards them.	2	2		2																					
3498	5	"Throughout the excerpt from Home the Blueprints of Our Lives, Narciso Rodriguez, the author, manages to maintain a single overall mood. In many parts of the story he tells about how much he loved his childhood so it lead me to think was nostalgia, but nowhere does it emphasize that he yearns to return to past times. He always declared how loving and selfless his family was, how they aided others, and how he became"" family"" with his neighbors. Due to this I have found the tone to be, loving and admiring towards his parents. This is so due to the fact that he states how his parents were so brave to leave their lives in Cuba behind just so he could have a better life. Narciso Rodriguez also remarks numerous times on how his parents helped so many in need. If in Rodriguez's position I would love and admire my parents just as much, if not more, for their selfless deeds and upbringing of their son."	2	2		2																					
3499	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir is love. the author finds out that family doesn't have to be blood related. In the author's neighborhood ""despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in solidarity and friendship"" (@NUM1). The author loves thier parents because they came ""as many immagrants do, to give their children a better life"" (@NUM2). The author is very greatful that her parents ""Mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" (@NUM3). The author's parents gave him a great life by moving to @LOCATION1 and ""turned this simple house into a @NUM4)."	3	3		3																					
3500	5	The mood created by the author is showing how cuban's lived and about Their cultra and how they lived and some people from other cultra's could be diffrent and don't @CAPS1 cared about their cultra's and some people do care about their cultra like narciso parents. that is what the author is trying to say. and that some people should respect their cultra and not @CAPS2 To be a different cultra.	1	0		1																					
3501	5	"The mood created in the memoir is happiness and gratitude. Narciso is grateful of his parents for moving to @LOCATION1, and still give him warm happy feeling of a house in Cuba. His parents passed down their culture to him and he is happy that they did. Narciso is glad to have lived in the home that they did, and all the opertunities that he had as a child. He is grateful that his family always got together and had a feast with cuban music, activities, and food. His parents gave up their jobs and had to Start their lives over entirely. Narciso is also grateful that he learned the real definition of ""family"". He is also very grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."	2	3		3																					
3502	5	"The mood definitely helps you feel and comprehend the story better. The mood is a mixture of both happy and sad because of the way the author states his ideas. For example, the sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" makes me feel sad because he grew up and everything is just memories now but he keeps those happy memories. Most of other ideas like ""I will be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" also carry the same reasons for being happy or sad. However statements like ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture"" makes me feel happy that his parents were so determind. Overall the main idea is remembering the good and bad times of his life and the mood for this idea is happy/sad."	2	3		3																					
3503	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" he/she incorporated love and passion into the mood. You can tell this by how fondly and strongly Narciso talks about some things. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm houses."" In this one sentence alone, you could feel Narciso's passion and love for this home of the their's. Narciso puts a great deal of love and thankfulness into paragraph @NUM1 and @NUM2 when talking about his/her parents. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of 'family'... I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" These two sentences are most likely the strongest in Narciso's memoir, these two are also the ones filled with the most passion and meaning. As you can see, in Narciso Rodriguez's memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"", the mood Narciso puts in it is love and passion. "	3	3		3																					
3504	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is grateful and fortunate. Narciso Rodriguez talks about being so fortunate to have his parents and his heritage of being Cuban. From paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 is saying that @CAPS1 was so happy and lucky to have his parents as parents which is the main mood of the memoir.Another mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is happiness. @CAPS1 makes the story happy by saying how great it was to grow up with his family. @CAPS1 also says that his family was a lot of people in his neighborhood as well. @CAPS1 is happy to have a great family. From paragraph @NUM2, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.""@CAPS2 are two moods created by Rodriguez in his memoir."	3	3		3																					
3505	5	"The author generally stayed in one mood. The mood portrayed in the story was family and friends are very important and they help what you will be in the future. This is why the author stressed how thankful he was that his family had come to @LOCATION1 to make him a better life and that his friends came over to share their culture. Also the author was saying that even in @LOCATION1 it was important to remember his cuban blood and culture. This is why he says ""...and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas, of the kitchen."" Also the author say's that a home is where geat memeries are and were you grow up, you should never forget it."	3	3		3																					
3506	5	The mood that the author creates in this story is a @CAPS1 sad mood But it is also @CAPS2, @CAPS3 the guy in it is getting a new Home and a new Life @CAPS3 His parents @CAPS5 @CAPS6.	1	1		1																					
3507	5	The mood in the memoir that the author creates is a very warm and relaxed sort of mood. The way the author tells you about his parents; the selflessness and the way they put their kids first before themselves really just makes you think about your own parents and how good they are to you and what they would do for you. The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden � red color yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with.  The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window. I love the mood that this memoir puts me in.	1	1		1																					
3508	5	The mood of the memoir is very upbeat, happy mood of how @PERSON1. Grew up in Newark, New Jersey in a very Cuban family and tells the story of how Narciso went through his childhood. This memoir really emphasizes the connection and love that Narciso had with his parents and his home. It kind of makes you think that there is more to a house than just walls and a ceiling and that maybe it's part of a family.	1	1		1																					
3509	5	Describe the mood by the author in the memoir. the mood by the athor in the memoir. Is that she had a hard time grow up because her parent's keep on movieing. bay the age of twent-seven year old. Narciso Rodriguez liveing with her family she live in a one apratment room, When she was growing up there were racism were she was growing up. When she was growing up her mother and father taught her how to cook, and the number one thing she learned is how to love some one	1	0		1																					
3510	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, enjoyable, and worth living. I say happy because they had family to be with, and other friends to help them if anything. I say enjoyable because the author talks about how they (main character) had the first birthday and first friend. I would enjoy all my birthdays if I was that person and also my first friend. I also said worth living because they had food on their table everyday. And nothing in the memoir said anything about struggling. This is why I explain the mood as happy, enjoyable, and worth living.	2	1		2																					
3511	5	 The mood created by the author in this memoir was very loving and caring for their friends, family and everyone around them, for example it says how his mom would always keep the door open for whoever was going through a rough time or untill they were back on their feet because she knew they would do the same for her and her family. Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life. The mood also shows how that somthing small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in.	2	2		2																					
3512	5	"The author of this memoir created a mood about family. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country the loved,"" this quote tells that the mood created by the author makes the reader realize how hard their pareents work to give their children a better life and education. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"","" this also makes the reader feel like there is a lot more to a family then what it @MONTH1 seem. That family gives one life and teaches love. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,"" this quote tells that home is not just a place where one @MONTH1 live, but that it is about relationships that are created there. These were some of the moods created by the author in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
3513	5	"The mood created by this author is clearly greatfull. The author shows how he (narciso) could never stop saying thank you. He honestly loved the feeling his mom and dad made him have, and all thengs they did for him.

I think that it is a happy mood because of the way he talks about his neighbors.

He never says anything negative about his family, friend, or community. Narciso is constantly thanking his parents for his heritage and thier will to give him a better life. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1, Narciso uses parentheses to give more background information.Narciso's memoir was a very heart felt story. It made me feel like even through hard times people can find the good in things. This story makes me think of my dad because when things go wrong he can always make a joke or find the bright side of the story."	3	3		3																					
3563	5	"the mood was definatly uplifting and happy. at first when he describes his ""house"" he says within these walls my young parents treated our traditional cuban ""home"". You see how he goes from house to home that then you know is a happy place for them. with their kitchen as the ""heart"" (happy heart) cuban music fills the air/ (which he adores). this is just a verry uplifting story how he was born into a cuban, Spanish, Italian people dealt with racism and his parents are welcoming in their extended big extended family  into sleep eat everything. this is a good family and like he said family is not about being blood related its about loving them the way they come and still be in their homes. their family is without a worry all about love and courage his parenths taught him something special and how you can have more than a blood related family. All you need is a little selfishness and alot of courage."	2	4		3																					
3564	5	The mood in this memoir is heritage love and family love. This is showed by the author when he writes about his home and how we learn to love there. All the friendships he had and family moments made him love his home. He show the warmth and love for his family and home.	1	1		1																					
3565	5	I think the mood is happy. because Spanish cuban and Italian in the same neigh borhood with out fighting, and it seems like they like than life in United States.	1	1		1																					
3566	5	I think that the mood created by the author was happiness. I think this because when @CAPS1 was talking throughout the story @CAPS1 talked about how great her life was and how nice your parents are. @CAPS1 talked about her life as being very nice because @CAPS1 grew up in a house that turned into a home. Also, @CAPS1 talked about the great cooking that went on in her house and all of the great music, that @CAPS1 still loves today. Also, @CAPS1 talks about how caring her parents were when they opened there doors to family that needed a place to stay until they got back on their feet. Lastly, I think the mood set by the author was happiness because @CAPS1 had a lot of her family or close friends living either above or below them. Those are the reasons I thought the mood set by the author was happiness.	3	3		3																					
3567	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that family is very important. Family is very important an example of that in paragraph @NUM1 is when the author @PERSON1 writes ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relatives.""The second way that shows family is important is in paragraph @NUM2 when the author writes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.The third and final example is in paragraph @NUM3 when the author writes, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 three examples show that family is the most important thing."	3	2		3																					
3568	5	I think the mood in this story was sad/happy. I think it was happy because it says he loved to cook  And he thanked his parents for teaching him to cook.  Also In paragraph @NUM1 Its a paragraph dedicated to his parents. I think it is sad because in paragraph @NUM2 it says his parents had very good Jobs but when they came to the united states they had to startover.	2	2		2																					
3569	5	In the memoir the expressed different moods. One of these moods were appreciative, he was appreciative that his parents made a house into a home. They made him happy by the way his parents passed on their rich culinary skills and love of cooking and their passionate cuban music which filled the air of his home. The author also expresses how he is grateful that his parents left their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved so that they could come to america, start their life over, have a better life for themselves and himself.	2	3		3																					
3570	5	The author in the story created a mood that you could feel all over while reading the article. The author created a feeling of homeliness and peace. He created this feeling because while reading he never uses a word about violence or hate. Also while reading he talks about how him and his family always helped each other out. He also considers his community family and that really makes you feel at peace inside.	2	1		2																					
3571	5	The move the author created in the memoir was that he made it so theres still hope. Even if your an immigrant you can still make it to the top. @PERSON1 family moved from Cuba when racism was legal. The neighborhood was a family, or unity. Now Narciso is a famous fashion designer. Coming from Cuba with nothing starting a new life entirely over was very hard	0	2		1																					
3572	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created Is happy and loving. In the memoir it says, ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 of people were very close to his family and @CAPS2 found out you don't have to be blood relatives to be family. Also it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS2 is happy his parents moved to @LOCATION1 and is grateful of the sacrifices they had to make do do it. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. @CAPS2 went from Just living there to it being his home. @CAPS2 appieriates all his parents have done to make his life better."	3	3		3																					
3573	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is how she learned the definition of ""family"". She learned the definition of ""family"" at what she calls it her ""simple house"". I know this because in paragraph @NUM1, she says ""It was here where I learned the definition of ""family.' "	2	1		2																					
3574	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: the blueprints of Our Lives,"" the author creats a special mood. I think the mood is kind of both happy and sad at the same time. It is sad because the parents had to leave all of their family, friends, and careers back in Cuba, while coming to @LOCATION1 not Knowing the language. He didn't even get to meet his real grand parents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba. The mood is happy too because the parents did all of this for their child. He gets to live a happy life in their new home, with their new friends."	2	2		2																					
3575	5	The mood set by the author is a very happy one. This is shown by explaining how happy he is to be a Cuban-@CAPS1 and be free of dark times. He also shows his happiness by explaining his qualities and family. Overall, Narciso Rodriguez wants people to be happy with their lives and family and heritage. That is the mood set by Narciso Rodriguez.	1	1		1																					
3576	5	"In this memoir gives a grateful feeling. Some of the reasons I think this is because like in paragraph @NUM1. The author says ""�our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuba, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevail in the United States."" But the main part of the story is that how he loves the neighborhood he lives in and the house he lives in and mostly how much the people are basically family in that neighborhood. And that is why I think the author has a grateful mood in the memoir."	2	2		2																					
3577	5	"In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood in the story is willing, greatful, and hopeful. ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times"" that quote represents that the family was willing to go through not having a good job like in cuba and segragtion to make a better life for their kids. ""My parents always kept there door open for the people we considered family"" this quote shows the family was was greatful to have a home and still let the people they loved live there with them. ""My mother and Father came to this country with such courage, with out knowlage of the language and culture. That quote showed that the family was hopeful enough that even without knowing about the country they still believed it would bring a better life. In the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the family was willing to do anything for a better life."	3	3		3																					
3578	5	"The mood created by the author is showing even though they came From Cuba they can still make a living and become bilingual and translate and help others Find @CAPS1. For example, ""Often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to got back on their Feet."" meaning the would help some one until the got a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 a apartment that was good for them and for what the make a mounth if they had Jobs. Therefore, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to many people we considered family"" @CAPS4 each other if the had problems. Also the mood was good because they came got an apartment and at the end every ones happy because it became their Home."	1	2		2																					
3579	5	"I think that the author created a very warming, and the loving tone. Narciso created this mood by including all of the greatest aspects of his home in @LOCATION1. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 he explains the endless celebrations he had with family and friends that ""... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."""	1	2		2																					
3580	5	What I think the mood of this story is really soft and explainable since it explains how these people immigrated from their country to where they live now just to basically get a better life. And they certainly did They are happy of ther home and the @CAPS1 is happy because of his amazing educational options. That is what I would say the mood of this story is.	1	1		1																					
3581	5	During Narciso's life, growing up in a small house doesn't matter when you're surrounded by people you love. The author created the mood of happiness, love, achievement, and being proud. Narciso was very proud of his cuban heratige, as well has his brave parents, that created a beautiful home and life for him. The mood was also happy because it's a very happy story. There is love and achievement in the mood as well because Narciso loved his friends, family, neighborhood, home and childhood. The achievement was of his parents comming over to @LOCATION1 and starting a better life. Anyone would be happy with a childhood like that because being surrounded by the ones you love and being proud of you and your family is what is important.	2	3		3																					
3582	5	"The mood created in this memoir was very greatful. Narciso was very very greatful for the ""house that his parents turned into a home."" And he was very greatful to his overall parents, for giving up there own life, to try to give their son a better one, with many more oppertunities than they had. He is also greatful to his parents, not only for giving him things they never had, but things they did have, too. Things like teaching them how to cook, how to treat others, and the real meaning of family. They also showed him the value of being selfless for someone you love."	2	3		3																					
3583	5	No matter what nationality you are you can get along with anyone. He shows that his home, to him at least was a wonderful @CAPS1 with nice smells, food, and people. He is unexplainable happy and grateful for what his Parents did for him. To him it was @CAPS2/heaven on earth. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in the humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not Just scent and music but love and life. He will never forget that house or its gracious neigh bor hood.	2	1		2																					
3584	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created by the author. The mood is happiness and joyfulness because in this memoir the author continues to talk on about his family a culture which is a perfect reason for the mood to be happy. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family."" this quot was found in @CAPS1 @NUM1, this quot also shows that his family was kind and generous. This mood involved the familys culture which Narciso loved so much. His beautiful culture was just another piece of the puzzel that fit together, and that last quot ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house in to a home"" found in @CAPS1 @NUM2 really puts every thing together touching the reader emotionally."	2	2		2																					
3585	5	"The mood that was created by the author in the memoir would be I believe love. I said love because basically throughout the whole story all that was being talked about was ""eternal @CAPS1"", ""a dore"", bonds, and unity. The family are imigrants and they came looking for a better lifestyle in a foreign country Just for the benefit of the children. From my point of view only loving parent would give up The country they all love in order to do something like that because they had to leave behind families, friends, and careers. Now their facing cultural hardships over Just one desition."	1	2		2																					
3586	5	In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez the mood is very warm and inviting. It is of home and family. Some examples of this are, he mentioen that the kitchen was the heart of the home and the Cuban music was playing all the time. The memoir also conveys a sense of family because the author often mentions large amounts of family and friends would often be visiting. He also mentions there was rarely a time when was not staying with them in their home until they got back on their feet. The mood of this memoir is warming and of family.	3	2		2																					
3587	5	"The mood in the memoir is very adventorous. In the memoir it showed how Narciso's parent's and relatives moved. At first Narciso lived in a furnished one-room apartment, then they could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment that was soon to be Narciso's home. Narciso was born in 1961, in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Narciso grew up with his family for a while. ""Family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Narciso will always be greatful and loving to his parents for what they did for him."	1	1		1																					
3588	5	In the author's memoir the author creats a mood and that mood in the story as happyness anjoy. It is happyness and @CAPS1 becuse he was happy for his home and how his parents were cooks. He also joyed the music and things he does with his family and relitize. I think this is the mood the author used in the memoir.	2	1		2																					
3589	5	Narciso Rodriguez, a memoir about growing up in a new environment with his family, Narciso puts a definite mood in the memoir. The mood, to put it in general terms, is happy. The author did not put any negative information in the memoir and only put a positive feeling.

This quote makes me feel so happy that I have a family that supports me and is always there for me. This memoir really changed how I look at things and made me relize how thankful I am to have my family."	2	3		3																					
3593	5	The mood changed throughout the memoir. First the mood started off depressing by saying in Cuba they had a one room furnished apartment. That when they came to @LOCATION1 and @PERSON1 could afford to move into a modest three-room apartment. Next mood was inspirring. It was inspirring because the parents were a poor family and they found a way to move out of cuba. Also because his parents were selflessly getting out of cuba so there children could have a better place to live. Lastly there was a mood of family. They were honest hardworking immagrants who extended a hand to help people in need. Also they were always had Alegria graced at the dinner table for meals and had the surrogated grandparents Sergio and @CAPS1 there too. The mood changed throughout the whole memior from depressing to inspirring and to family which it always was about.	3	2		3

When you talk about your family, and its culture, you usually dont feel sad about it. Throughout the memoir. the author says things like, ""a love of cooking that is still with me today"" and ""formed a backdrop to life in our warm home"". The author also talks about the selflessness of his parents, which he is very proud and gratefull for.

3599	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. The author uses words such as warm to describe things. ""Warm homes"" gives you a happy feeling @CAPS1 two gives you a happy mood overal. It makes you think about how happy the author is knowing they still have their family memories/skills.In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author using many words which set the mood of happiness, like ""warmth of kitchen, humble home, not just scent and music but life and love, gracious neighborhood, and simple house into a home. These choice words used by the author give you a good feeling and put you in a happy mood."	2	2		2																					
3600	5	"The mood created by the author is warmth. First off, in paragraph two, it says how his family would always cook food and turn on the cuban music. It also says how the smell of the food would fill the house. In paragraph four, it says how they would always have family members over for dinner. Some of the family members they would have were Grandparents, Aunts, @CAPS1, and cousins. The last reason the mood is warmth is because he said in paragraph seven, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That means that before they lived there, it was just three rooms; however, once they moved in, they turned it into a place where friends and family could gather and have fun."	3	3		3

3602	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez, his own memoir, his own memoir, we are told about his child hood. Narciso affects the mood by describing the setting. He writes ""could afford to into a modest three room apartment..."" in pharagraph @NUM1.  This gives you a humble feeling from the very beggining of the reading. In pharagraph @NUM2, he writes ""passionate Cuban music filled the air..."". This made me think of mexican culture. Narciso writes things like these throught his memoir. These lines give the mood of modesty and rich Cuban culture Narciso also writes about his birthday, and faimly. The parts that he writes about faimly give you a feeling of unity. These are the lines/phrases Narciso uses to give his memoir mood."	3	2		3																					
3603	5	In the memoir, the author creates a mood. The feeling, or mood, that I think that the author is trying to create is a very grateful mood. I say this because that author is talking about how he is grateful, or thankful, to his parents for teaching him things and for bringing him up in a home and neighborhood that was very united and close.	2	1		2																					
3604	5	The mood that was created by the author is loving. It teaches the reader that the heart felted sacrifice and hardship the parents endured is priceless and the love that an immigrant family has for one another is endless. This mood explains the true definition of family and the unconditional, unfadeable love that a family has for one another and for its neighbor. This is true because in paragraph @NUM1 it tells the reader how grateful the author is for having such persistent, loving parents whose faith and determination for a better future taught the author how to love and appreciate the courage and strength one must have to overcome the struggles and barriers on this pursuit of happiness everyone is destined to follow. The mood of this memoir explains how precious is a home and the memories contained in it. This is the mood the author created in his memoir.	2	3		3																					
3605	5	The mood that's created by the author in the memoir is happiness but at the same time sadiness or to give up. Happiness is one mood because the author describes how his family has lived in @LOCATION2 (New Jersey) and how his family was not the only one to immagrate from their country. Their neighborhood is made up of Spanish, Cuban and Italian immagrants. The author has also made a few friends his first one being Alegria or the landlord's daughter. But the author did show some sadiness when he and his family had left Cuba. They had left friends, family, jobs and their country that they had loved. The author still listens to Cuban music when he does cook.	2	2		2																					
3606	5	"The mood that the author sets is thankfullness. He is thankful for all the things, scarifices his parents had to for him. For example ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give thier children a better life, even thought it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This is why the author wrote this memoir to thank his parents for what they did for him."	2	1		2																					
3607	5	In the memoir the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates a mood of faith throughout the reading. As the author describes the parents moving into the United States, it tells how they had to leave behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. The motivation to do so reveals the parents faith in creating a home just as good as before. The author is very grateful as he admires his parents faith that has traveled so far over time. Rodr�guez believes his parents have more courage then anyone and have expressed so much generosity upon him and others to always have their arms open to help others. It was the parents faith at the struggles would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times.	2	3		3																					
3608	5	The mood That is created by the @CAPS1 In The memior's...The only @CAPS2 I can give For a mood is Friendship. Throughout the whole memoir The @CAPS1 @CAPS4 about everyone is @CAPS5 to each @CAPS6 @CAPS7 The @CAPS8 how The whole memior is about Friendship.	1	1		1																					
3609	5	"Reading this article expresses many different mood changing from the auther. While reading you can notice he's proud of his Cuban culter explaining how united his family has always been for as long as he can remember. Most important his so greatful to his parents for everything they've been through to see him sucuss in life and that's what I admire the most from the author. This story is giving thanks to his parents and his culture. He mood is mostly proud and thankful throughout the whole story. Like at the end when he says ""I learned the definition of ""family"", meaning his family was there for each other and and love was all over. This pasage made me realize everything my mother went through to see my brother and I success, so I can say I can relate to the auther."	3	2		3																					
3610	5	The mood created in the memoir is greatfulness. Narciso is telling the story in honor of his parents selflessness. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do. They worked as hard as they could and made him a home and a childhood he could be happy with.	1	1		1

3613	5	This memoir had one theme that meant many different things. One theme was helpful. The family moved to the @LOCATION1 from Cuba in 1956 and had many hard ships and struggles. Because they know what it feels like they decisded to help the other struggling people, and let them stay with them; that's exactly what they did. Another theme that I thought fit was inspiration. I think this family not only inspiried their children but other neighbors and other reletives. Last, I think another theme of this excerpt was heart � felt. The @CAPS1 � @CAPS2 family risked everything to help other families. That's was a very nice action they took on them. One person can slowly make a difference, person by person; that is exactly what this family did.	1	3		2																					
3614	5	The author was speaking very proudly and happy about her parents. The author explained how her parents were very courageous and brave for leaving their home land. That's because neither of them spoke english. Also because they had to leave their lives back at home and start all over again.	2	1		2																					
3615	5	"The mood in the memoir is happy. It is happy because it is a talking about Narciso's memories. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The mood is also appreciative. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" The mood is also sad. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. So there was several moods in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
3616	5	"In this excerpt, Narciso Rodriguez describes his childhood home and extended ""family."" The mood of this duration is very warm and happy.

3627	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood, that is overall cheerful, warm, and happy. He does this through his word choice. ""passed on to me their rich culinary skills, and a love of cookig that is still with me today."" (par @NUM1). He decribes his parents cooking skills as ""rich"" and he describes his feelings toward cooking as positive. Another example of the mood he creates is how he describes his relationship with other people. ""all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship."" (par @NUM2). From this quote, you can tell that he has a very close relationship with all the people. Another example is when he says, ""always filled the air with not just scent and music, but life and love.""

3629	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is depressing. I think that because it talks about his parents getting immigrated and then the end is sort of happy, because his parents turned it into a home.	1	1		1

He describes how their selfless acts of leaving Cuba and creating a new life in @LOCATION1, helped create a strong foundation for him to grow up on. He says how his parents left behind their friends, family and jobs in the hope that their children would have a better life.

Also he was explaining how he was really happy that their parent gave up everything in Cuba just to come be with their children, they Also didnt even know how to speak english when they first moved from cuba. So now pretty much their whole family lives close to eachother so they can all see eachother. Even if the parents can't find the jobs there looking for they were going to do whatever to make their family happy. Now that their family together They can spend the rest of there life happy together	2	2		2																					
3633	5	"The mood created by the author. Is that @CAPS1 was talking about is that theres some families that come from every were and so Narciso Rodriguez is prowed of coming from Cuba.""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowlege of the language or the culture. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.

3634	5	He gives a mood of friendliness and happy memories. He tries to make the reader feel the happy feelings he felt, so that people would understand how he feels and tried to relate to it. Childhood memories are supposed to give those feelings to the reader.	1	1		1																					
3635	5	The mood Narciso Rodriguez is trying to portray in this memoir is very relaxing and greatful. He wants to be able to show his readers that he is greatful for how his parents raised him and what type of enviornment it was. By reading this memoir one almost feels like they are at his house, surrounded by his friends and family.

3636	5	"The mood created by the memoir is very explicit. He shows that he loves where he is and he doesn't want to trade it for anything. He loves his neighborhood because for him it's like a ""melting pot"". There are @CAPS1, cubans and Spanish people living there. In paragraph @NUM1, the author explains how his parents house and doors are open to anyone who needs help getting back on their feet. The author also gives a sad mood at the memoir. In paragraph @NUM2, his parents lived in a one-room apartment hoping that one day, they can afford to live in a three-room apartment. That is the mood the author gives off in the memoir."	1	2		2																					
3637	5	"In the memoir the author has various moods. In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS1, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family... my young parents created our traditional cuban home."" The mood here is nuetral but kind of happy because the author is talking about her house. In paragraph @NUM2 it @CAPS1, ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" This mood is @CAPS2 because the author is talking about the parents hardships. Also, in paragraph @NUM3, it @CAPS1, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also shows that the mood is happy because the author is grateful. These are the various moods that the author had in the memoir."	3	2		3																					
3638	5	"The author creates a proud mood in the memoir. The author gives information about his background and how his parents were proud of it. Paragraph two states ""I was born into this simple house...my young parents created our traditional Cuban home...the innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" Narciso's parents tired to influence as much as their Cuban heritage as they could. Narciso parents were always kind and loving to others. Paragraph four states ""My parents always kept their arms open and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" Though his parents didn't seem to have much money, they still housed others until they got back on their feet. Narciso parents worked hard knowing that they wouldn't get what they deserved. Paragraph five states ""The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved."" His parents worked hard for what they worked for and no one can take that away. In conclusion, the author makes the reader feel praud for what Narciso's parents have done."	3	3		3																					
3639	5	"The @CAPS1 in this memoir is joy and happiness. There is also caring and selflessness. This memoir describes how @ORGANIZATION1 grew up and his meaning of family. His family was very genorous to the people in their @CAPS2. On paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone Staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet"". His family was (seemed) very giving to their community. Because of Narciso's culture and family values, they have impacted his life today.Narciso parents were selfless. They would give up their living space to a friend who was having a hard time. They always had more then @NUM2 people at the dinner table and always more then @NUM2 people staying at their house. All these events have left Narciso Rodriguez with a sense of pride in his family and community."	3	3		3																					
3640	5	I think the author's mood was kind of like @CAPS1. I said that because as he was going along in the memoir at the end this statement is that his mom and dad turn a simple house into a home. That statement tells me that the author feels @CAPS1 well he is inside his home or inside a home with his family members. I Also say that the author feels grateful because the great culture and heritage he has came from.	2	2		2																					
3641	5	I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life.	1	1		1

This story also gave a feeling of closeness and how ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative' @CAPS1 and his family opened up there house to many people.

3648	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was like hapeness and he had a lot of emotion. Because he really loves his mother, and father and his baby sister. There is lots of emotion because Narciso talks about how he lives were he lives and how long he lived in a one-room apartment.

3650	5	"The mood in this memoir was soft, with an exception. I say that the mood is soft because it has a nice thankful mood that's really telling everyone how grateful he is of his parents and their care. It's also saying that there was racism and segragation, so in that paragraph (which is the exception) the mood is more of a rougher mood, I say rougher as in ""a rough life,"" having to deal with racism and segragation. Back to the soft mood, @PERSON1 also mentions his friend and her putting meals on the table and having his family there regularly, this reminded me of when someone is going through a tough time and the camunity helps out by sometines cooking neals. This was nice of Alegria (@ORGANIZATION1's friend). And also, how they would house family until they were back on their feet and having the feeling that their familly would do the same. for them. And lastly, the last sentence of the last paragraph gave the sense of them took a house and turned it into a home would be comforting. These all gives off the soft sense, meaning nice and thankful"	3	2		3

I think the author is sad because they died but he could be happy too. I think I would be sad and happy if my parents died. Thats why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is sad, and happy. My Parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the united states in 1956. In 1961, I was born into this simple house.

Another thing that he says is that even though almost everyone has a different race, everyone got along and help others out.

3655	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was very thankful. The author proved that it doesn't take the amount of money, or how big your house is to be happy. Sometimes its just the simple things. In paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" The author is showing the reader that even though they might not be family by blood, they still treat each other as if they were. In the last sentence of the memoir it reads, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows the reader that no house is a home without happy memories and great lessons learned."	3	2		3																					
3656	5	"Narciso Rodriguez created a mood of happiness and comfort in the memoir. When he told that ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" it signaled to me that they all must be happy together.

""and for which I am eternally grateful"" ""I will always be grateful to my parents"" @CAPS1 like these that are scattered thro-ugh out the excerpt show greatfulness, and love for his parents. Some other @CAPS1 like ""They came selflessly"" and ""... To give their children a better life"". Throughout the excerpt he tries to express how greatful he is to his parents, and community. One quote that can to mind when reading paragraphs @NUM1 & @NUM2 is ""It takes a village to raise a child"" I think thats how @ORGANIZATION1's community worked. They weren't just neighbors, they were family."	2	2		2																					
3658	5	"The moods created by the author in the memoir is happiness, love, and gratitude To start, it made me feel happy because of  the way he described his house, and how delightful it was. ""cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This quote made me visualize the scene, and I felt happy to think about the beautiful and enjoyable setting. Secondly, it made me feel loving to my loved ones like my family and friends. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance,..."" I love my family, and would be thankful if they tried to take their home country to the United States (if they were born somewhere else) with them. Finally it makes me feel grateful to my own family, and friends. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I would be grateful also. That is how this memoir makes me feel once I read it."	3	3		3																					
3659	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is like a mellowish mood. Almost like a fun loving feeling. The author had literally put himself into the memoir as I read. Paragraph two, had used parentheses several times within the text. The parentheses had given the author's look into his reality. Which had helped to create a calm mellow feel. Over all the mood was fairley simple, fun. In the last sentence it stated that the author had said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" It had basically described that the family did not have much, but made the best of what they did have. The last sentence had made the whole memoir have a calm mellowish feel.

Rodriguez has ""often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" @CAPS2 is grateful to his parents for turning his small house into a home in which family is valued more than materialistic things The first sentence of paragraph six, Rodriguez states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

3662	5	"The memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" creates a very warm peaceful and interesting mood. The way the author described the way she used to live looks like she lived a very loving and peaceful enviroment. She also creates a spanish theme to it which I could relate to. For example in paragraph @NUM1 she says she is very passionate for Cuban music and she's grateful she know how to cook.

Overall, the whole writing is in a calm mood.	1	1		1																					
3665	5	The mood created by the author was that how in the beggining it was a medium normal tune because he was Just describing who he was and where he lived and what his life was like.

Thats my opinion and answer to the story.	1	2		2																					
3666	5	"The mood the author creates in the memoir is gratefulness. The author creates gratefulness by repeatedly saying what his parents gave him and that he is grateful for it. First he talks about how he is grateful his parents got him interested in cooking. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their... love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This shows the author is grateful for his parents showing him to love cooking. Another time the author is grateful is in paragraph @NUM2.

3668	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy. It made me feel happy because it was good to know that ""'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This meant that all the people around you that care about you are your ""family"". Another reason why the mood of the memoir is happy is because I think if my parents were in the same situation that Narciso's parents were in, my parents would have done the same thing. My parents would have also wanted, ""to give their children a better life."" @CAPS1 this memoir makes me feel happy because of how caring Narciso's parent's were."	2	2		2																					
3669	5	The mood of the memoir is happy. I know this because the Rodriguez family crossed the border from Cuba to the United States to have a better life. They came in 1956, but had to wait until 1970 to be reunited with their Aunts and @CAPS1. They now have a bigger house. They are grateful they live in the United States.	1	1		1																					
3670	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by @PERSON1 a mood is created throughout the story. Mood is a feeling displayed to the reader through literature. In this particular piece the mood was proud and festive. @PERSON1 creates this mood by using various words and phrases. First @PERSON1 said, ""my parents created our traditional Cuban home"" This shows his family's pride because thier house looks like it did in Cuba. Also, the theme was festive because @PERSON1 describes the large parties and dinners that were constant at his home. Third, @ORGANIZATION1 creates a festive mood when he wrote, ""My parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate thier arrival to this country"" This quote creates a festive theme because his family all enjoyed partying with others. In conclusion the memoir ""@PERSON2"" there was a theme of festivity and pride through out this whole piece of literature."	3	3		3																					
3671	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, there was only one @LOCATION1 mood I think. The mood I think the author was trying to make people feel is happiness. There are a lot of examples that make me think that. One example that I think is best is the last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" I think this is the best example of happiness because even though they didn't live in the biggest house, the were still happy with what they had. That is what I think the mood created by the author was."	2	2		2																					
3672	5	"The mood created in ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a profound sense of closeness and selflessness that so enriched Narciso's childhood. The mood created by Narciso comes from his memoir, in which he lived a poor life, but a life that was enriched by friends and family that had a very close bond, one that overcame racism and tough time. ""all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""      The mood created by Narciso displays how his community acted, and shows how close is friends and family were. It is a mood that helps readers understand Narciso's community.       The mood created by Narciso is also one of selflessness, as Narciso describes his community as one of ""honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily of their own kind, were clearly in need.""       @CAPS1, Narciso creates a mood of closeness and selflessness."	2	2		2																					
3673	5	@PERSON1 is a short story about a boy who is very grateful & shows a lot of appriciation torwards his parents. He feels that he is at home even though he moved to @LOCATION1. In paragraph @NUM1 it said his parents created his new home to look like a cuban home he had back in cuba by putting cuban thing on the wall. I feel that in this short story he is very grateful because he said in paragraph @NUM2 he will never forget how his parents turned this simple house to a home. @PERSON1 is a very calm and happy short story.	2	2		2																					
3674	5	Narciso Rodriguez loves his family and home very much. In his memoir, he talks about the sacrifices his parents made and how truly grateful he is that his parents moved to New Jersey for a better life for themselves and him, no matter what the cost. His memoir is all about the love for his parents and his gratitude toward them. He really wants people to be able to feel to happiness that he feels when he thinks about his home and his wonderful life that his parents provided for him. He realizes his luck and therefore his memoir is very upbeat and shows that even in hard times, you can live life to its full extent.	2	2		2																					
3675	5	"In this memoir, there is more than one mood. There is love, friendship, and happiness Narciso expresses love for her parents and friends in paragraph @NUM1. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The author is saying that everyone comes toge-ther and that they all care for eachother. She expresses friendship in parag-raph @NUM2. When she says that her babysitter was her first friend. Finally, she expresses happiness. In paragraph @NUM3, when she is saying ""she will never forget how her parents turned this simple house into a home. You could tell that she is happy, and grateful for her parents. Those are a @CAPS1 moods in the memoir."	2	3		3																					
3676	5	the @CAPS1 that the author created in the memoir was an uplifting one. His memoir talked about growing up in the gattr of Newark, New Jersey (which became more of a ghetto), during the time of immigration. His neighborhood was full of Spanish, @PERSON1, and Italian immigrants. His family would come over and they would have dinner together, and they would have people stay in their house until they got back on their feet. He had a childhood full of family and friendship. which is great to have.	1	1		1																					
3677	5	"The mood of the excerpt is very bright. The author describes her risk taking, loving parents. The author describes the many things her parents have given to her. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home... Both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today... Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house.""     As you can see, the author. Narciso Rodriguez, describes her young life and home with happiness and greatfullness. This is all generously spoken within the depths of the excerpt. Many authors enjoy using these tones to express their own personal feelings and opinions about the matter. In this case, the author wanted to express joy in her writing."	3	2		3																					
3678	5	"The author created a very grateful/happy mood in the memoir. For example in paragraph @NUM1 when Narciso says ""I will always be greatful to my parents for the love and sacrifice. When he is saying this he is showing he is happy w/ his parents. I the memoir he talks about how he loves his house and why he loves his house and all the great memories in that house and that shows that this memoir mood is a more happy mood instead of sad for example paragraph @NUM2 when he says ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this combo house were a cuban feast always filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love."" Also when he said in paragraph @NUM2 that"" It here where i learned the real defenition of family. And for this i will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things i learned there about how to love."	3	3		3																					
3679	5	"The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy. I think there is hapiness because of what it says on paragraph @NUM1. ""In our neighborhood, despite the customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in a great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS2 that mean that there were a happy and friendly family. In conclusion, that's the mood I think the @CAPS1 created and some reasons why."	2	2		2																					
3680	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is intresting. First of all, his parents ""originally from cuba but arrived in the united states in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one room apartment, twenty one years old Rawedia Maria and twenty seven year old @ORGANIZATION1 could afford to move into a modest three room apartment I would soon call home. ""in 1961, I was born into this simple house situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Thats how the mood is intresting from the author creation"	1	0		1																					
3681	5	"The mood in this memoir seems to be a grateful tone. The reason I say that is because Narciso says how grateful he was to have parents that left everything behind so that he could have a better life. He also sounded grateful when he talked about the Spanish, Cuban, and Italian people in his neighborhood would work together instead of being racist to each other. He also mentioned that he learned the meaning of ""family"" while living in that house. By ""family"" he didn't mean blood relative Family. What he means by family is everyone that would come into his apartment and everyone in the building was family too. The mood he has while writing the memoir is grateful."	3	3		3																					
3682	5	"This memior created a warm, touching mood while he explained his childhood. I espicially think the part when he said ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and  endless celebrations that encomposed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"", because it shows an overall perspective on a normal day during his childhood. Also, where he states that family ""has nothing to do with being a blood relative really makes his memior interesting because it is also teaching lessions.All in all, this memior was great, and the warming mood is something that I won't forget, and I hope that I too too can write a memior such as heart-warming and interesting as this one."	2	2		2																					
3683	5	"The author created a joyful mood. The author said, ""growing up in this environment istilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" he talks about how people are close and they dont have to be related to be conciderd family. The authour says ""my mother and father had came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the coltur."" The author is proud of his parents for doing that, that takes alo of courage."	1	2		2																					
3684	5	The mood created by the @CAPS1 is happy because he talking about starting a new life and how grateful family he has. The way he is also happy is that he has his 'family such as cousin, aunts, uncles, and grandparents by his side. Where he live is also happy he loves it he has his friends and babysitter living above him knowing that they are their for him. That why I think the mood is happy by telling by the story and @CAPS2 words.	1	1		1																					
3685	5	"In the memoir the auther created the mood that Narciso Rodriguez was proud of his cuban culture and heritage and that family was very important to him because in paragraph @NUM1 ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" so acsepted people as family."	1	1		1

Friendly because they have ""family"" in the United states, and they Kept their arms, and door open for their ""family"". Also they had Courage because they didn't give, trying to learn the language, and finding a job.

3688	5	"The mood of the author is a very gental yet very happy tone. The reason it's gental is because he's describing how he grew up and what his life was like. To some people, they could just blab all day, but to most they have to dig through memories so that they can get the sceen just right. For example, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen.""     @CAPS1 the parts were the mood was very happy was probably parts that he could remember the most with detail. For example, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today."" The reason that he could remember this more clearly is because he probably cooks for his family using his parents resipies."	2	3		3																					
3689	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is deffinitty being proud. The reason I think the author is proud is because he explains how he grew up throughout his whole life. Also, growing up made him proud because he came up not having a lot, to being a famous fashion designer. Lastly, this memior's mood also seems proud because he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1, the author makes him seem proud of himself."	2	1		2																					
3690	5	The mood that was set in the excerpt Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez the mood that was created, by the author was to reflect on your life and to relive the great expierences that the author has gone through in his mind. It was just to think of all the great times the author had with your family.	1	0		1																					
3691	5	"In ""@PERSON1"" the overall mood created by the author is of gratitude and passion. Throughout the passage the author uses very passionate words such as ""aromas,"" ""endless,"" ""encompassed,"" ""instilled,"" etc. This shows that the author obviously wants to convey a very rich and passionate the and mood to the memoir. He probably feels very moved and passionate on the subject and wants to convey that to the readers in a subtle way. As a result reader perceive a very rich and passionate mood while reading the memoir. Another element in the passage adds gratitude to the overall mood of the story. The author added bits and pieces of phrases in parentheses that make the reader perceive the author's feeling of gratitude towards his parents. Phrases like ""(and for which I am eternaly grateful)"" and ""(which I adore to this day)"" account for the feeling of gratitude the reader perceives. Another way the author created this mood is with a more direct approach by stating ""I will always be grateful to my parents for thir love and sacrifice."" The phrases and statement show that the author feels very grateful for what his parents have done for him, which create a mood of gratitude. As a result the mood of ""@PERSON1"" is one of passion and gratitude that is shown through the authors choice of words and statements. That is why I would describe the mood of ""@PERSON1"" as being very passionite and full of gratitude."	2	4		2																					
3692	5	The memoir's mood is a sense of happiness because its talking about a place where neighbors are like family and everyone is very close. Like how Sergio and @PERSON1 became his surrogate grandparents, when they were people who lived in the basement appartment. Alegria, his first friend normally ate dinner with them. The whole memoir is about how his parents showed him the meaning of family and to be open to friends and neighbors.	2	2		2

3696	5	"The mood created by the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is very uplifting and happy. One reason I think the memoir is uplifting and happy is because it talks about how greatful Narciso is of his parents. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will allways be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I thought that this line was very meaningful and uplifting because he's basicaly thanking his parents for immigrating and giving him a better life. Another reason I think this article is uplifting and happy is because in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""Growing up in this enviorment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with a blood relative."" I found that uplifting because essentially what he is saying that family doesn't allways mean who you are related to but the people around you that love and support you. Lastly this article is uplifting because it shows love can make a difference."	2	3		3

""I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	2	2		2																					
3698	5	"In this memoir author creates a very specific mood that is the Same throughout the memoir. The mood of this memoir was a comforting and happy mood. One way that this mood was @CAPS1 was that they talked how their enviorment Showed a great sense of family and when I think of family I see the mood as comforting and happy. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". This showed the mood because his family always took in people and made them feel welcomed @CAPS2 reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it talked about how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met. ""It was a close nit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were Clearly in need"". This is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood."	3	3		3																					
3699	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the mood created by the author in the memoir is together the family is organized.

That is the mood that is created by the author in the memoir."	1	2		1																					
3700	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is lave. An example from the text says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers in the country they loved ."" @CAPS1 example from the text says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them my admiration for the strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In conclusion because of his parents love for him they sacrificed alot, so he could have a happy and good life. "	3	3		3																					
3701	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir is grateful, happy. The reason I say that because if my parents did that I should be very grateful because they did all this for me to be happy and for me to have a better life. ""And for which I am eternally grateful"". ""They Came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life"". Wow that @CAPS1 alot from his/her parents they are very strong and they did all for their children to be happy. This is the reason why I picked those two mood in the memoir!"	2	2		2																					
3702	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is many things. But, I think the main moods in the memoir are happy and greatful. I think the mood of the story is happy because the story tells about all the good times @PERSON1 had in his house. For example, @PERSON1 says ""here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" And, I think the mood of the story is also thankful because a lot of the story has to do with @PERSON1 thanking his parents for all they have done and sacrificed for him. For example, in the end of the memoir @PERSON1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" and in a way thanks his parents for everything. So, as you can see those are the moods I think the author created in the memoir."	2	3		3																					
3703	5	"The mood created in this memoir is very homebound. How the parents turned the ""simple house"" into the ""traditional Cuban home"" was shocking. The parents played the ""Passionate Cuban music."" and ""a love of cooking"" helped create a family mood, and it showed how much they love their heritage. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relitave. This family loved spending time w/ eachother, and celebrating. Over all, the mood is loving, happy, and caring."	2	2		2																					
3704	5	"The mood I felt when I read the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez was a feeling of togetherness. I got this mood because he is always talking about being together with his family and how the home he was brought up in truly brought everyone in his family together and this made him proud of his family and his Cuban Culture. His family meant a lot to him so another mood could be love because of his love for his family and the house he grew up in where he learned to love. His parents did a lot for him and, ""Turned their simple house into a home"". He learned everything he could ever think about from his parents and he loves them a lot. These are the moods I felt while reading Narciso Rodriguez."	4	2		3																					
3705	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, @CAPS1 created a certain mood. Narciso Rodriguez created a gentle mood that stayed constant. @CAPS1 tells how his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family."" Which means @CAPS1 probably grew up in a life without very much violence. @CAPS1 also says that @CAPS1 ""will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 wants his parents to know that @CAPS1 loves them very much and lets them know by thinking them.

First thing @CAPS1 the mood is happy Of this memoir is when the @CAPS2 wrote ""Passionate Cuban music (which I dore to this day)"" that meant that @CAPS3 really love her Culture music. Another thing is when @CAPS3 said ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, And for that true you dont have to be related to someone who really love to say that he/@CAPS3 is @CAPS5 of your family is Just enoght that he/@CAPS3 love and care about you like you for he/@CAPS3.

3707	5	The mood created in the memoir is the feeling of Cuban culture and the @CAPS1's home. The feeling could be described as homey. In paragraph @NUM1, this is where the @CAPS1 first introduces the custom of his house. And how it is. The @CAPS1 describes his house as simple with cuban music and the scent of cuban food flowing through it. The feeling that the @CAPS1 uses to describe his house is the feeling that the whole memoir had. The house kinda flooded the memior with it's feelings. Also this memior didn't only show cuban feeling it also gave of family vibes (like how a family is happy and together) It expressed how the @CAPS1 was close to his family	1	2		2

3709	5	The author was @CAPS2 likely describing his happy @CAPS1. Because in the memair it was talking about how he loved his home and his parents Cooking and music. He was @CAPS2 grateful for his parents caring and selflessness. He liked how his home was a community for Spanish, cuban, and italian immagrants. He thought back to his memorable birthdays and feasts and it made him happy. This is my summary of Narciso Rodriguez's mood of the story.	2	2		2																					
3710	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. Narciso projects a very greatful, thankful + optimistic mood. Every sentence, he thanks a specific person for bringing such greatness to his life. In paragraph six, Narciso says, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" and it shows that Narciso is very greatful towards his parents, for bringing him to @LOCATION1, and him being who he is today, + who he was. Narciso also projected off a happy and thankful tone. He felt that his life was made so much better in @LOCATION1, than it wouldve or could've been in Cuba. Lastly, Narciso appears to be optimistic. Although he came from a little two-family home, he was still very hopeful about how his life would be better in @LOCATION1, and thanks his parents for their generous sacrifice. In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" Narciso appears to be a grateful, thankful + optomistic man."	3	3		3																					
3711	5	"The mood described by the author in the memoir is a greatful and happy feeling I say this because the main character, Narciso Rodriguez, Always brings up how he is greatful for his partents helping him in his childhood. In paragraph @NUM1, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Also, the mood is a happy mood. I think this because the story states, ""At tine when overt racism was the norm... All of the cultures came together in great soidarity and friendship."" Even though there is racism, @CAPS1 one is friends."	2	2		2																					
3712	5	"The overall mood in Narciso's memoir is admiration and gratefullness towards his parents. He expresses his gratitude several times. Like on paragraph @NUM1. It says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" @CAPS1 all of paragraph @NUM1 is about how grateful he is to his parents. Another example of his gratitude towards his parents is on paragraph @NUM3. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"" Also all of paragraph @NUM3 is about his admiration towards his parents. So, the mood @CAPS1 in the memoir was love, towards his parents. "	3	3		3

3714	5	The mood created by the author was a warm and comforting feeling.

He makes everything sound really nice with every one crowded in the dinning room to eat.	1	2		2																					
3715	5	The mood created in this memoir is comfort. To me it is so comforting because it is such a happy memoir, where these two young people invite other people over their house all the time. They also let people stay until they are able to get back on their feet. There is not one ounce of sadness to me, just a happy and inviting family which comforts me. Another thing is the lifestyle. I love how they are proud of their Cuban heritage. They listen to their Cuban music and always cook their Cuban food. I love it when people are not afraid to be themselves. It comforts me knowing everyone is happy. That is why the mood created in this memoir to me is comfort.	3	3		3																					
3716	5	The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The author was explaining what the boy in the memoir was feeling and felt.

3717	5	"There was a mood created by the author in @CAPS1 memoir. Here are some points to help support this parenthesis identify a new mood, his gratefulness, and his view on things. First, parenthesis identify a new mood. When it goes from sentence to parenthesis the new mood appears then it goes back. Here is my reason why the story, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS2, his gratefulness. @CAPS1 is very grateful for how things turned out. Here another reason why from the story. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS3, his view on things. @CAPS1 had very fortunate times in his eyes.

3719	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a truely original mood in the excerpt. I would say he puts a kind of grateful mood in the excerpt. He is consteintly stating how grateful he is toward his parents for their selflessness, and courage. One example of Narciso creating a grateful mood is when he says: ""I will always be grateful for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing and I could have ever done."" This quote shows how much gratitude Narciso actually has for his parents. Another example where Narciso shows tremendous gratitude is when he says: ""they came, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" In this quotation, Rodriguez shows that he knows what it took to come here, he knows the loses that his parents went through, and for that he is truely grateful."	3	2		3																					
3720	5	"People make sacrafices for the ones they love. That is called being selfless. In the story, Narciso's parents are selfless. They left their family and friends to give their son a better life.

They gave up a lot and he recognize that. Rodriguez realized his parents were very hardworking. He respected his parents and loved them for everything they have done for him. ""I often tell them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" It's a great feeling knowing someone will do anything for you.Family is very important. @PERSON1 mentioned how his neighbors were all immagrants. They had left their family, too; and only had eachother. Knowing you have people who are like family is incredible. Although they can never replace blood relatives, friends are the next best thing. I think growing up, @PERSON1 learned to very important lessons. Put others before yourself, and work hard."	3	3		3																					
3721	5	The @CAPS1 the author created is sentimental, sad but happy at the same time. I think the @CAPS1 is mostly sentimental because the family moves to @LOCATION1 and kind of looks back to good memories that happend in cuba.	0	1		1																					
3722	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives has a happy mood. The author talks about ""passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" In paragraph @NUM1 which makes the house seem very happy and joyful. In paragraph @NUM1 the author also says ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home the very heart of our kitchen"" this makes the author seem very happy since they like to cook. Narciso Rodriguez talks about ""it was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and @CAPS1 celebrated my first birthdays"" the mood here seems that everybody liked to come to this house. This whole memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" makes the mood seem very happy and warm."	3	3		3																					
3723	5	"The mood of this memoir created by the author is a grateful and/or thankfull mood. The mood is grateful because in the first several paragraphs it mentions how their home is not a high quality and they do not live a average middle class life but a severely lower-class life. However throughout the excerpt it is mentioned how whatever they lacked in quality they made up for with the coming together of their ""family"". By family it means how the other immigrants came together as one and helped one and another. Narciso mentions how even though his family had very little to share, they would always share all that they had to offer with anyone who needed it. By following this example mainly set by his parents he learned about life's lessons that he will never forget and is forever thankful and grateful to his parents for showing him."	3	2		3																					
3724	5	"The mood created by the memoir is shown by many things. Through positive words, often mentioned thankfulness, and a cosy setting, a happy positive mood is shown. Positive words are oftem mentioned in the article for example it @CAPS1 ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people,"" in this the words honest, hardworking, and the pease ""extended a hand,"" (which means offered help) all invoke a happy mood. The authors constant thanking of things, like as the memoir states ""(and for which I am eternally thankful)"", gives a happy mood because people are only thankful for positive things. Finally this positive mood is shown through setting, which sounds happy and is described as nice. as the memoir @CAPS1 ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This descibtion of the setting shows a clear happy cosy, positive mood. The mood created by the memoir is happy, positie, and nice because the memoir is worded with positve words, has often mentioned thankfulness, and has a nice setting."	3	3		3																					
3725	5	The mood in the memoir is calm and thankful. The calmness is because there are no conflicts. The thankful part is he keeps thanking his parents For making the sacrifice. How they did it for the next generations. The mood in this memoir calm and thank ful	1	1		1																					
3726	5	Before reading about @PERSON1 I don't think I read about anyone who is more happy than @PERSON1. @PERSON1 is very happy about being an @CAPS1 citizen and still be very happy of having another country's background (in this case Cuba). @PERSON1 was blessed that he had his house. It was in a great neighborhood and the kitchen was the main place of the house. @PERSON1 was very proud of where he lived even though his house was not a mansion or even close to a big house. @PERSON1 was very happy about his parents, most of all. Without his parents he would have lived in Cuba and would not have known his great neighborhood and all of his family and friends.	2	2		2																					
3727	5	The mood created by the author is how much the author missis his or her home and were she or he was born and riesed.I think the outhor misses that pleace more then every and that she or he wantes that @CAPS1 back. that the auther well never forget what happened and what the auther did and @CAPS1 in that house.	1	0		1																					
3728	5	"In the memoir the author creates a happy mood. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he enjoyed and is thankful for from his childhood.

He also says how he is thankful for how his parents came to the @LOCATION1 ""to give their children a better life"". Finally he says he is greatful to his parents ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrife."" @CAPS1 in the memeor the author creates a happy modd by talking about his childhood surronded by family and thankes his parents for there sacrifeces they made to give him a betters life."	3	3		3																					
3729	5	There is o good moud @CAPS1 to this @CAPS2. the mood is a warm, happy feeling. Whenyou read the @CAPS2 it makes you feel @CAPS4. Just like being at your own home. But only a little different. This time youare reading a @CAPS2. It really explains what is going On. It als o give s alot of past information. Which I like in a @CAPS2. But @PERSON1 seemed to really enjoy being cuban. @CAPS7 @CAPS5 to really like her Cuban food. Her family was good @CAPS6. The @LOCATION1 was a bad place when @CAPS7 was growing up asa child. The reason for this is because of racism and segregation. But other wise @CAPS7 has a good life.	1	1		1																					
3730	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is love. I think the mood is love because he talks about the love and support his whole family had. One example is when he says ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" To me that is saying how his parents loved him so much (even though he was not born yet) that they sacrificed everything they had for their children. That is why I think the mood is love."	2	2		2																					
3731	5	The memoir Narciso Rodriguez from The blue prints of our lives, there is a mood.

He also feels love, love for his family and friend who were always there for him. He says That family goes further than blood.	1	1		1																					
3733	5	The mood of the story is some what sad and some what happy. It's sad because he comes from a not welthy family and were immergrants. but happy because he finaly knows the meaning of family and these are the moods of the story.	1	1		1																					
3734	5	I think the mood is a very happy great full mood. the speaker seams very happy of her live and how it was growing up. Narciso seems very greatful of her parent and every body  around her and her whole life growing up. Also about how her neighbor hood was. How every body was happy and were all firends and how there were a lot of imagrants in her neighborhood.	1	1		1																					
3735	5	"What is the mood of the memoir? The mood is elated. One reason is because ""My parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This seems very happy to me because moving from your country can be hard. So his parents brought some of cuba with them. That is the reason the mood is elated."	1	1		1																					
3736	5	"In this memoir, the author creates a very calming and relaxing mood. The author talked about how family isn't about blood, and how a house doesn't have to be spectacular to be a home. The authors said in the memoir ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This basically means that with all the love and care his parents had toward him and his neighbors, created a great place to live. The mood also very hopefull. This is because the author's parents came to america with nothing, but with all their hard work, they over came their struggles and helped everyone else in their neighborhood. Another mood the story had was a loving mood, because even though his neighbors weren't his blood relatives, he loved them as if they were."	3	3		3

""Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants"" form their community. The Rodriguez famly whas enormouse and their doors where open to any one who needed assistance. The table was allways full for dinner at their house. The mood set was one of very kind and helpfull personalities. Families are bigger than just ""blood relatives"" they are the people who you care about and help, or who help you. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	2	3		3																					
3738	5	"In this memoir the author creats a mood of grattitude. To support a claim like this I will provide evidence. It says in the article that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. This clearly shows how the author is trying to creat a mood of gratitude. His gratitude is being showed towards his parents. Also it says that They came selflessly as many immigrants do to give there children a better life. This shows how the family leaves there comfort to a troublesome life for there children, thus making the children very greatful. The mood created by the author is gratefullness and is shown throw out the whole memoir."	2	2		2																					
3739	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" the author creates a mood. First, The author shows feelings in this part ""My parents both shared cooking duties and un wittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today. Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. The author shows a feeling of a warm, wonderful household with music and cooking. Next, the author shows a feeling of a nice warm child hood here: ""Here, the innocence of child hood, the congregation family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompass both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" The author enjoyed a nice childhood, filled with friends and family, all enjoying the wonders of their home. That is how the author sets the mood."	3	3		3																					
3740	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and loving mood. It sets a loving mood whe the author says, ""Growing up in this enviornment instilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood realitive."" This sets a loving mood because the author is pretty much saying that a person can be so close to you and love you that you consider them family even though you are really not even related. It also sets a happy and loving mood when the author says, ""They came selflessly, as immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This quote shows that Narciso's parents love their children so much that they wanted them to have better lives and to be happy. That is the mood created by the author in this memoir."	3	3		3

""I will always be greatful to my parents for thier love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more a courageous thing then I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. This is why the mood created by the author in the memoir was greatful."	1	2		2																					
3742	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir can be described in many ways. Here are some points to consider. First of the mood of the author is I think greatfulness. For example ""(and for which I am each currently grateful). ... (Which I adore to this day). second of all the mood of the author is appreciation. For example ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 I think another mood of the author is definitely love. I kno this because he talks about love and his family and friends alot. For example ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love. In conclusion the authors moods can be described in many different ways."	2	3		3																					
3743	5	"The mood created in this memoir is happy and warm. It starts by talking of things Narciso learned in the home. The Cuban music ""which I [Narciso] a door to this day."" As well as the culinary skills, ""I am eternally grateful."" Narciso is happy, therefore the mood is happy.Also, Narciso talks about the grat community. ""It was a close -knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand..."" Narciso goes into great detail describing the good things, like the community. The author also describes the selflessness of many immigrants including her parents. ""They came selflessly... to give thir children a better life."" Narciso Rodriguez describes many positive effects of her parents as immigrants. As a result of the positivity, a happy mood is created."	3	2		3																					
3744	5	The mood of the story is like a sad story then it leads to a happy ending. It starts sad because the family moves from cuba to the @ORGANIZATION1. They tell on nothing about the language or the traditions. It gets happier when they moved into the apartment and they find a job to work at. Thats what the mood of the story is.	1	1		1																					
3745	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Narciso Rodriguez, I believe that the @CAPS1 is trying to re-create his/her past in a way that teaches the reader a few important life lessons about home and family, such as ""It was here I learned the real meaning of family, and that you can turn a simple house into a home."""	2	1		1																					
3746	5	"In this excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a sad story. The mood the author is putting sad and happy stories at the same time. One example is when his parents left from Cuba for his son's own sake for a better place. His parents had great jobs in Cuba. His mother was a Chemical @ORGANIZATION1. and his father worked in a labratory. ""In Cuba @PERSON2,had worked in a laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering."" The author's mood of this story is sad."	2	1		2																					
3747	5	He was thankful his parents moved for him and thinks it was very nice. He said he doesnt think he would do that, so it was meaningful to him. His parents had come to give him a better life, even though they were leaving behind loved ones.	1	1		1																					
3748	5	"In the memoir of ""Narciso Rodriguez"" there are two contradicting moods. From chapters one to six Narciso said ""that all cultures came together in solidarity and friendship"" in his neighborhood. Rodriguez describes in-depth as well. He mentioned Cuban cooking and music, not a single detail was left out. There was so much happiness and bliss at the beginning, but it's soon faded as Narciso spoke of his parents. Narciso's parents, @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, both sacrificed their lives to live in @LOCATION1. ""In @ORGANIZATION1 and Maria worked first class careers, but it was the exact opposite in @LOCATION1."" They would take any job they could find. This mood quickly fades away as Rodriguez describes his gratefulness to his parents. Narciso is very lucky to have parents like @PERSON2 and Maria to watch over him."	3	2		3																					
3749	5	"According to the memoroir the mood created by the author is he is thankful for everything his parents have gave him. For example, he states in paragraph @NUM1 ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""Narciso always told his parents how greatful his is for them. But Narciso says ""But in reality there is no way to express my gratitude."""	2	2		2																					
3750	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It is showing all kinds of memories the family has at one house As it says in the memoir, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. It's saying that a house is a house and it doesn't mean much to people and anyone can go there. But a home is where you live, is where you grow up and have all the memories, it's just a better place"	2	2		2																					
3751	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1"" by The Blueprints of Our lives, the mood created by the author is happyness.The mood in the memoir was happyness. It because the mother showed he how to love people. Quote she said... Always filled the air with not just scent an music but life and love. It was there I learned the real difinition of ""family."" That many family is just not the people you love and not being a blood relative. I like when her mom let anybody to there household to the table.In the mood that created by the author is happyness in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez."	2	2		2

He shows this by talking about how his surrogate grandparents lived in the basement and he didn't know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba.

When I hear about someone being that @CAPS1 it makes me think how times have changed from whe Narciso was growing up in the @NUM1's. He was so greatful and happy when compaired to now he has nothing. But he was abel to show all his gratude with the deepest heart warming simpathyall in all @CAPS2 learned from his parents and knew that family was the most important thing you can have.	2	2		2

The mood of this piece is graciousness and happiness. He is gracious towards his parents for being courageous and making them a home. Durring this piece he is happy that his parents were brave and came to @LOCATION1, that is why this memior also has a happy mood.	2	2		2																					
3757	5	The mood is very warm and welcoming. It starts off with a beautiful and culturally enriched apartment. Then talks about delicious foods and great music. But at the end it leaves off on a sadder tone of her parents leaving to make a better life.	1	2		2

And makes us portra a peaceful setting."	1	2		2																					
3759	5	"The mood  in the memoir could be many things the one that really stands out to me though is grateful. One way how @CAPS1 shows this is @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice @CAPS1 is so thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 could live a wonderful life.Another way @CAPS1 shows @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 respects what her gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents lives were.The last way @CAPS1 shows gratefulness is @CAPS1 thanks her parents every day for what they have done. ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her.

3762	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our Lives"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created in the memoir is a comfortable one. I know this because in paragraph three it says ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative"" That shows that he was comfortable in that house and neighborhood that he had developed a family other than his blood relatives. Also in the last sentence of this memoir it says ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home.""

The mood in which the author includes in the memoir is described her Narciso Rodriguez."	2	2		2																					
3768	5	"The mood described in this memoir is mostly about love, unity, and culture. In love he shows that his parents immigrated mostly to give his children a better future. This is described in paragraph @NUM1.In unity it shows that in their neighborhood most of the immigrants were always having feasts and being really close to each other. This is explained in paragraph @NUM2 where it says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."".

3771	5	they'd sald what little furniture they'd possessed by then	0	1		1																					
3772	5	The mood created by the author is touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm & segregation prevailed in the United States. Also b/c he had to share a house with alot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially & his parents couldn't find a jobs. That's why I think the mood is touching.	1	2		2																					
3773	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is the begining of the memoir he tells how his parents had a hard time coming to another country and having to deal with allot of problem and the mood is really sad or with allot of suspense and by the middle of the memoir he talks about how he grown up in a family that everbody was so happy and live most everbody together and they had allots of feast and that mood changed to a more happy mood or joyfull mood that he had with his family, and by the end he talks about he thank his parents for the person that he is and all the opportunities they give him and that change the mood to a thankful mood or a grateful mood. And that is how the author creates all the moods on the memoir.	2	3		3																					
3774	5	"The mood created by the author was mostly happiness and thankfulness. Narciso's parents came to the @LOCATION1 with courage without any knowledge of the language nor culture. Narciso feels thankful and graceful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. During the whole memoir, the designer is happy. He explained about how peaceful and grateful his... life with his ""family"" was by keeping is Cuban culture and heritage. The author said that the sense of family had nothing to do with being a blood relative. For paragraph @NUM1 and @DATE1, the mood was pretty sad because Narciso described what hardships his parents had to go through to come to the @LOCATION1. He said I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. During the whole memoir, the author describes how much he honors his parents such as how they not only told him life lessons but also showed him. Narciso Rodriguez ended the story with a happy mood by stating he loves his parents for everything they have done for him overall, this memoir had a variety of different moods at certain times depending on what the author was talking about. But mostly, the author was GRATEFUL."	3	3		3																					
3775	5	In the memoir the author creates a homey mood. he shows us the smells and tastes of the food, he shows love from his parents, and he shows grattitude for what he has.	1	1		1																					
3776	5	The mood created by the author was to me appreshiation, and some sympathy. Heres @NUM1 people that gave up their home, job, family, friends in the hope that they can live a better life with their son in @LOCATION1. I have lots of appreshiation because its just another example to show how much our parents love and want the best fer us. I feel some-what bad fer the parents because they came from Cuba, and moved to @LOCATION1. They didn't know the language, they had to learn everything over, and look for a job that would take imagrants. Most jobs dont take imagrents, so the parents had to work hard to support their son. The love and detication that our parents put in to give us the best is unbelievable. The mood set was appreshiation and simpathy for the people in this story.	2	3		3																					
3777	5	The mood in this memoir can be described as anything happy. The author sets a real nostalgic feel about happy memories in the memoir. One of the memories is the kitchen. Rodriguez describes the room as a very peaceful place with music and traditional Cuban food. He says he remembers them and still loves them to this day. He also recalls his freinds and naybors that he used to have over. Even during a time of @CAPS1.S.A racism, the freinds still found ways to make them all happy and all got a long. Another fond memory he re-calls is his parents teaching him life lessons. He says that his parents were scientists back in cuba but moved to @LOCATION1 in order to have a better home. This taught him a lesson that family can matter more then money. Through these fond memories, Rodriguez says that he finds the true deffinition of family.	3	3		3																					
3778	5	"The mood that the author, Narciso Rodriguez, created in the memoir was a feeling of unity and happiness. He explained his life, home, family, and parents. He said that, ""family"", was a great thing in that he learned the real definition. He said that he is most grateful for his caring and selfnassless parents. Narisco wrote about how you don't have to be a blood relative, to be family. He said that he is also grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. He said they showed him their lives and those teachings have been the basis of his life. He talked about his culture and how the heart of his home is his kitchen. He loves cooking and his parents taught him how to cook. He also said that in his neighborhood, cultures came together and there was unity and friendship. That was the mood created by the author in the memoir."	4	2		3																					
3779	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about the meaning of family. Narciso Rodriguez is grateful to have such wonderful parents and that they immagrated to @LOCATION1. He seems to speak in a happy and thankful tone.	1	1		1																					
3780	5	"The mood created by the author was one of happiness, love, and caring. Not only does it show in his style, but the author also gives details that really create the vibe. In paragraph @NUM1, the author describes the food as ""rich culinary skills and love of cooking,"" and the music as ""passionate Cuban music...mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This creates a homely affect to the scene, along with the paragraph about the many ""family members"" that came over for meals. The author describes this and explains that this was all possible, despite the nation's racism, because his parents worked hard to get where they were for the faith that their children would have a better life than they had. With all of the details, the author creates a loving, cultural affect can only be found with great family and friends."	3	3		3																					
3781	5	Happiness is the mood described in the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez. Shown throughout the memoir that he is happy about the choice that his Parents had to make for him. The outcome of that is success. Also an example of one time the writer has shown happiness about his parents are the culture that he comes from showing that he is cuban and that he is proud to be what he is. As in the memoir says both his parents had come to america away from their good life to give more opportunities to their child. They had lost their Jobs and didn't know where to go, had no @CAPS1, But they were willing to do anything so it would benefit their child. The writer is very grateful for that because if that didn't happen he wouldn't be here, so appreciating everything his parents did for him this shows some of the things going on in his life.	2	3		3																					
3782	5	"The author creates a mood that he is very greatful to his parents. His parents taught him how to cook in a Cuban-style, (wich he loves to cook). ""(and for wich I am eternally greatful)."" His main greatfullness, is of their love and sacrifise. They would take in someone who needed time to get back on their feet, wich he found amazing. ""I will allways be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And he is not affraid to let them know, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repetedly."" @CAPS1 the memoir, the auther creates a mood that he is greatful to all his parents love and sacrifices, not only to himself, but to everyone they've helped."	3	2		3																					
3783	5	I feel like there is one main mood which is thankfulness made up of many different moods. The other moods are reminisceance and hapiness. Thankfulness is focused on in paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2. Narciso Rodriguez talks about thankful he is his parents gave up so much to come to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He also talks about how his parents taught him how important family and friends were. He showed reminiscence by talking about what his house was like and what the people who made up the house were like. Lastly happiness which is mostly his mood when he remineses his past and family. Those are the moods of his meimor.	3	2		3																					
3784	5	"In this memoir about @PERSON1 the reader learns alot about the @CAPS1 by the mood (or tone) of the memoir. The mood of this memoir is greatful, because he is thinking of all the opportunities he got to have since his parents were so caring and selfless.     In the memor the reader learns that parent makes so many sacrifices for their children that helping around the house and thanking them is the least they can do.      In conclusion the mood in the memoir Home: The @CAPS2 prints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez is, happy, and greatful because of the sacrifices made by his parents. A good citation for this is ""even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."""	2	3		3																					
3785	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir was admiration. First of all @CAPS2 felt proud of his parents because they share ""Cooking duties and the work around the house."" @CAPS1 of all @CAPS2 felt @CAPS3 of knowing cuban background and @CAPS2 was proud because his parents were cuban. @CAPS2 was very admire by his parents because @CAPS2 was proud of being cuban two. These is the mood created by the author in the momoir."	1	2		2																					
3786	5	The author creates a loving, and caring mood. He makes it feel that you too could be invited into their home with open arms. That if you are feeling down they would pick you right up with a warm meal and a cozzy bead. He describes that they left Cuba to come to the land of oppertunities. That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1.	2	1		2																					
3787	5	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, it gives a cheery, happy safe mood. Paragraph @NUM1 explains a traditional cuban home, with the cooking and music and everything. It's like that in my house, just with @CAPS1 things, not Cuban. Also, the narrator explains how everyone in the neighborhood was a close - knit family of Cuban, spanish and Italian people. No one would hurt one other and every one will help in case of a problem, giving a safe feeling. Lastly, All of paragraph @NUM2 and @NUM3 explains how his parents risked everything to be in the @CAPS2. My parents did the same thing and it makes me feel happy that they did. So, its probably the same for the narrator. In conclusion, the memoir has a good and happy mood to it.	3	2		3																					
3788	5	the mood created by the author in the memoir was mutule in the begining it was about move to a New contrey they did seem faced by it they were more into giveing there child a better life and in the end it really sounds like they were all happy they welcomed people that moved from somwhere els into there home and welcomed them I think overall it was a happy mood that was created by the author	2	1		2																					
3789	5	"The mood created @CAPS1 the author in the memoir was grateful and loving. In one of the paragraphs, Narciso said, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice."" @CAPS1 saying this, @CAPS2 is saying that @CAPS2 is grateful that his parents would give up their lives as they knew it for him. @CAPS2 said that @CAPS2 learned the real definition of ""family."" @CAPS2 knows that members in a family would give up anything to help another member of the family. @CAPS2 also said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" His family helped create a good home with love."	2	2		2																					
3790	5	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is very happy. The mood is happy because all you read are good things @CAPS1 put you in a good. one example is ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 means to me that any one can be your family."	1	1		1																					
3791	5	"I think the overall mood created by the author, is comfort. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, the author writes, ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" the author tries to set the scene and give the reader a good sense of what growing up in his home was like.Also, the fact that they took relatives in and helped them get their lives back together again is comforting. In paragraph @NUM2, he writes, ""Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" the family knew that their family would do the same for them if they ever needed somewhere to stay.Finally, the amount of love and caring in the house is very strong. Paragraph @NUM3 is all about how much the author cares about his parents and is very grateful to them. the comforting sense of a home is very important to Narciso Rodriguez, the author, and also his very large family."	2	2		2																					
3792	5	"The author's mood was wondering and near the end, it changed you happiness. I thought the mood was wondering at first because he was wondering what ""home"" was all about. Then, it was changed to happiness because now the author knew what ""home"" is all about."	1	1		1																					
3793	5	The @CAPS1 is writing in first person narrative. The @CAPS2 sets a tone with and about How he is so proud of his cuban relationship and haritage. He is also very happy and proud about how he has great parents and a great house and very very fund memories of all these things. He also explains and talks about other people and how it was hard to leave cuba and come to america. That is how the @CAPS1 sets the tone for this story.	2	2		2																					
3794	5	The mood in this memoir is happy. I think the mood is happy because Narciso Rodriguez was greatful for mostley everything in his life. In Narciso's neighborhood in the @CAPS1 Came together in great solidarity and friendship. All though they had were diffrent cultures.	1	1		1																					
3795	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", what is the mood created by the author?The mood that the authors creates while writing this passage is very cultural like. Because she reason is. That he uses good detail in decribing the home of the character. For example, @CAPS1 Cuban music (which I adore to this day). This shows that there was some beautifull cultural music.Another way is that he is in a cultral mood is when he says. ""My young parents created our traditional cuban home."" This shows that they took what they had in Cuba and brang it to @LOCATION1. Also that they wanted it to be like home in which they miss.In this memoir there @MONTH1 have been other ways to describe the mood of what the author created. But I think the cultral mood is one of the bigger ones. Thats what I showed you in these two paragraphs."	1	2		2																					
3796	5	A house is not a home without family, and a family is not a family without its trails, struggles, and happiness. The mood in the memoir was to show what family is, that its much more than blood. It's unity, friendship and laughter, its the tears, pain and heartache. Its about how you can start in the slums and work your way up but one thing is never going to change, and that's family. Home doesnt matter about the physical space of the dwelling, but about the relationships and memories you make there. Home is where unity, satisfaction, happpness, and imagination come together in one unorganized way, but it doesnt mean that it won't have trails like racism that almost every minority has to deal with even Narciso Rodriguez dealt with it. I deal with it to, I get called cracker and n**** on a daily baised, I dont know how I would get through it without family.	2	2		2																					
3797	5	"The author in this memoir created a mood that showed how @CAPS1 felt about this house and his parents. He appreciated the house and was grateful for his parents. He is grateful for his parents and for their love and sacrifice. He is grateful they love and care for him. He says, ""I've often told them what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 appreciates this house and how his parents made it into a home. He appreciates how his parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family.So in this memoir the author created a mood that showed greatfulness and appreciation."	2	2		2

3799	5	The author of this memoir put a mood to it. The mood of this is very loving, because the parents gave everything to make their child's life easier. There is also a very friendly and caring feeling for because the article says how their neighborhood is mostly immigrants and that they are a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants extended their hands to people well in need. I would say all the moods in this memoir is loving, caring, friendship, and equality.	2	2		2																					
3800	5	In the memoir the mood created by the author is the mood of happiness and appritiation. This has the mood of happiness because it just fills you with happiness to know the everyone can be one big family no matter what race and having realized that anyone can be family even if their not a blood relative. This memoir gives you the feeling of appritiation because it makes you appritiate what you have and appritiate having any kind of family. Also just to have everyone united as one and be thankful for my culture and it kind of makes me want to explore my culture and express it more.	1	2		2																					
3801	5	The mood that the author was trying to show was calm. I think thats what he was trying to show because Narciso is talking about his family and when he was growing up. Narciso also talked about what kinds of things happened at his house when he was a kid. One thing he talked about was how his landlords daughter was his first babysitter and first friend. He also talked about how his parents showed him thier cooking skills and thier passion for cooking.	2	1		2																					
3802	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is great @CAPS1. Narciso loved to cook. ""A love of cooking that is still with me today."" Narciso loved his parents very much. ""I will always be grateful to my parents For their love and sacrifice."" The Rodriguez family help people come into ther house hold. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country"". This was the mood created by the author in the memoir."	2	3		3																					
3803	5	In this memoir, Narciso talks about how it was hard to be raised by immagrant parents in @LOCATION1, getting cruddy jobs for low pay, but his home is his home, where all of his memories are. In my opinion, his mood is happy, and joyful, based on how much he talks about his home.	2	1		2																					
3804	5	"The author created a mood in The memoir. The auThor use a mood of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The memoir. The auThor showed This by ""alegrai graced our kitchen table more often Than noT."" This shows That The auThor used a mood oF @CAPS1 @CAPS2 The memoir"	1	1		1																					
3805	5	"Narciso Rodriguez by Narciso Rodriguez is a memoir from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives and it is about Narciso Rodriguez's early life. The major mood in the memoir is honesty and truthfulness. This is because the author talks about that you don't want to hear or that makes you sad to hear. For example, the author tells us about racism and how it was normal in the United States but the community overcame it: ""a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close � knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"" (@NUM1). In conclusion, the mood of the memoir is honesty and truthfulness because the author tells us about things that might make us uncomfortable."	3	3		3																					
3806	5	"The mood in this memoir I believe  is appreciation and caring towards others. @NUM1 home as well as neighborhood was a place of unity and caring for one another like a family. In the memoir it says that people were always coming in and out of the house for a place to stay or for a meal to eat and were always welcomed with open arms. ""Family""  to him didn't mean you were related but were loved and cared for by other and with that mindset he had a huge family. His parent left behind their lives in Cuba where they were both scientists and had friends and family there for their son. They knew that the United States had better oppurtunitis for Narciso (in which he becomes a designer). He states several times how grateful he is of his parents for them to move to the @LOCATION3 for him as well as making his house feel like a home."	3	3		3																					
3807	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is. First, the moon that I think is a warm and and saying there's no place like home feeling. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 it states all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship as in home and and the people around us is like family and we come and unit as friends and families. Also Narciso Rodriguez says in paragraph @NUM2 ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. To finish my describtion of the mood created by the author in this memoir of Narciso Rodriguez theres no place like to feel at home."	2	2		2																					
3808	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our Lives the overall mood of the author is greatfulness. Narciso begins the memoir by telling us how much @CAPS3 appreciates his culture and all that his parents do for him In paragraph @NUM1, ""... And unwittenly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking... (For which I am eternally greatful)"" @CAPS3 has an optemistic outlook on every aspect of his family and his culture. Most of it had to do with how @CAPS3 grew up and was born into a family who had just finished their hardships of getting int @LOCATION1."	2	2		2																					
3809	5	The mood was a little sad at certian times and greatful at others. It was sade that they have to leave Cuba and start all over agin. It was greatful becase they hade family that loved them and cared for them.	1	1		1																					
3810	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was grateful, happy, and thankful. The author was grateful because he wasn't asked to be born in america, hes parents immigranted to america so that Narciso can live a better life. Narciso was happy because he get to see both of his parents, his grandparents which lives in the basement of his house, and his aunts Bertha and Juanita and his cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary. Narciso was thankful because he gets a home where he can sleep at, a family who loves him, and he could've ask for nothing better than the life he has now.	1	1		1																					
3811	5	"The mood of the memoir is appreciation. I think it's this mood because in the final paragraph the author says, ""... I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS1 fact is, in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 talks about how he kept thanking his parents for everything he had. He states, ""I've often told them that what they did is a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" I guess he is just very grateful for his parents, his childhood, everything and everyone he has ever met, had or done in his life. If I were in his shoes, I'd be grateful, too. This opened my eyes and now, I, too, am grateful for everything and everyone I have in my life."	2	3		3																					
3812	5	The mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is very sensative way. And what I mean by that in paragrap @NUM1 and @NUM2 it sound's like the @CAPS1 is getting real emotional. It say's in paragraph @NUM1 I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and scrifice.	1	1		1

In the last sentence Narciso says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."", what this means is that he is greatful for the life he had. So he will never forget the gratitude that fills him up inside."	2	2		2

They would sacrafice having the jobs that they deserved. They immigrated to @LOCATION1 to give their children a better life.

His parents came to the country knowing little engish and having to start their lives over just so that his life would be better."	2	2		2																					
3818	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is emotional. The mood is emotional because his family left ther homeland for the freedom of ther children. They gave up everthing including family for the kids. The fact that they didn't know anybody or the town itself was amazing. Jobs were few, money was sarce.

3820	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I believe he goes from a calm mood to a proud mood. He starts off describing his life so far and family. How he used to live in a one-room apartment in Cuba and how his family lives in Newark, New Jersey along with other Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immagrints. Then he talks about the neighborhood and how together are great solidarity and friendships. Also, a honest and hard working community mostly immagrints. He also said, ""I will always be grateful to my for their love and sacrifice."" (paragraph @NUM1) I think Narciso feel thankful and proud to be a Cuban and have such wonderful parents.

In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will never foreget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" That sentence indicates how much he Loved his parents for doing that. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" that indicates how apriciative he was.

3825	5	"The mood created by the author is welcoming. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. ""In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family.

""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"" (paragraph @NUM1). Narciso's parents cared about everybody as if they were part of the family. Another reason the mood is love is because Narciso talks about how his parents were selfless. With courage they moved to @LOCATION1 without knowledge of the lanunguage or the culture.""

3831	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a grateful one. Because it is telling you what his experience in life was, and what his parents were like. It is also my opinion that they liked where they were. One reason is because they liked to cook all the time. Another reason is that they liked to have fun with their son One last reason is because they had a son. Their @CAPS1 name was @PERSON1.	1	1		1																					
3832	5	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is happy and grateful. In ph. @NUM1, Narciso's parents gave up all they had to leave Cuba and come to @LOCATION1 where their children could have a better life. Narciso was so grateful to them that he couldn't express a thank you in words in ph. @NUM2. In ph. @NUM2, it also states that he is really grateful for his parent's love and sacrifice. The reason he is happy, I think is because he has a family that loves him. Even though they're from different cultures they came together and that wouldn't have happened if his parents hadn't immigrated. That is why I think the mood is happy and truely grateful."	2	2		2																					
3833	5	The mood created by the author is welcoming and warm. The author makes it so that you want to be @CAPS1 and being able to smell the good food. Also just being able to appreciate the cuban culture.	1	2		2																					
3834	5	The mood in the memoir is basicly showing love, happiness, and friendship. The way that the mood shows love is in @CAPS1 @NUM1 and @NUM2. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 is says Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 it talks about how his parent welcome refugees to celebrate their arrival to @LOCATION1. Happiness was shown throughout the story. And friendship was shown as well The way that friendship was shown by his parents keeping their door open to whom who did not have a home. But let them stay in their home until their back on he or she is back on there feet, and considerd part of the family.	2	2		2																					
3835	5	"This memoir creates a peacefull mood. It is telling us of his childhood. Narciso writes, ""In 1961 I was born into this simple house,"". As a child you have nothing but peace. He had many visitors. He writes ""my mother took in refug is welcoming them into the country"". He obviously had a nice enviornment with all those visitors. He is explaining his past. He loves his house and the enviornment it creates. He writes ""I will never forget how my parents turned that simple house into a home,"". It just put your mind at ease. That is how this article creates a peace ful mood"	2	3		3																					
3836	5	The mood that was created by the author in this memoir is being happy. The author is happy how Where she use to live she left there to move to @LOCATION1, and made it feel just like home instead of looking back and thinking no place could ever take my real home. The author was positive about this memoir.	1	1		1																					
3837	5	In the memoir, the author creates the feeling that everyone in the neighborhood treated each other as family, though they were all struggling to get buy. They were all struggling immigrants who had sacrificed a lot. Narciso's parents had highly skilled well paying jobs in Cuba and they were forced to get whatever jobs they could find in @LOCATION2. They would always help someone in their family if necesary, and often did. Narciso's family made the best of being poor, and managed to get by. They did all this without loosing their culture (Cuban music and food). Their entire neighborhood, one big family, survived and thrived on little. Being a blood relative wasn't the only defenition of family in their part of Newark, New Jersey.	2	2		2																					
3838	5	"In the memoir, @ORGANIZATION1 the mood created @ORGANIZATION1 the @CAPS3 is hard and happy.The first place in the story when the @CAPS3 creates a hard mood is when they say that racism is overt. ""Spanish, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 immigrants overt racism"". this show that the mood is hard because we know that at that time racism was occurring so that made it hard for them to fit in with everybody else.The last place in the story were the author creates a happy mood is when the neighborhood came together. ""In our neighborhood, despite custom elsewhere, all these cultures came together and great solidarity and friendship"". This displays a happy mood because is represents a whole bunch of diffrent people comming together to work together.As you can see @CAPS3 creates two different types of moods hard, and happy."	3	2		3																					
3839	5	"@ORGANIZATION1 tells the story of his childhood and the feel good-times of his ""family"" in a small house in Newark. Rodriguez shares a unique happy feeling with this excerpt; the feeling of great memories that have been strengthened with each day. The phrases he uses to help describe the house like ""passionate Cuban music filled the air"" and ""the congregation of family"" established this vibrant and happy feeling of the welcoming household he grew up in. The excerpt furthers these feelings when the author tells about how much his parents gave when they themselves had little of their own. The description of these selfless attitudes and ways helps paint a beautiful portrait of a family, with ""extended family"" also, forgetting their troubles and enjoying every second they spend together in a lively kitchen. As the author goes on to tell how grateful he is for his parents and wonderful, warm childhood, it provides a serene and a down-to-earth honesty from the author. The excerpt recreates a feel good time of a carefree life and worryless days that provide a wonderful atmosphere for the reader."	3	3		3																					
3840	5	the @CAPS1 mood was good he have spicecfic details and told were he was from how his parents were ect.	1	1		1																					
3841	5	The mood the author creates is the sadness of living one country where freinds and family lived. To happiness of the times they've shared in the United States. As the memoir states the center of the home was the kitchen where here parents split cooking duties and where passionate Cuban music filled the air the the kitchen's aroma. In the kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their hope of creating a better life for the family even if it meant leaving their country, freinds, and family behind. The author also creates a mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister. These are the moods the author creates throughout the memoir.	2	3		3																					
3842	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is they had no problem finding a house. for example the author states ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally greatful)."" This means that they are great cooks and have skills for cooking. ""Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us."" Even though they first came to the @CAPS1. S they had no problem finding a home. ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays."" This is saying his mom keeps the traditions with all the celebrations for new comers to the @LOCATION1"	3	3		3																					
3843	5	In this memoir, I think the mood created is very peaceful, happy, and homely. Narciso Rodriguez describes in detail how selfless his parent were, As the left their entire lifes behind in Cuba togive their Children a better life in @LOCATION1. Their home was almost a sanctuary. Warm, full of Cuban heritage, cooking and music. Family members always around, visiting frequently for dinner. A safe and secure place to grow up in, in my opinion. After reading this memoir I had a warm feeling inside of me, and I began to think of places like my home which make me feel in this way. Narciso was a very lucky boy to be brought up this way.	2	3		3																					
3844	5	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 is very cozy and welcomeing. Inside the @PERSON1 home the @CAPS1 describes a cozy and friendly atmospher. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed bot, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"". This quote shows how cozy or ""warm"" their home is. In the memoir he also explains how welcome people are and that everyone in the Apartment building was friends or even family! ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me the great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This quote means that in his welcomeing home friends were also concidered his family. Narciso Rodriguez had a wonderful @CAPS2 to grow up in."	2	3		3																					
3845	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir."	3	2		3																					
3846	5	The mood that is described in this story is love. Why did I pick love? I picked love because in the story it says a lot of stuff about family and Cuba and home (Cuba, is where the love (family) is. In this story is states that his love comes from his family and love comes from every family and @PERSON1's loves his family he says it alot in the story.	1	1		1																					
3847	5	In this memoir the mood that was created was security and warmth. I say this because throughout his story he talks about how grateful he is to have parents who cared about him so much they moved to the United States to give him a better life than what he would have had in Cuba. Narciso constantly talks about the food that his mom used to make and has taught him. The unity that the neighborhood has formed. When he was young there was still a lot of racism and segragation from whites to other races and because of that his neighborhood was the only place to feel at home and feel like they didn't have to prove anything. Their house was permanently open to whoever needed it, and his parents would feed and be overall kind to them. This memoir is about Narciso Rodriguez's kind and loving family, and that comes off strongly in his story.	2	3		3																					
3848	5	"The author creates many different moods throughout the memoir. In the beginning, the author talks about his traditional Cuban home, in which he feels extremely comfortable and safe. Here, he creates a mood of warmth, and a very family oriented upbringing, all positively. Around paragraph @NUM1, the author begins to talk about his pride in the success and determination of his family. For example, (paragraph @NUM1, final sentence) ""The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them. (his parents) to endure these hard times."" This gives a mood of pride and great triumph. That is the mood that @PERSON1 gives in the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives."""	2	3		3																					
3849	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a verry happy tone. The reasons that its a happy tone is because @CAPS1 tells about her Childhood hapily by talking about the unity of his invirorment and the happiiness, cuban food, and Cuban music that filled his home and that still fills his home today because he injoyes it so much.	2	1		2																					
3850	5	"In the memoir there is alot of differet moods such as mad, sad, hopefull. I think that over all it is a happy memoir because in the story is says ""and for which I am eternally gratefull"". and also ""Which I adored to this day."" @CAPS1 I think that over all it is a happy mood, because there is alot of evidence to help support it."	1	1		1																					
3851	5	The mood in the memoir, which the author is trying to show you is pretty much the happiness and gratefullness that Narciso Rodriguez has to be cuban. Narciso is bringing the mood of happiness in this memoir learning all about his Cuban background and how much he is greatful for his mom and dad. The author is trying to show you appriciation and gratefulness. This whole memoir is trying to show readers how great it is to come from different cultures and know how to make and do different things. This memoir is representing good moods and happiness. To always be grateful for what you have in you life, exspecially your family, friends, & your life. The mood in this memoir is very happy and gratefull	2	2		2																					
3852	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso @CAPS1"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives the author creates a very powerful and posative mood. One strong example of this is how he expresses his parents. He implies the mood they set on him by saying things like ""always be greatful for my parents"",  ""admiration for their strength"", ""perseverance"", and ""generosity."" The mood Narciso used to express his family was very positive and thankful. Another example of the mood the author sets is what he thinks of his culture. He tells that his family and friends are immigrants and how hard they worked to be free and give a better life to their families and children. The struggle and hard work his family went through to keep their culture alive; Narciso was very thankful for. He was extremely proud of his culture and thankful for the example his family had set. Narciso Rodriguez expresses a very positive and powerful mood about his family and his culture throughout the excerpt."	3	3		3																					
3853	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our loves the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid-back mood.The way the author writes is very smooth for example ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence.He then goes on about his life. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for.The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and layed back."	1	1		1																					
3854	5	The author, Narciso Rodriguez, created a ceartain mood in his memoir. That certain mood was love and family. The reason why love and family is the moood is because of the following reasons. Family is the mood because the author starts out by saying that family had nothing to do with blood realitives. It is also because everyone even if they weren't related was labeled as cousin, aunt, uncle, grandma, grandpa etc. Another reason that it is family is because that is what he felt every one was to him. A reason that it is love is because he loved everyone in his family. They always came over and had dinner babysat him and every thing that is why it is love.	2	2		2																					
3855	5	As I read the article, also called memoir, I didn't so much find a certain mood that the author had created. This memoir is indeed heart warming and touching, though it is very inspirational. It teaches, at least it taught me, that if you can dream something then you can do it. Narciso's parents most likely did dream of coming to america to raise a family and they accomplished with a little hope and hard work. If I had to say what mood this author created I would say happiness. The reason for that is because Narciso was not rich in the sense of money but rich in the sense of love, happiness, and family cultures. For example, as this article said, his parents had a talent for cooking which was passed down to Narciso and he was grateful. Another example is that he was filled with joy and happiness just because of who is family and neighbors were and how he spent his life living around them.	3	3		3																					
3856	5	"The author of the memoir set a mood in the writting. The mood of thankfullness and humbleness was set in the writting piece. The word greatful was repeated over and over again. Since the author emphasized the word it gives a reader an idea that he truley is thankful for his parents and childhood. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" this is an example of the author showing his graditude towards his parents. While reading this peice it gave me a warm feeling. Even though the author's parents had a hard time when they moved to @LOCATION1 they gave the author a good childhood with happy memories. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This is how the author looks at his memories. They are always cheerful and warm. In the last sentence of the memoir he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that he is grateful for having so many good relationships with lots of people and that it didn't matter how small their house was the author's parents help brought it to life, and for that he is grateful."	3	2		3																					
3857	5	He is very greatfull to live in @LOCATION1 and even with all the racism he still found ways to have fun and enjoy life.	1	1		1																					
3858	5	The @CAPS1 created by the @CAPS2 is happy, @CAPS3 was happy that @CAPS3 got to live in @LOCATION2 and be raised in @LOCATION2.@CAPS3 happy because shes lived In the Same house in New Jersey all her life then finally got to meet her grandparents In 1970 When @CAPS3 turned @NUM1 years old.@CAPS3 Is also happy because @CAPS3 Is older and has alot of memorys In the house and Is happy @CAPS3 lives In a free country.	1	2		2																					
3859	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home."	3	3		3																					
3860	5	"A happy, grateful, and proud mood is expressed by the author in this memoir. The author, Narciso, expressed a grateful and happy mood by describing things his parents did for him that he was grateful for, as well as happy to have.

Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) The author also expressed his pride in the story, by stating and describingwhat his parent's did that he was proud of. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships.""

For example in paragraph @NUM1: ""I've told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" @CAPS1 will never forget his home. For example from paragraph @NUM3: ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" The mood was very happy.

These imagrents do not have a lot to work with. They live in small homes that are durty but in a suprizing way the manage.

Over all I think the mood is happy.	2	2		2

Narcisco goes on to say how her parents were ways welcoming and inviting and how they sacrificied basically their whole life so they could make a better life for their children. In the final paragraphs the author expresses pure graditutity for everything her parents have given up and done. In one line Rodriguez praises parents when she thanks them again saying, ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.""

In the passage in paragraph @NUM1, it explains how the families are close and help those in need, even wheN things arent going so soomthly for them. Also there are certain words in the passage that would help with the mood, words such as selflessly, solidary, love, friendship, and sacrifice. In my opinion, this words help bring the mood to a happy, calming feeling to the passage. The ""happy"" mood is created by the authoR in this memoiR."	2	2		2

This is how the author discribes The @CAPS1 in This @CAPS9."	3	3		3																					
3894	5	The mood in the memoir is happy and thankful. I think this because the memoir is talking about how this boy apreshiates that his parents moved just so he can have a better life. I know this because in the last paragraph the boy talks about his family and how he will never forget how his parents turned a simple house to a home. So thats the mood of the memoir.	2	1		2																					
3895	5	"In the memoir, the author created a mood. The mood was a very good one that shows everyone that reads it, that the human race can be genuinely kind and helpful. No matter what race you are or where you come from, you don't have to be blood related to be ""family"" and we can all extend a hand to the people that need the most help. The author's parents gave him great love and sacrificed alot for him; @CAPS1 is very thankful to them for that. @CAPS1 tells them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then @CAPS1 could've ever done and @CAPS1 has great admiration for their strength and perseverance. Being an immagrant you have to be unselfish because most parents do it to give their children a better life. The author learned the real definition of ""family"" and for that, @CAPS1 said @CAPS1'll never forget that house or the many things about how to love. In the memoir, it creates a peaceful mood."	3	2		3																					
3896	5	The mood created by the arthur in the memoir is to never forget what home is if you ever move away or you grow up and you move. its okay because you will have better memories there at your new house and also if you have the nastest house, you can always make it into the cleanest house it just takes time, and effort.

To wrap it all up, the mood the author created in the memoir was about love and happiness."	3	3		3																					
3898	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives the author leaves a friendly, compassionate, and graceful mood. This excerpt leaves a friendly mood because of how much friendlyness is given by Narciso Rodriguez neighborhood at his younge age' In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and frienship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Also this excerpt leaves a compassionate mood because of how much compassion Narciso's parents showed to familys of friends who need a push or help to stand on their feet once again. ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone stying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) Rodriguez leaes a grateful mood when he continues to thank his parents for their love. ""I will always be greater to my parents for their love and sacrifize... Admiration for their strength and perseverance.. and these teachings have been the basic of my life. Rodriguez uses these wonderful moods to describe his wonderful parents."	3	3		3																					
3899	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is one that is used in lots of memoirs because they are like thing's: someone will never forget like the author said ""my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally gratefull). Passionate cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. That's all stuff that he will never forget."	2	1		2																					
3900	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting. The mood created by the author is lifting because it shows that race doesn't matter when it comes to unity or friendship. It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so that their family can live a better life. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how the family doesn't have to neccisarily blood related and can be someone you love and will help you. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting.	2	2		2

There can be a lot of drama in a family, but @PERSON1 his backround and how much he loves his family and the people in his neighborhood. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" In the first paragraph Narciso @PERSON1 how he tackes in his culture. I says, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" Narciso @PERSON1 love and gratefulness in this excerpt, ""Narciso Rodriguez""."	2	2		2																					
3903	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was grateful in the beginning of his memoir. Evidence from the text that supported this is paragraph @NUM1 it stated ""(and for which I am eternally grateful.)""The second mood created by the author in the memoir is that he was thankful. He was thankful because his parants were immigrants and came to the country without knowing any language or the cultureThe last mood created by the author in the memoir was that he felt loved. He felted loved because his parents sacrifice for him. They welcomed many things in Narciso life. those are three moods that were created by the author in the memoir"	2	3		3																					
3904	5	The mood the author created was a good mood. It is a good mood because it is telling you about his life he has. He has a good life because he has good and nice parents. He is wealthy. He has no trouble like getting punished. His parents are wealthy and they have a good job. The author did a good job make this story happy and not sad.	1	1		1																					
3905	5	"The mood in the @ORGANIZATION1 is displayed as happieness and appreciation. Narciso understands how much his parents had given up for him by moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. They also have always stood by his side and made sure there was only positive attitudes around him. He appreciates this so much he ends the @ORGANIZATION1 saying ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". by this he is saying it was a house that could shelter you, but a home is somewhere you want to be with family where you feel safe and comfortable. The happieness comes from the appreciation because you cant appreciat something and it doesn't make you make a little bit happier. his happieness is also portrayed in paragraph @NUM1 where he starts by saying ""I will always be greatfull to my parents for their love and sacrifice""."	3	3		3																					
3906	5	The mood created by the author, @PERSON1, is a upbeat & happy mood. I know this because he states that he is very grateful for his parents to pass down the cooking recipes and skills, and the Cuban music that they would listen to.This is the mood @PERSON1 creates in the memoir.	2	2		2																					
3907	5	The mood in the memoir, that the author is trying to @CAPS1 you is. That it is calm, and in its own way the mood Kind of leads to forgiveness and @CAPS2. Because the memoir is mostly trying to tell you that no matter where you go you never forget about your family. And that the memories are much better then the reality that you live in. And no matter how far you deciede to go, to a different Country. Never forget who gave you birth. And who loves you. Which really means family. And friends. But the @CAPS3 That they describe in the @CAPS4. He decieds to leave his family to go to america and to get an education. And do something big with his life. And he is going through other things to like, the other People are thinking of him as a immagrant. And how the rest of the family @CAPS5 leave there @CAPS6. But the family to them that really didnt mean anything to them. In there house they left there door open to any family that needs help, or that there going through the same thing as what their family is going through. So thats the mood that the author is trying to describe to you.	1	1		1																					
3908	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives the aurthor displays a mood. The mood is very calm and grateful as he explains how he feels to have his cuban culture and lifestyle. Explaining how his family loves cooking and playing music. The author just explains how he lived when he was with his parents. Then the author gets more detailed talking about who lived with him like his landlord and his daughter; his two granparents and others. The author just creates a calm and grateful mood to this memoir.	2	2		2																					
3909	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is a specific mood created. The mood is proud, because the author goes on about how amazing their parents are & how inviting the house was. In the memoir it says, ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" The author talks about how his/her home was full of Cuban culture and how great Cuban food is. The author also says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative... In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.""

3910	5	The mood of the story is happy. Everyone spend time with their family, having fun together, celebrating together would give you a happy feeling of what a family is. It's like how the family in the story moved to the United States, they first doesn't know anyone, they haver no friends. They are living in an apartment that has one room, but years later, they moved to a @NUM1-room apartment. There live a family with a borned baby above them. the baby is the job for the main character (baby sitter) and also the main character's first friend. To the main character, friendships and home is very important to him. If there's no friendships and home, there will be no love. These taught the main character how to love and how to care about someone. else. The main character said friendship and home is the basis in his life, he understand without letting his parents teach him. When you have friendship, home, and love, everything will be perfect for you. All you need is a support from your family. You will be always happy and feel very lucky that you have all of these things.	2	3		3

3912	5	"The @CAPS1 is trying to make the reader understand Narciso Rodriguez feelings by describing how little Narciso had grown up with and how hard it must have been for him to live in that type of enviroment and home. for example ""In 1961 i was born into this simple house, situated two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This quote @CAPS4 how even from his early days being as a child Narciso was still living in poor enviroments and did not have much at all.

3913	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez is a nonstalgic mood is created from his memories. The mood is created by his parents and where he lives. One way the mood is nonstalgic is he's grateful towards his parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than I could have ever done"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). By being grateful towards his parents, he is helping the nonstalgic mood grow. Also, where he live helps the mood. ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home those"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Since his parents turned his house, to a home he will never forget what they did for him, making this memoir more nonstalgic. In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a nonstalgic mood from the memories of his past."	3	3		3																					
3914	5	There are few moods created. They are comfort, Love and sacrifice. Comfort because of the way @PERSON1 described his home, parents, and neigborhood families. Love because his parents loved him and each other very much, and they cared about what they did and their family. Sacrifice because his parents sacrificed their comforting home to move to @LOCATION1 for their son. That was difficult for them, but @ORGANIZATION1 appreciated that. He loves his parents what they did for him.	2	2		2																					
3915	5	There Were many moods set by the @CAPS1 in the memoir. one of the moods was happiness. Narciso had a very happy family. They had many friends and Were thankful.

Which means they were kind and selfless.And he says that ""the warmth of the kitchen of his humble house where a cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love."	3	1		2																					
3919	5	In this memoir, the mood is very pleasant and makes you think of childhood memories. The reason is because he talks about how his parents guided him to be a strong-willed man, and he couldn't have done it unless he had the conditions he did then. He seems to think that if he didnt have the parents and oppurtunities he did then, his life would have been much different.

3926	5	"This memoir definatley has a strong and apperent mood, and that mood stands out to me as Narciso being grateful, he is obiously very thankfull to his parents and family. I know this because the memoir says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" This quote really shows that @PERSON1 is thankfull for his parent's love for him.This mood comes out in the memoir when @PERSON2 says ""But, in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important Family and @CAPS1 are."" This quote shows how he is thankfull for his Family, but also how his Family shaped him as a person.In all, There are many emotions in this story, but the one that @CAPS2 out to me the most was him being gratefull."	3	3		3																					
3927	5	The author created a mood of immense gratefulness. The author knows that not every family (Cuban or possibly @CAPS1) can all get together and be truly happy and grateful for what they have. Not every family can work well with everyone else. Not every family can have the satisfaction of sharing and giving to others. This is a feeling of gratefulness because of the parents. The authors consistantly praises them on their courageous acts, and even going against the law to help those in need. The parens brought such happiness by welcoming those who are different and sharing happiness with them. The author had an incredible experience and is eternally grateful for having such wonderful parents that she had.	2	2		2

Meaning that had to find all new jobs.The author explained her greatfulness by telling her parents that what they did was much more courageous than she could ever do. The author also said that there was no way to express her gratitude for the generosity impressed upon her at such an early age.	2	2		2																					
3930	5	The author gave a loving mood in the memoir. I know this becacus he did not talk badily about anything and he talked about how his parents helped him and other people as a kit. in paragraph two he was talking about how his house was nice and comsortabur. I know this because he sais. the love of cooking and the passioniate Cuban music.	1	1		1																					
3931	5	"A) The mood that was created in this memoir was a basic mood. It wasn't a happy or sad in was a flat mood, because Its talking about how their in debt needed to move the kid lost all of his friends. The kid can't attend school because they can't afford any type of education. so that is why its a basic or flat mood. I also belive its a basic mood because it says that ""kids have to do a lot of the work"" because They are the youngest and the older can't do that work or they will get hurt. Towards the end It gets to a happy mood because it say ""my parents will always be there for me."""	2	1		1

He thanks his parents for giving him a good life and he is grateful for their love and sacrafice. He also describes happiness in the kitchen, the heart of the house.	1	2		2																					
3933	5	"In the memoir @PERSON1 written by @PERSON1 the mood is happiness. First, Rodriguez writes, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)"" (paragraph @NUM1) Narciso's parents have a great skill and love for cooking, now Narciso has a great love and skill for cooking as well. Both of which he is still happy to have today. Finally, @PERSON1 writes, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love.

3934	5	"@PERSON1 wrote this memoir in a happy, warm, senseful way. He was able to describe in great detail what went on in his house during his childhood and how caring and loving his parents were. Not just to him but to almost anybody. Anyone that was considered family was allowed in and he was also grateful to be Cuban and for the foods he was able to eat and the beautiful aromas in his Cuban kitchen. His description of this home is very soothing to me because it just has a happy background and his talk so highly of. It is a tempting place to attend life in this ""make the best of"" little Cuban home."	2	2		2																					
3935	5	I think the mood to author created was proud and happy. Because he got to come to the United States. And live a better life as a immigrant. And he got to get a better education and he is proud and thankful to have parents like that.	1	1		1

3937	5	The life @PERSON1 lived as a child was a paradise in his eyes. He learned what a family really was, people who cares for eachother no matter what. And in his eyes, his whole community was one big family. His parents were kind, giving and generous to everyone. Despite the different customs elsewhere, all of these cultures were united as one family. They would lend a hand for anyone who needed it, because they know that they'd do the same for them. Throughout his life, he'd never forget his wonderful childhood and all the things he was taught, @CAPS1 and Generosity.	2	2		2																					
3938	5	"In this memoir,"" @PERSON1, he is feeling loving when he wrote this. One @CAPS1 is when he says, ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give there children a better life..."" is showing an @CAPS1 of love. Also, when he says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. Last @CAPS1 is when he said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.

These are the authors mood in the memoir."	2	2		2																					
3940	5	"I the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood created by the author is about a cuban that came to american without knowing the language and having no money they made it. It wasn't easy though and for that, that is why Narciso is so grateful. She also tells about how alot of people have came and gone because her parents have open arms to anyone."	1	1		1																					
3941	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy mood because the memoir is about how one parents sacraficid all they have for their child and then they chanced a house into a life time of good memories.	1	1		1																					
3942	5	The author is telling us a story about a kid that Just came to the United States. He is only @NUM1 years old & he likes it. A man named narciso @PERSON1 is a memoir to all the people.	0	0		0																					
3943	5	In this memoir author makes the mood happy. One example is when they talk about all being a family and letting people stay. Another is when they are talking about the racism and other things but says how the neighbors have united. All in all the mood for the memoir was happy.	1	2		2																					
3944	5	"In today's aspects, @PERSON1 wouldn't be considered wealthy, but underneath material, he is more wealthy than most people will ever be. For example, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a relative."" Family is very valuable, and a great wealth to Narciso, and throughout the memoir he keeps bringing the feelings of family. It's seem like that emotion was give that held everything together and would make it all ok! He also experiences great gratitude towards his parents and his neighbors; ""But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit and generosity impressed on me at a such an early age and be demonstration or how important family and friends are."" I think the overall mood of this memoir is very warm, and optemistic about life. They make the best of their situation, and that really made an impression on Narciso. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" "	3	3		3																					
3945	5	"The mood created by the author is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and relaxing. I think that because all he's talking about is his family and how much his parents did for him. For example in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I will never forget how my Parents turned this simple house into a home."" To me that sounds like @CAPS2 because he knows he can always come home to his Parents if he ever need help. Another example is in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I learned there about how to love"". That to me sounds like when he was growing up it was rough and he never actually loved some one in his life until now."	1	3		2																					
3946	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives is immense gratitude, happiness, and admiration.

3947	5	"In the memoir from ""Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives"" the creates a good mood of accomplishment.

The second appearance of this mood is when the author writes of how their community came together and helped eachother through the segregation and racism of the time period.

""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful) (paragraph @NUM1). This quote shows Narciso's appreciation for the culinary skills his parents passed down to him. The extra information in the parentheses also provide a grateful tone to the piece of writing. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The language used (grateful) shows the intence thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word ""grateful"" is used repeadtly. The use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important. So grateful appears to be a keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age"" There is so much passion in this phrase. ""There is no way to express my gratitude"" shows that he's just so thankful there is not way to even express it.

Narciso is grateful in a way @CAPS1 could never be able to show them his gratitude. ""... I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity...""

This is not unexpected considering it is a memoir however there were few statement facts and everything was personal experience.

The author constantly describes how his family's generosity made his apartment into a friendly place with the constant coming and going of relatives, distant and close. Next the author installed a sense of warmth. The very idea of this family moving from cuba into this three room apartment for their son really gives any reader some sense of warmth. Finally the author gives us a Sense of culture. As early as paragraph @NUM1 the author writes...""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.

I believe the mood is one of gratitude, gratitude of how his parents struggled to raise him right and well. He is grateful for his home, his family, and his community, of course he ""groups"" the last two together because of the deep, emotional way they all felt. Gratitude is one thing so he doesn't have."	2	2		2

The mood made it really easy to understand and read.The mood of this story is not funky or funny. The mood is like haveing a regular conversation with a person.

For example in paragraph @NUM1, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)."" Its more of a fun fact or personal note.In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez,"" has a very formal mood, with a personal twist.

No one leaves a family member out. In his neighborhood there mostly lived, Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants. All these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. Narciso's parents came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.

4052	5	The author set the mood in different ways Such as describing where he lived before he moved then when he told about his culture and him inheriting it then how he moved to @LOCATION1. He does not set the mood when he talks about his parents being selfish. The biggest part of the mood is talking about where he lived at first, where and what he had. He might have a good start with mood if he told more about the kind of education he got whether he was in Cuba or @LOCATION1.

4092	5	"The mood in the memoir is happyness, and friendship, and glory, an example is ""My parents always always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. A feeling of friendship and honesty is ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, where clearly in need."" and that is the mood of the memoir."	1	2		2																					
4093	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the memoir gives a loving and thankful tone. The loving and thankful tone is snowing the definition of ""family"". In paragraph seven the author states, ""and for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows that the tone is thankful for what the parents had done and love them at the same time. As I aformentioned, the tone is love and thanked."	2	2		2																					
4094	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, there is a clear mood created by the author. For instance the Cuban background set the mood of happiness.

Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows her love and happiness from her Cuban background. Also another mood set by the author is greatfulness. Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

Also all of the hard work they do and what they gave up back in Cuban in order to come to @LOCATION1. His dad worked in the laboratory and his mom studied chemichal engineering. Lastly he is grateful to have grown up in a really good home.          Another mood is happiness. In the first paragraph parenthesis mean that he really enjoys cooking and Cuban music. He is also very proud about his Cuban @CAPS1 and how his extended family stays with him.            This memoir has a lot of mood in it and it makes it a lot better.	2	3		3

When he is in the @CAPS2.S he finds a house and later in the @CAPS1 he and his famliy makes the house into a home. The @CAPS1 is also about in explaning how is life is like what he dose like cooking for his famliy and what he dose in his free time.	1	1		1																					
4116	5	@PERSON1 is a memoir of family memories growing up in an immigrant neighborhood. Throughout the reading Narciso created a very grateful and excited mood. One example of this was when he said that he was forever grateful of his families Cuban cooking.Another example of this mood was when he was getting excited over the fact that his whole immigrants neighborhood was lending out a helping hand even if you had a different @NUM1  also portrayed greatfulness by how that even though he hasn't met his real grandparents, that someone in the neighborhood supplanted them and treated @PERSON1 like a grand-child. That is the mood that @PERSON1 showed in his memoir of his family.	2	2		2																					
4117	5	"I think the mood of the memoir is overall positive. The charactor is always complimenting his parents and is always telling him he admires ""their strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 of the memoir is the child complimenting the parents and culitur. Narciso strongly adores him family."	1	1		1																					
4118	5	In the quick story @PERSON1 the auther shows a mood of gratitude and appreciation for what her parents have done throughout their lives. They have gone through tough moments but they kept moving on to make their lifes and their child's life easy and good	1	1		1																					
4119	5	The author's mood is happiness the author is really happy to do this @CAPS1 about this family that is grateful of liveing in their country that they love with all their hearts and they will never forget their country.	2	1		2																					
4120	5	"The mood Created by the author in the memoir is in my opinion pure happiness and Love. Narciso Rodriguez says that ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sence that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. This family shows this many times in this memoir, they always had people over, like the landloard's daughter Alegria who was Narciso's first friend and babysitter she went over to eat dinner very often. Narciso also States that ""also at the table were sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would know my ""real"" grandparents, Narciso the Elder and @PERSON2, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba)"" @CAPS1 also always has many of his aunts, uncles, and cousins for dinner, and ""countless extended family members came and went"" But @CAPS1 says @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their door open to the many people we considered family"" which explains why the house was full of happiness but I think the house was full of love because ""I will never forget how my parents turned a simple house into a home."""	3	3		3																					
4121	5	I think the authors mood is, honored, proud, loving, and appreciated. I think the author mood is part of being honored because (in paragraph @NUM1) he really expressed how he feels about his parents being so loving and makes others feel loved and welcomed. I also think he was proud because, he explains (in paragraph @NUM2) how much he appreciates his family and his parents to have open arms and help thoughs in need, and to have such great parents that he does'nt even have words really to express to commitment and kindness his parents have with everyone. Through out the story the author alway's mentions How loving his partent are and you can see in the passage that he picked that trait up with the words and expression he used in the story to express the fact of his parents being loving to their family and their @CAPS1. Those are what I think are his moods and the reason for them.	2	2		2																					
4122	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice, and calm. It describs How the famialy let people in their house with open arms and a open door and  that makes me and mybe other people seem the mood is nice. The mood is calm because  it talks about this famialy doing nice thing and there is no yelling no fighting and I find the to be nice, and calm.	1	1		1																					
4123	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is that every time he talks about his new home his mood changes. For example paragraph @NUM1 rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day). Every time there is parentheses means that the mood of the story changes when he talks about his life in cuba and the new life here in america. He is grateful that he is in america and that his parents left cuba where they had a better life.	2	2		2																					
4124	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez has a loving and caring feel to it. Since he is talking about his family of course he is going to @CAPS1 loving. For example he says ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends"". This shows that he misses those times and he missed them he definetely cared about those times. So the mood created in the excerpt is loving and caring."	1	2		2																					
4125	5	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is very understandable and true. Throughout the memoir the author says how grateful he is for his parents. In the memoir Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents had to go through a lot of hard things. They had to leave their country, their friends and family, and they had to pretty much start their lives over again. But his parents stood strong in those hard times. They cared and taught Narciso many important things. The mood the author sets is very loving. The author had very incredible parents that he is very grateful for."	2	2		2																					
4126	5	"The mood that the author creates in the memoir is loving and grateful. Narciso tells the reader about how grateful. @CAPS1 is for living in @LOCATION1, and that even though @CAPS1 didn't live in a big, nice house, her family is what makes her love her house. @CAPS1 loves and appreciates what her family did for her. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. @CAPS1 will never forget the house because it is where @CAPS1 learned the real definition of family. ""It is where I learned the real definition of ""family."" And For this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. "	2	2		2																					
4127	5	"In the memoir, the author doesn't just describe the journey to @LOCATION1 and the house he lived in. He gives a in depth and warm description of his life in @LOCATION1 and the relationships he made. He also spends some time talking about the selflessness of his parents and what they do to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this new place.The author sets the mood that makes people wanna read this if they are feeling sad and they just want to get a warm, cozy feeling from it. I think the mood in this gives off a sence of being selfless, but also coming together when all are segregated and form unity. When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen. The authors says this in his memoir: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place.If we do as they do, we can all live in unity."	3	2		2																					
4128	5	In the memoir the boy talks about how his parents gave up every thing for him and how they were self less bye inviting refuges even thouw There was not that motch Room.	1	0		1																					
4129	5	"In this memoir the author created a mood of what it was like in his childhood home. Based on pharagraph @NUM1, cooking was a big part of the author's childhood life. The author describes a home filled with the smell of the kitchen and the ""passionate @CAPS1 music."" @CAPS2 a warm mood that makes you think of home, this pharagraph is the base of the authors childhood. The author lived in a neighborhood of immigrants that were friendly and always helped each other out. In pharagraph @NUM2, the author describes a mood of family, friendship and acceptance. Even though the people of the neighborhood weren't all the same, they except one another as equals during a time of racism and segregation. Coming to a different country and starting a new life can be extremly difficult. It is hard to get good jobs when you just immigrated and maybe don't have a ton of money. It is also hard to get used to climate change, and learning another language. This creates a mood of hardship and rough times. Throughout this memoir the author creates moods, whether good or bad, of the memories of his childhood."	3	2		3																					
4130	5	The mood created in this article is a joyful mood. He says, my parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today and for which I am exernally grateful. This shows that he is grateful for what he received and the mood is very joyful. Also he says Passionate Cuban music which I adored this day filled the air mixing with the aroma of the kitchen, Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. I mean that the mood is lighthened up a  little when he says all of this stuff.	2	2		2																					
4131	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author created a very thankful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly tells us how much he sill loves it today. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2) ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is. Only a person who is very thankful ""will never forget..."" something. Throughout Narciso's memoir, there is a very clear and constant mood of thankfullness."	3	3		3																					
4132	5	The memoir is that @ORGANIZATION2 lived in Cuba they arrive at the @ORGANIZATION3. They finally could afford a @NUM1 bedroom apart-ment where they had a baby in 1961 thats when Narciso Rodriguez. in @LOCATION1. in a blond brick building within its thin walls my young parents created our traditional Cuban home The very heart was my kitchen Both of my parents were cooks. They love to cook. Passionate cuban music filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen.	1	1		1

4134	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness Here are my three reasons why I think that First of all, Narciso is proud of the way @CAPS2 lives and who @CAPS2 is. It all began, starting with his parents, they are immagrants. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house.""@CAPS1 of all, @CAPS2 cherished every moment @CAPS2 lived. @CAPS2 is grateful for all the things his parents did for him and everyone else. ""my parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we consider family"".Finally, His parents migrated from cuba. They are known as immagrents because they was not born in america, and narciso is proud and honestly happy for them. Thats why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness."	2	3		3																					
4135	5	"In the memoir there were actually two main moods. The first mood and most prominant mood was joy and happyness. Because throught the memoir the reader learns about the writers family and how greatfull the writer was for her family. An example of this is when the writer wrote: ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" But joy is not the only mood in the memoir, because though the memoir is mostly about positive things, the reader still has to remember that this is a memoir. Meaning this was only written because Narciso Rodriguez passed away. Therefor sadness is also a mood in this memoir. In the end, the joyfull mood sort of covers the depressing one, but to really get a sense of where the writer is coming from the reader most consider both these moods."	3	1		1																					
4136	5	"There are many moods that the author creates in the story, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of our lives. Some moods it creats are sad, brave, and thankfull.

In paragraph @NUM2, he also says he will always be greatful to his @CAPS1. Leaving your freinds and families behind is a brave action.He also creates a sad mood when he says that all imigrants come selflessly to this country to give their children a better life.

But it is @CAPS3 and @CAPS5 because they his parents had him and they had A house feel like a home to him. they tought him how to cook and they showed him diffrent music from his cultere and he adores the music today that information was in @CAPS4 @NUM1 The last thing that made this @CAPS7 @CAPS3 and @CAPS5 was. the naigboors lived together and where there for each other when they need each other. Plus they had all diffrent religons italian, Spanish, and cubain. I got this statment from @CAPS4 @NUM2 that is why this @CAPS7 is @CAPS3 but also at the same time sad.	3	3		3																					
4139	5	"The mood in this selection is prode and happy. I know this from some clues in the text. the first and biggest clue is when the auther states some facts like ""and for wich I am eternaly ""greatful"" and ""witch I adore to this day. Also when she says that ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" it shows how prouud she is."	2	2		2																					
4140	5	"From the memoir Home: Blueprints of Our Lives by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a mood of gratitude and love. The author's gratitude is to his parents for their cultural and selflessness for leaving their family and friends so their kids could have a better life. one line that really showed this was ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on a love of cooking that is still with me today"" (@NUM1). That line shows how much he loves his culture and heritage. He loves his Cuban family with all their traditions. I'm aware of this because of a line ""Passionate Cuban Music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" (@NUM1). Narciso Rodriguez is constantly creating a mood of gratitude and love in his memoir."	2	2		2																					
4141	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a mood of happiness. Rodriguez explains how appriciative he is of his parents and every thing they have done for him. Making his house a home and always being there for him. He talks about friend ships and familys, but family being the relation ships between their friends even if they werent blood realitives. Overall he thanked his parents and said ""in reality there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age, and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."	2	3		3																					
4142	5	In his memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a reflective and relaxed mood about his memories. For example, his use of parentheses create a voice for him through which the reader can better understand what he is trying to say. Also, by reflecting positiely on old times, it feels as if the author is right here next to the reader, having a pleasant conversation. For example, when he is talking about his landlord's daughter, @LOCATION1, he mentions how she would often grace his table with her presence.Furthermore, by describing the enviroment of his apartment, it feels to the reader most as if we are sitting in a wood backed chair listening to the sweet saranade of an unamed Cuban singer. The smell of spices lingers in the air, The smoke from a stove waters the eye's as it drifts lazily out the window. The sound of engines and the beep of horns created by the low roar of a bus plays in the backround. The bright reds, oranges, and yellows of the furniture burn pleasantly in the eyes. This reflective and relaxed mood is so important for the author to get his stories across, and Narciso Rodriguez does it well.	1	1		1																					
4143	5	The mood that author has created in this memoir was a happy feeling because this is proud of his culture. He loves his parents and loves that house that they turned into a home. The author exsplains how his life begain in new jersey and how proud of his parents he was and that he looks up to them and plans on carryinging out the culture and triditions that his family had so that's what makes me think that the mood of that the author sets was happiness and fullness of this familys life, and as I read this passage I was glad and happy for him that he admires his family that much and how happy his life was.	2	3		3																					
4144	5	"The mood created in the memoir could be of happiness, gratefulness and love.

4146	5	I think that the mood of this excerpt is caring. The parents wouldn't have (pretty much) given their lives away to start new and give their children a better place to live. They had a perfectly good life back at home but gave it all away for their children. That is why the mood of this excerpt is caring.	1	1		1

4150	5	"Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.""

4151	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love.

They allowed people who weren't even apart of their family to become part of their family, they loved and cared for other, possiably even more than them selves and gave up everything they had in cuba to come to america for a better future for their children. The amount of love in this house is what turned it form an ordiary house and into a loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home, not only for Narciso but for everyone in the community, and family"" that was created. That is what the mood of this memoir was, and in whom created it."	2	3		3																					
4152	5	The mood was happy beacuse most of his family immigrated to @LOCATION1. That him and his parents loved to cook. He loved the smell of the kitchen There family sometimes cooks and to visit them and eat. The auther past was unhappy because they needed to put up with racism.	1	1		1

4155	5	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author in the memoir was happy, but sometimes sad. The author made sure that the mood went along with the words in the story. The words were happy and sometimes sad. The mood in the beginning of story was sad, but then it got happier as the story went on. This was the mood created by the author in the memoir."	1	1		1																					
4156	5	"The mood the author created in the memoir was about family. He describes how it was when he was growing up in New Jersey. He talk's about ""Sergio and Edelmira"" who were his grandparents ""his real grandparents he did not see until 1970. Even though alot of the people around him were not his real family he consider them to be because they cared and love him. That's what I think the mood in the memoir is."	1	1		1																					
4157	5	"The mood created by the memoir created by the author @PERSON1 is that he is a clothing designer that is internationally recognized by the world and he offered his definition of ""family"".

4159	5	"The, mood created by Narciso Rodriguez is very @CAPS1 and happy. In paragraph @NUM1 nothing really happens so there is no real feeling. About half way through the @NUM2 paragraph was when the memoir started to get very @CAPS1. It is really @CAPS1 because you realize that he can turn a New Jersey apartment into a traditional Cuban home. It says in paragraph @NUM3 that they are neighborhood was made up of, ""Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and there was segregation."" It is really @CAPS2 that those cultures could be in a friendly neighborhood during those times. In paragraphs @NUM4 and @DATE1 when Narciso Rodriguez starts to thank his parents it feels as if you were inside that house and your having dinner with their family. Overall, the memoir about turning a New Jersey three-room apartment into a traditional Cuban home was a very @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 story throughout the entire memoir."	2	3		3																					
4160	5	The mood of the author of the story is happy and sad. Happy because he is so grateful to have had parents like he did/does and sad because all of his childhood wasn't great but having a family made it happy and it made it seem more like a home and where his family should be	1	1		1																					
4161	5	"When I read ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I thought the mood was warm and thoughtful. ""family had nothing to do with being blood related"" I thought that was welcoming and  showed that his parents didn't care who you were or what culture you believed in. He would always thank his parents, because they had left cuba so that their children could have a better life. His parents thought that if they get through the bad time they will enjoy the good times to come and for that he always thanked them."	3	3		3																					
4162	5	The mood created by the author is a happy and grateful one. The memoir expresses a positive mood and their are no signs, at all, of negativity throughout the memoir. The author created a mood that tells the reader that he does not regret anything from his childhood and he's grateful for his wonderful and caring parents. The author created a mood that also tells the reader that he is proud of his Cuban heritage and everything and everyone that he has grown up around. Narciso has also made a mood of strong feelings toward his beloved parents, friends, and family. The mood of this memoir is positive and can be described in great meaning.	2	1		2																					
4163	5	"The authors mood in the story ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, could be discribed as calm, and a little sad. The author is constantly talking about, and remembering, what her home was like when she was growing up. But, now she is moving away from her beloved home and it makes her sad. Also, she talks about how ""My parents always Kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This would also make her seem sad because maybe her parents died and that's what she remembers about them. As you can see, the authors tone in this memoir is calm, and sad."	2	1		2																					
4164	5	"In the memoir written by @PERSON1 the author created a mood, that shines throughout the story. The mood represents the hapiness in @LOCATION3's life when he lived in a three room apartment Newark, New Jersey. In paragraph two, the author talks about how his parents used their heritage of Cuba and brought it to their new home in the United States. @PERSON1 was always greatful how his whole house was revolved around the kitchen. There was always Cuban music and the smell of a Cuban fiest in the air. @PERSON1 was always happy because he was always a part of a family. Through out the tough times @PERSON1's parents went through there was never a shortage of love or the feeling of family. In paragraph six, the author says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" When the author says this, it creates a happy mood, and it flows through out the memoir. Also in paragraph seven he says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This memoir shows that the importance of family and friends creates a positive feeling in anyone's life."	3	3		3																					
4165	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love for family. He writes about how his parents and other immigrants moved to @CAPS1.S.A only for a better life of their children. He writes that in a way which could make the reader feel that he is extremely happy. He also talks about how his parents taught him to cook and talked to him about Cuban culture. He was extremely proud and grateful to his parents to teach him all these. The author writes about how this small simple home was very special home to him and also how much it meant to him. Also this house has been this special to him, by spending his childhood there and also how he got love from his parents in this house. This was the house where he was able to learn what the word ""family"" really meant and also how it made him happy about how he would never in his life be able to forget his family. These love and happiness were the the moods created by the author in the memoir dedicated to his family."	3	3		3																					
4166	5	"Inthe memoir the author the mood the author sets is a thankful soft one The author is thanking his parents in a good way, in a nice, soft, and appreciative way. ""It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house with a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always fills the air with not just scent and music but life and love (pg. @NUM1). All you need in life is a little imagination and a lot a help and love. This guy in the memoir got a lot of help in love by describing it in a nice calm way, of thanking his parents for all they have done for him."	2	1		2																					
4167	5	"The mood that is created by the author is joy. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parent's are immigrants who works hard. They could've stayed in their own country but they wanted a better future for Narciso. When Narciso realized that he felt happy and filled with joy. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents."" When you're grateful you feel happyness. This is the mood that I think this author created."	2	2		2																					
4168	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, and happiness. In the memoir the reader expresses the love and gratitude towards his parents. Not only did his parents love him; they quit their jobs and moved across the world just so they could give their son a better life. The authors parents risked so much for their son. The author states that he is very grateful for his parents, and that there is no way to express the love he feels for his parents. This memoir expresses the love, and gratitude in one's family, and how a little bit of caring can go a long way.	2	2		2																					
4169	5	The mood of this story is very weird. This story is about different cultures coming together as one. Narciso's parents are very nice and generous. His parents are always taking in @CAPS1 needs a home, and treats them like family. Narciso still has some family in Cuba, and will might be able to meet them until a later time in life. Anyways the mood of this story is very heart-warming, Narciso was also thankful for everything he has, Narciso's parents have a lot of people to feed since, There is more than one family living in their home so It is hard for them. Well I think the mood of the story is great.	2	2		2																					
4170	5	"The overall mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. First, Narciso's parents went through the struggle of coming to @LOCATION2 and starting over. Narciso narrates, ""My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."" His parents came from Cuba to the United States to have a happier future. Narcisos family is nice to everyone and everyone in their neighborhood is nice to them. He explains his parents doings.

4171	5	in This @CAPS1, narciso Rodriguez, The @CAPS2 in the @CAPS1 would be a @CAPS5 bit sad, sad because @CAPS3 is taking about her life and how @CAPS3 grows up in a one @CAPS5 Simple house in 1961. her mother didns want her to live anywhere else. @CAPS3 was a only child. and this @CAPS1 tells you mostly about her life. That is the @CAPS2 in the @CAPS1 @PERSON2.	1	0		1																					
4172	5	I think the mood given by the author in the memoir is a happy mood. I think this because throughout the entire memoir the author didn't talk about one unhappy thing. In paragraph @NUM1 the author talks about how his parents taught him how to cook and how they gave him a love for passionate Cuban music. In paragraph @NUM2 the author talks about the unity and friendship throughout his neighborhood despite the racial differences. The author talks about all his friends and family who graced his table in paragraph @NUM3. The most important thing I think he talked about was how he learned to love in paragraph @NUM4.      As you can see there are no sad memories in this memoir and I think that is what gives it such a happy mood.	3	3		3																					
4173	5	"The mood created in the memoir was very greatful because of @PERSON1's family that nearly gave everything up to have a wonderful life in New Jersey. He was grateful for the talents his parents passed on such as cooking and loved the heritage they had like their interest in Cuban Music. @PERSON1 must've been very grateful to be surrounded by so many loving people like his ""@CAPS1 lord and his daughter, @PERSON2 (my baby sitter and first friend)...(who) graced our Kitchen table for meals more often than not"""	2	2		2

That shows How much @CAPS2 cares about her mother and father and How respectful @CAPS2 is towards them. Anothe example that her mother and father is @CAPS3 and cares a lot is when her mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. That line proves how much the mom and dad care about there daughter."	2	1		2																					
4175	5	The mood created by the author was very interesting. At some points the author was very serious. He would tell about the hard times his family had and what they went through. Then he would be joy ful. He would explain what his house would be like. He would tell how joy ful his house was and how he loves his parents so much. He would explain what loving parents he had. He showed how his family wasn't blood related at all. His family was different cultures all combined to make one happy family.	1	2		1																					
4176	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is gratitude and happiness. Narciso repeatedly states how grateful he is to his parents for showing him what it really means to be a family and having selflessness and caring. He says, ""In reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" When he is recollecting memories from his childhood he shows how there was a lot of happiness in their home. He says, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" With his memoir, Narciso creates a great mood filled with gratitude, happiness, and a sense of childhood."	3	2		3																					
4177	5	"The mood in the memoir of the life of Narciso Rodriguez is mostly how the bonds between him and his parents, and everyone around them got them through tough times. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 he states that in their neighborhood ""cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship"" And how ""immigrants extended helping hands to people, who were not only their own kind, but who needed a helping hand."" The author says that in his community many different cultures came together and help each other through racism, and other tough times. He says that ""family"" isn't just those you are related to blood, but those who are close to your heart."	2	2		2																					
4178	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness. Narciso is remembering all the great times he had in his house. His parents are very friendly and welcoming and treat everyone like family. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without knowledge of the language or the culture."" This is what happiness really is. Narciso and his whole family have such a great attitude and just want to be friends with everyone. "	2	2		2																					
4179	5	The mood of the story is different throughout the memoir. During the the parts were he talks about the struggles to get from Cuba to @LOCATION1 the mood is sad depessing. But the mood is different when he talks about how his family sometime gets to gether for dinner when they throw a Cuban party for the relitives who arrived to @LOCATION1 from Cuba.	1	1		1																					
4180	5	"In the memoir ""@PERSON1 from Home: The blueprints of our lives."" I belive the author Narciso Rodriguez, demostraigted the mood of being laidback very acticulatly.This memoir dose not soud very formal due to the fact Narciso does little things like adding parenthenthese with aditoal statments for exsample in paragraph @NUM1. And taking about his friends and family so openly.Thats why I @PERSON1's memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blue prints of our lives."" @CAPS1 the mood of being laid back."	0	1		1																					
4181	5	There are many times in the memoir when author created a mood. One time that the author created a mood was when he described a traditional cuban home. In which the kitchen is the heart of the home. Also when the cuban music mixes with the aromas of the kitchen. This gives off the mood of hunger for great food. Another time when the author created a mood was when he described how he lived in a close-knit community. This shows how the author grew up helping people. While being helped in return. This gives the mood of wanting to help someone in need. A third time the author created a mood was when he described his parents as caring people. His family always helped people who were considered family to them. This creates the mood of hope because his family knew that other people would do the same for them. Clearly, there are many times when the authour creates a mood for the reader.	3	2		3																					
4182	5	"In this memoir, the mood created by the author was heartwarming and apperciative. There were so many parts to this story that made me feel so warm and made me want to say ""aw"". For example, in paragraph @NUM1 where it states, ""was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people, not nessecarly of their own kind, were clearly in need"". This line showed me how much love there must've been. Also, that everyone cared about everyone else. When the author is showing how her parents left their country to come to @LOCATION1, you can tell how grateful the author is this is shown extremely clear in paragraph @NUM2 where it states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.I think this story made me realize that you need to apperciate what others do for you. This author was so greatful for her parents, and that is shown very clearly in this memoir."	3	3		3

This past @DATE1 I was in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3 and I had to stay with this family. This family was great to me, and I will never forget their uncany attitudes to give me whatever I want.

The author is joyfull because in stanza two Narciso states ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that the childhood of this person was joyful with the culture, family, friends, foods, and smells. This person is very grateful for all of the things he parents did. Such as when the author states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could've ever done. I thank them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for this period of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.""

4193	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very humble, caring, and grateful mood in his memoir.The humility shows when he describes how, although rich and inviting on the inside, his house was simple and ""modest"" on the outside. All of the home's warmth and comfort was crammed into a three-room apartment.The sense of caring was demonstrated throughout the whole memoir in the way that Rodriguez referred to not just his blood-relatives, but the friends and neighbors whom he considered ""family."" Of his parents, he says that they ""always kept their arms and their door open"" to their community.Rodriguez expresses his gratitude again and again, especially in the sixth paragraph.

When the author spoke of his family and friends that came to dine in the apartment that was made into a home, Narciso created a very relaxed mood.

4240	5	"The mood is a mixture of things, it's really hard to say withe all the emotions the author throws around. But however the strongest feeling is unity, and family.I'm Not sure family can be called an emotion, but it is I think something that can be described by several. One of course is unity, or as he says it, ""great solidarity and friendship""it's rather sweet how he charectorizes family as something as the bonds you make withe people in contrast to other cultures where family is from blood ties and family s always first. So in a way I think his way of thinking comes from his culture.But also he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. As they say ""happiness is nothing without appreciating it"" and as he says ""I learned the real defnetion of family"" so apparently he knows real happiness"	3	2		3

This emphasizes the mood, and he repeats it many times and the repetition helps build mood as well. A final thing that helps the mood is how he describes how everyone in his nieghborhood was kind to each other. In conclusion, there are many things in this work that emphasize a relaxed, caring mood.	2	2		2																					
4243	5	Within the walls of narciso, her young parents created there traditional @CAPS1 home, There heart was the kitchen. Narciso parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on there rich culinar skills to narciso she love to cook. Quite the countrary narciso neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish Italian immigrants at a time racism. her parents came selflessly, as some immigrants will do, to give their children a better life. They sacafised leaving their family friends and careers, in the county they came from I think her memory is a nice, happy one becuase with those memorys she knows what her family went through.	2	2		2																					
4244	5	"The mood created by the author was love from his family The author describes ""a love of (cuban) cooking which is still with me (the author) today"" and how ""Passionate cuban music which I (the author) still adore today."" The author got this love from his parents. Another way the author created the mood of love was by talking about how his ""parents always kept there arms and door open."" I know that it takes a lot to be able to let anyone into your home. The authors speaking very lovingly at this point in the story. The author also says that he ""will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice."" This also sets the mood of the story because they are talking about a loving relationship The mood that the author set during the story was love. I think that this was a really good mood to set in a story."	2	3		3																					
4245	5	"I think the mood created by the author was gratefulness towards his parents. Narciso Rodriguez wants to tell his parents how very special they are to him and how much he thanks them for what they did for him. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez says that ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" I think that in this memoir, Narciso wants the reader to understand how he feels about his family. He wants to tell us about what they did for him. Narciso thanks his parents for their sacrifice and I think by telling us his story, the mood that was created was gratefulness towards the parents who made him a 'home.'"	2	2		2																					
4246	5	"The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 is different and uneek to other I have heard. I belive that the @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 is trying to make is happyness, and selflessness, and grateful. I think this because he describes his parents As selflessness and takes everyone in to theire small Apartment. I also think he is creating ""warth"" by saying that his first birthday with his parent Are comfortting That is the @CAPS1 I belive the @CAPS3 is trying to create. "	2	1		2																					
4247	5	c.The mood in this passage Narciso Rodriguez's home, nationality, and his family. He often talks about his nationality. He is proud to be born in Cuba and not afraid to say it. He is also married. He lives in the @DATE1's. In america. He also often talks about his @NUM1 bedroom apartment in Newark, New Jersey. He aslo likes to talk about the new freinds he mad here. And his family. Also Narciso childhood. His neighborhood is made out of cubans, And @CAPS1. That was the memoir of this passage. 	2	0		1																					
4248	5	"The mood in the memoir is grateful. It is grateful in a few ways. One way is in paragraph six he says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because they moved to the @CAPS1 from Cuba. Another way is in paragraph @NUM1 he says ""my parents both shared cooking duties an unwittingly passed on to me they're rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I admired to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows that he is grateful toward his parents because of their Cuban culture and specifically their cooking skills being passed on to him. Those are some reasons why the mood of the memoir is grateful."	3	3		3																					
4249	5	The mood  Created by the author in the memoir is a happy One because in the memoir Narciso was happy with with all her parents did for her and the neighborhood was a peace one, every body reached out to help who ever needed help.	2	2		2																					
4250	5	The memoir looks back on his childhood, with fondness, so I'd call the mood whistful. Yes, the author creates a whistful mood, by talking about his childhood home, friends and family. But... whistfulness only lasts until the end of paragraph @NUM1... after that it becomes a greatful mood, where he's giving out thanks and describing what his parents went through. If it is possible to have two moods, then this memoir does. The moods are both whistful and greatful. Yes.	2	2		2																					
4251	5	The mood of the author and the memoir is greatful. The author is very greatful for his parents. He is thankful for his parents because they gave up their life for him. They moved from their country so that he could grow up in @LOCATION1. His parents quit their jobs and came over all for him. He is also greatful for his extended family and friends. They are the ones who he eats with, plays with and etc. He takes care of them and they take care of him. They are his surrogate grandparents, aunts, uncles cousins and friends. He is also thank full for his culture. All his food along with traditions come from cuba. The author is greatful.	2	2		2																					
4252	5	the mood that the author created in the memoir was so sad and happy and they wer were interested are. I think that this memoir is a good one and I liked the tital of it Narciso Rodriguez.	1	0		1																					
4253	5	"The mood created by the author is both @CAPS1 and love. At first the mood the author created was @CAPS1. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""They struggled both personally and financially."" Narciso explains the tragedies his parents had to face in order for him to live in @LOCATION1. So by reading the excerpt based on the poverty and struggles his family faced makes you grow @CAPS1 for them. I also chose love. In the excerpt it states. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" @CAPS3 the excerpt the author explains the love he learned to form for the ""family"" @CAPS3 the neighborhood. Therefore that's why I think love is another mood created by the author. These are the reasons I chose both @CAPS1 and love for the moods created by the author based on the excerpt. "	3	3		3																					
4254	5	In this memoir the mood was created Narciso and his family. @PERSON2 family, created the mood by bring all of the family together in thier old home in Cuba and thier new home in @LOCATION1. @PERSON2 brought the mood is this memoir by loveing his family and telling them every day that he is thankful of everything that they did for him whan he was just a child to when he is grown up. Also @PERSON2 family took people in whan thay had nowhere to go and they stayed with them until they got back on thier feet.	1	2		2																					
4255	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir can be describe in many ways. The mood that the author created was confusing. Is confusing because I see more than one too many times. Some of the are happyness, proudness, sadness, and other ones. It's because the memoir talks about Narciso Rodriguez life. The mood created by the author can't be describe since there's too many.	1	0		1																					
4256	5	The author creates a @CAPS1 but happy mood and shows @CAPS1 parts and happy parts in the @CAPS2 about a boy whos parents immigrated. his house was what he grew up in and his parents put a Cuban twist to it.	1	1		1																					
4257	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness because in mostly all of the paragraphs he talks about how much he loves his parents and his cuban culture. Narciso talks about how his parents made his everyday house into a home. That is why I think Narciso is happy in this memior. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Within the walls, my young parents created our traditional cuban home, the very heart of which was my kitchen."""	2	2		2																					
4258	5	"The author is very happy and satisfied with the family he has and want his family has done. The author appriciate what his parents has done to other of his parents that immigrated from Cuba. He dedicates what he has learned such as cooking, manners, and friendship to his parents. The author ""admires the strenght and preseverance and have thanked them repeatedly."" overall the author could not had a better family then this, they showed them how to live and that is what a families should accomplish."	2	2		2																					
4259	5	Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The blueprints of our Lives shared his feelings, traditions, and Love he shared with his family growing up.Narciso and his @CAPS1 and dad were cuban. they shared their cuban traditions with eachother and were warm and welcoming with eachother and other people. Narciso's family was generous to other people and shared with everyone. they were all kind to eachother and lived a traditional @CAPS2.Narciso emphasized a mood during the memoir .. The love and meaning of family.	2	2		2																					
4260	5	In this memoir it talks about what the true meaning of selflessness and a home really is. At the beginning of this memoir they talk about how their parents knew the struggles of a life. And would invite people into their home until they got back on their feet. It was at least five years until the parents could afford a decent sized house.Even though his parents left Cuba they still made an effort to keep all their Cuban traditions alive. His parents loved to cook and taught Narciso how to. They also play traditional Cuban music. Also, they taught him to be selfless. They would invite people over even if they weren't the same race because it didn't matter to them.	2	2		2																					
4261	5	"The mood created in this memoir is love and unity. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) ""... all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This means that they were close, loving, and unified. This memoir gave me the feeling that just a house is not a home until there is love. ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"". This also gives me the feeling of warmth and love."	2	2		2																					
4262	5	"In my opinion the mood is created by the auther in the memoir by the setting and describing her child hood, where she was born and why her parents came here. The reason I think this is because the mood can create this setting, because the mood is the feeling in the story, such as sad, happy, lonely, silent and that is what creates the setting which is where, when, and time of the story. Some examples from the excerpt are, ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family building, in the Ironbound Section of Newark, New Jersey."" Also, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" The author is very thankful for her cuban heritage and her home is about relationship then just space. In this memoir the mood created the setting."	3	2		3																					
4263	5	The mood is a family that tried to move from their home country to start a new life in a new country	1	0		1																					
4264	5	"The mood the author created in this memoir was very proud. I could tell that the mood was like that because he would always talk about his parents and how they gave up so much to come here. For example in paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""My mother and father came to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language Or culture... To give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their family, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" I could @CAPS1 feel the prid in that because he is talking about how his parents left every thing basicly for him. Also, he mentions how his parents opened their arms to who ever needed help even though they were the richest people either. He gave many examples throughout the memoir that strongly showed the mood he made in this memoir, pride"	3	2		3																					
4265	5	The @CAPS1 creates a mood of happiness in the @CAPS2. He states memories of his child that made him happy. He mentions the love that he had of cooking with his parents. He also mentions music as being passionate and that he still adores it even to this day. He also describes how good his neighborhood was and how they were a close knit community. Then he startes to explain that a lot of his family was not just blood related but how it included other people. He then explained that he's parents were very self sacrafising people. So it was a very good mood the @CAPS1 wrote the @CAPS2 in.	3	2		3																					
4266	5	"The mood the @CAPS1 creates is happy. He had no negative comment about his parents or the way he grew up. His parents sacrificed everything for him so he can have a better life. Also the feel of his home reflected on the mood. It was a warm and safe environment in paragraph @NUM1 it states, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, the endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm house."" @CAPS2 can really tell that he loved his home and family and the reflected upon the mood."	2	2		2																					
4267	5	"Growing up in this environment in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly spanish."	0	1		1																					
4268	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy and family-like.      The author goes to describe his family, which were loving but poor. His family supported him by growing up in a happy loving home. They cooked nice food, and invited the relatives over to eat. The author show that no matter if your rich or poor, you can still have a closely knit family.	2	2		2																					
4269	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir would be describe happy and thankful. I say that because the author talked about how his parents were caring and selfless. They always helped out people in need. The author loved how he grew up with his cuban culture and how he would never forget it. He said that was one house hold he would never forget.	2	2		2																					
4270	5	"The mood created by the author is that he is realy happy that his parents moved to america to live close to friends and family because in paragraph @NUM1 it says"" countless extended family members came and went -- and there was alway someone temporarily staying with us."""	1	1		1																					
4271	5	"I feel that the mood (s) created by the author in the memoir is happy, proud, and grateful. I think that the author makes the memoir feel happy because he is saying that his parents were kind and they worked hard and that made him happy I think.Another mood I think is he was proud. He said (in paragraph @NUM1) that growing up in his environment istilled a great sence of family. His family welcomed other refugees from cuba to celebrate their arrival to this country. Thanks to what he grew up in he learned the real definition of family.The last mood I feel the author created was he was grateful. He said in paragraph @NUM2 that ""I will always be grateful for my parents love and sacrifice. He is gratful to his parents and how they ""turned a simple house into a home"" (paragraph @NUM3). That's what I feel the mood (s) are in the memoir are."	4	2		3																					
4272	5	In this memoir the author creates a feeling of gratefulness. @PERSON1 is grateful of his parents unselfishness and his heritage. He loves his home country of Cuba. @PERSON1 is also thankful for his grandparents. He loves his home in @LOCATION1 and is grateful for growing up in @LOCATION1. He is also grateful that his grand parents came to @LOCATION1.	1	1		1																					
4273	5	"There is a mood created by the author in the memoir.One way in which the mood is created is by explaining how the warm life in the narrator's house was created. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, form the backdrop to life in our warm home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This helps create the mood of the memoir because it is explaining how the narrator grew up.Another way in which the mood is created is by showing how caring and selfless the narrator's parents are. ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This gave the memoir a light and happy mood.A third way in which the mood is created is by showing how friendly everyone was with each other. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs everywhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" The narrator explained how friendly and open everybody in the neighborhood was with one another.As you can see, the author of the memoir created a late mood in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4274	5	"In the memoir the authors tone is loving. The way he describes his Cuban heritage and culture is full of pride for being Cuban. In @LOCATION1 two he states that he is eternally grateful for having had his parents ""rich culinary skills and a love of cooking"" passed on to him. Then at the end in @LOCATION1 seven his tone is once again loving and grateful. In the very last sentence it is noticeable. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."""	2	2		2																					
4275	5	"In this memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", by Home: The Blueprints of our Lives, the mood created by the author is happy.The mood is happy because everyone in the memoir are enjoying their lives and their not worrying about anything. As explained in the memoir, even when @PERSON1 and Rawedia had to start their lives over entirely, they didnt hesitate. Their family were happy, they partied, and as said in paragraph @NUM1, they ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people they considered family."" In this memoir Narciso enjoyed his life and looked up to his parents for everything they did for him. In paragraph @NUM2 Narciso exclaimed that he will never forget how his parents turned that simple house into a home, which showed their happiness in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
4276	5	"In the memoir Narciso rodriguez by Home, the mood created by the @CAPS1 in the memoir is that growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life. but, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.  I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	3	2		3																					
4277	5	"The author does an excellent job for creating many moods in this memoir. One of the moods, is love. Love is a mood in this memoir because @PERSON1's parents took ten people who needed somewhere to stay, because they know that those people would do the same thing for them. Another example of love is when @PERSON1 says in paragraph @NUM1, ""they came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" The memoir also makes one feel very grateful for what they have, which, is another mood. It does this by having the author point out how little his house was, and how his parents did everything they could to give them a better life. It really makes one look back, and see how much their parents have done for them."	2	3		3																					
4278	5	Well first the authur feels happy and exsited but he also feels sad cause he is moving to @LOCATION1. In 1961 he was born but In that time he met a friend which was his Babysitter and she was his first friend she lived up stairs from them he has alot of family members but wen he moved to @LOCATION1 his mom and dad took his people that need a home Just until they can get back up on there feet he wants to see his grandparents that cant leave until 1970. But he told his mom and dad he will always be grateful to them for their love and sacrifice he often told them that what they did was much more courageous thing than he could have ever done he also often told them of his admiration for their strength and perseverance andt he thanked them	2	1		2																					
4279	5	"The mood would be loving and carring. When @CAPS1 was a child growing up in @LOCATION2, his parents treasrd familey and friends. They taught him to always lend a helping and and to alway keep his door open. ""Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was maid up of mostly spanish, cuban, and italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States."" It was a close knit comunity and everybody knew everybody. Nobody was a stranger. ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us"". His parent's instilled How important familey is and friends."	3	3		3																					
4280	5	The @CAPS1 created by the author in the memoir is Very necessary. I say this because I don't like any writing that doesn't have @CAPS1 swings. this author does a good job of showing the emotions of Narciso Rodriguez in their story. A place in the story where I really like the @CAPS1 swing is between @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @NUM2. I like this change because, it goes from talking about a landlord and his daughter to talking about @ORGANIZATION2's parents. I like that because, it creates a mode of @NUM3 different backgrounds on the two different @CAPS3 of People. It talks about how @PERSON1's Parents were imigrants and weren't raised well buts they wanted their son to have a better childhood life than them. On the other hand, the landlord and his daughter @LOCATION1 , were rich and Could do anything they wanted. I am just blown away by how this author changes his moods.	1	0		1																					
4281	5	"In the memoir 'Narciso Rodriguez' the mood of it was happy and was meant to sorta touch someone. In his memoir he explains something he found fun and amusing that he still does today ""a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore today)"". ""In our neighborhood despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity in friendship"" this shows the neighborhood he lived him was happy and united. ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language of the culture. They came selflessly"" this shows that he wanted the readers to know how caring and loving his parents were."	2	3		3																					
4282	5	"There is a warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1. This mood is portrayed in many ways. One way the mood is portrayed is by telling us about @PERSON1's parents. And how there home is always open or how theres always ton of people at the dinner table. Another way they portrayed this mood is by @PERSON1 stating ""there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity.... the demonstration of how important my friends and family are. This is how they show the warmth kind of family mood in this memoir, @PERSON1."	3	2		3																					
4283	5	The author of Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso Rodriguez made the @CAPS1 feel happy and welcome. When he talked about the different cultures and races coming together and becoming a solidarity made the @CAPS1 feel welcome to everyone no matter what race you are. When he talked about his Culture and house and having people over for dinner everynight just felt happy and welcome. When he showed his love for his home and culture his parents had shown him made the @CAPS1 feel uplifting. that is how Narciso Rodriguez created @CAPS1 in the memoir, by talking about happy uplifting topics.	2	2		2																					
4284	5	"The mood that the author gives through out this hole artical or, memoir is happiness and family. All during the memoir he speaks of how he cherished his family.

And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" the author keeps on saying how much he is thank ful to his parents and how he loves how they were able to give him all they had to offer. That is what he ment when he said he couldn never show how much it means to him. The mood in the memoir is love, family and happiness."	2	2		2																					
4285	5	The mood in the memoir is alot of things here are some. First it makes a warth feeling. It also makes a happy mood because he says that he cannot thank enough. For what they did for him. And lastly it makes you kind of sad because it talks about people that need help. And it says that they love cuba and wants to remember there heratige. There some moods that this story brings out.	1	1		1																					
4286	5	"By writing the story, the author created a mood full of warmth and comfort. The mood created in this story shows how family should be. When @PERSON1 says that ""they take anyone in until they are back on their feet"", this shows that they appreciate their family and they are all close. This shows that they care for one another contributes to the mood by showing love and warmth towards another person. A second way about the mood is when he talks about his kitchen and how much it means to him. When he talks about the love of culinary skills and cooking which is still with him today it creates a solemn mood that sets the tone of the story. Third, where he talks about his neighborhood. @PERSON1 talks about the immigrants in the area and how they come together with their different backgrounds. This shows that they show affection for one another and that everyone is the same. This sets the mood too by showing everybody needs to be nice to everyone. These three parts set the ""mood of the story."	3	3		3																					
4287	5	The mood is good and happy. In this artical the mood is peaceful and positive. It's a secsesful mood also great-full because @PERSON1 is greatful for everything.	1	1		1																					
4288	5	"In the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the author talks about the home that they grew up in and the sacrifice and selflessness that their parents have. The mood of this story is happy in the author really shows how much of the love their parents and what they did for them. In paragraph two when they talked about how they love Cuban music and the culinary skills that their parents had, that was passed on to them and that they love so much. Another example of the mood of the story is shown by paragraph four when they talked about all the people they had at their kitchen table and how they were so helpful to the people that they met through where they live. The mood of the article ""Narciso Rodriguez"" was happy and loving to all the people this person has ever met from that house."	3	3		3																					
4289	5	The mood created by this @CAPS1 is, It makes the reader think About his family And what they have sacrificed for you. And ot makes you feel warm @CAPS2 It makes you think of family and friends. And your culture. And It also makes you @CAPS3 thinking of All the @CAPS4 your family has to make for you.

4290	5	"The mood created is happiness & pride. Like in paragraph @NUM1, it says, ""community of honest, hardworking immigrants."" Being honest and hardworking are two qualities to have. And in paragraph @NUM2 ""they cpme to this country with such courage."" @CAPS1, courage is a good quality to have. So pride & happiness are the mood."	2	2		2																					
4291	5	The mood is grateful, because it shows how grateful he is for his house and all the people that come over and be his family.	1	1		1																					
4292	5	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is a loving one Rodriguez is looking back at all the great memories of himself and his ""family"" when @CAPS2 was young.When living in new @CAPS1 as a child, Rodriguez lived in a very loving home, and a very loving neighborhood. Rodriguez refers to the people living in his neighborhood as family, claiming ""... 'Family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" @CAPS2 always had neibors an friends over which @CAPS2 considered to be ""family."" The was alot of love in his neibors, and so @CAPS2 grew up with a lot of love around him. But, of course, @CAPS2 loves his parents the most.In this memoir Rodriguez is thanking his parents for being so selfless and loving him so much throuout his childhood. Rodriguez is looking back on how great of a childhood @CAPS2 had, living in a great loving neiborhood, with parents that love him alot.Narciso explains the true definition of family in this memoir, and thanks his parents for loving him as much as they did."	2	2		2																					
4293	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is very strong. Narciso's mood mostly has to do with his family, friends, and most importantly his culture. Narciso is very happy and lucky to be born in the United States and have a chance to grow up there. Second Narciso loves his home. He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is greatful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not. Also his ""real"" grandparents wich weren't his real grandparents because they were still in cuba. Those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4294	5	"The mood in the memoir by @PERSON1 is happy, loving, and upbeat or lively. Happiness is seen by the reader when he Is ex plaing the way many different cultures ""come together in great solidarity and friendship"" @PERSON1 is happy he grew up here and is happy with everything about his childhood in this neighborhood. The author loves everything about this neighborhood. @PERSON1 especially loves that there are always people around their table and extended family comes to see them. @PERSON1's writing is very lively and he writes with great passion. The fact that the author puts so much happiness, love and life into his memoir is what makes it so interesting to read and what makes the mood so fantastic."	3	2		3																					
4295	5	"In the memoir the mood that was created by the @CAPS1 was saying Family is the most important thing in life. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifise. That means he is saying that he will always love his parents and his family. The @CAPS1 is trying to say that it is better to have family than money because in this memoir it talks about his parents leaving Cuba with no money no job but for them being together it gave them hope and now they live in a @NUM1 room house with their family. With out family life would be much harder to deal with."	2	1		2																					
4296	5	I believe the mood of the memoir is happy and enlightening. I think this because @CAPS1 someone imagrate from a certain country of poverty or unjust laws this community or neighborhood will take you in. this community is made up of Cuban spanyards and italians all have left there homelands to persue a better life for either them, the family, for there kids In conclusion the mood of this memoir is happy because it is enlightening and welcome place to be.	1	2		2																					
4297	5	"The author's mood of this memoir is extremely thankful and appeciative. He said he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices, and mentions what struggles they had, beginning in a one room apartment then affording to move into a three room apartment for him to call home. He explains how his parents started their lives entirely over in @LOCATION1, and needed to take whatever work they could find. They were able to endure their hard times with the faith that this struggle would help lead themselves and their children into better times. The author had so much admiration of his parents strength and perseverance. He learned the true meaning of 'family"" and about how to love. He was really appreciative for all he had, and the lessons of generosity and how important family & friends are that his courageous parents had taught him, that had also become the basis of his life."	3	3		3																					
4298	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a family mood. Rodriguez talks about how family always visits. The memoir states ""countless extended family members came and went..."" (paragraph @NUM1). He also explains that family isn't always the people related to you. Rodriguez says that his neighborhood ""came together in great solidarity..."" (paragraph @NUM1). Rodriguez says that he is most grateful for his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Narciso Rodriguez really creates a mood filled with love, caring, and family."	3	3		3																					
4299	5	"In the @CAPS1 from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives,"" @PERSON2 creates a very distinct mood. I think the mood of the @CAPS1 is Warm, caring, comforting, and very loving. The author's home is very family oriented, but not to just blood family. His neighborhood was all family when ""Racism was the norm and segrigation prevailed."" When Narciso Rodriguez discribes this the @CAPS1 sounds comforting and loving. He @CAPS2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" This brings a happy, light feel to the article and coforting as well.When Rodriguez @CAPS2 ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" the mood changes a bit. Now it's admiring, grateful, and compationate. As Narciso Rodriguez discribes his parents Struggle so he could grow up @CAPS4 nicer than they did you can feel hes very grateful and loving. The mood is happy, loving, and full of compasion at this point This is the mood created by the @CAPS1 by @PERSON2 from ""Home: The blueprints of our lives"""	3	3		3																					
4300	5	In the memoir the author sets up a happy mood while remembering his child hood home. He only recounts good things and happy memories in the entire memoir. He also speak of cherished childhood memorys and how good his cummunity was and parents.	2	1		2																					
4301	5	The mood in the story is very happy. The author is thinking about all the good times he had growing up. He is talking about how he had such a good life in the house. How his parents came there as immigrants and made a life for themselves and then him. Another reason he has a happy mood is because he talks about his family coming to @LOCATION1. He talks about how his parents taught him how to cook. He thanked his parents because he was so happy they created a family not just a home.	2	2		2																					
4302	5	"And throughout the memoir there is a constant mood, which is happiness. In the beginning of the memoir, @PERSON1 describes his home, about how it started to how it became a wonderful ""home"". He said it had ""a passionate Cuban music"" and ""amazing aromas of cooking"". Then in paragraph @NUM1, @PERSON1 says that ""he loves his parents for their love and sacrifice""; and he continues saying how grateful he is toward them. Lastly in paragraph @NUM2, he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This is the mood expressed in the memoir."	2	2		2																					
4303	5	"In the memoir the author creates many moods with in it. In the text the first mood he created was caring because in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family knowing that they would do the same for us."" This shows caring because they would let anyone that was family and wouldn't care. The next mood he showed is being grateful because in paragraph @NUM2 he says"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"". This is him showing that he is grateful because he says it in the sentence and he also tells the reason why he is grateful to them. These are the moods the memoir created."	3	3		3																					
4304	5	I think in my opion is that the author was very comfortable with his words and his way of being human. His parents was originally from cuba, @CAPS1 was in to there culture nice to other in there surrounding. For an example @CAPS2 say It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the country and where I celebrated His first birthday.	1	1		1																					
4305	5	They author makes a mood like is other in this memoir. He creates a mood in which enstills @CAPS1 and praise for his parents.

He makes a mood of happiness in which will last for ever in his memories and the Kitchen.	1	1		1																					
4306	5	"I think the mood of this story is warm and loving. Narciso's Parents never had a big home in the United States but they turned a small house into a home.In a @NUM1 bedroom, two family house in @LOCATION1's parents created a traditional Cuban home. A lot of cooking hapened in the house. Family was always around which must've been fun, and all of this hapening with Cuban music playing in the back ground.

4308	5	In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he named the music that was playing and all the family that ate with them. Narciso also talked about them cooking. I think the moods peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. he only says the good things about them. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house.	2	1		2

The memoir was all about how Narciso Rodriguez admired his parents courage, selfishness, culture, heritage, strength, and perseverance.  Narciso said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" @CAPS1 also said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are.""

4312	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a sort of grateful, appreciative mood. Throughout the memoir, Narciso repeats how grateful he is to have such courageous parents.

They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind thier families, friends, and careers in the country they loved.""  this shows how grateful he is for his parents, to do all this, just to give him a better life.

Happieness is one of the mood because Narciso is pleased with parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and secrifice."".  @CAPS1 is one of the moods because all every one in the neighbor hood got along.

This feeling of family definitely helps to make the piece feel warm and happy."	3	3		3																					
4324	5	"I think the mood is suppost to be sad for many reasons. One reason is that he keeps saying how his house isnt a home untill the end. Such as ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Another reason is that his friends and family is all he got. Such as ""...how important family and friends are. Also because he had to move, so he didnt no anybody. Such as ""...Originaly from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956."	1	2		2

I think the mood created by the author is grateful because this is a memoir of all the good things in his life and all of the stuff he should be gratefull for having.	2	2		2																					
4334	5	In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he creates a happy and excited mood. This is because he is sharing family memories and those of his home. He is happy about them because of all of the good times he had in it. One event he was fond of at his house was his babysitter and first friend Alegria. Narciso shares times hes spent with Alegria and in doing so shows a mood of happiness. When the author talks about the kitchen and the Cuban music it brings an excited mood to my head. I imagine some exotic food cooking with a sweet warm smell and parents talking over the passionate Cuban Music. Narciso Rodriguez's life seems to be one that is very interesting and exciting. I wonder what he's doing now.	3	2		3

4340	5	The mood created by the auther is that of the american dream. It is a very happy and successfull theme with roots in the hearts of millions of immigrants that hopefully had simallar stories. In each paragraph there lines that have relation With freind being family and how his home was phisically quant but emotionally it was a place of love. That enhances the mood of happines in the story. Also the fact that in the story racism and segration were set aside and neighbors were relatives because of who they were not were they came from. That is what everyone loves to hear and makes the mood hope that the whole nation will act like that. lastly the story tells times how the parents sacrifice for their sons better life. That has probably touched most of reader close to hom so the mood would now becom very serious. This short memoir is a great story to bring you mood from sad to hopefull and thankfull that you live in a place you can call home.	3	3		3

I believe that Narciso Rodriguez likes to look at everything in a happy, light mood no matter what it is."	2	2		2																					
4342	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one. A reason why I think this is by talking about how he and his neighbors (of different descent) All got along very well in solidarity with one another which creates a sense of love. Also when he talks about happy times like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen they are having a good time, laughing, and listening to Cuban Music.

4354	5	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is certain mood. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful)."" I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also says how grateful he is for his parents. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good."	3	3		3																					
4355	5	"Narciso was very grateful of his parents they had love, happiness, depression and maybe more. The author's memoir was sad, but also a loving memoir. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" Narciso loved his parents for making a simple house into a traditional Cuban home. He also loved how his parents made their own home. ""My mother and father had to come to this country with such corage, they came selflessly as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."" Narciso  was so grateful he thank his parent every day that created love. ""It was this simple house that my parents celebrate my first birthday"". He kept the house as a memoir to remind himself of how he came to america. it was loving, caring, and also cheerful."	3	3		3

Rodriguez really does a fantastic job of creating a pleasant mood in this memoir."	2	2		2																					
4357	5	"In this memoir written by fashion designer Narciso Rodriguez, there is a certain tone conveyed by his writing about his childhood home. Here is what is.Many people who immigrate from a poorer country like Cuba are quite poor when living here because like Narciso says in the bottom of paragraph @NUM1, ""In the United States, [my parents] had to start their lifes over entirely, taking what ever work they could find."" @CAPS1 of talking about the hardships, Narciso focused on the fact that he was raised into a wonderfly cultural enviorment. An enviorment filled with his ""family"". When he says family he doesn't meen just her biological family. He means all the people that he spends time with and has a deep connection with. Therefore, the mood that Narciso Rodriguez is conveying in this memoir is a warm, greatful, and happy tone. A tone that shows that he will never forget all the things his parents gave up so that he could have a good childhood. The tone also shows that now, even though he is a famous fashion designer and most likely is quite wealthy, he will never forget how his parents ""turned the simple house into a home."" This is what the tone of this memoir is."	3	3		3																					
4358	5	"The mood of the author is happy. The mood is happy because they doesn't really mention any negative thoughts or feelings at all. He mentions throughout the story, how he is so grateful for his family, like his mom and dad. He talks about himself being cuban, and how proud he is to be Cuban. The narrator has a bunch of good thoughts, about his mother and father. He mentioned in the story ""I will alway be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. He always tells his parents of how proud he is of them, and mentions how their basically an @CAPS1."	2	2		2																					
4359	5	The mood of the author in the memoir is that the author was there and lived there so, the mood was really so, the author was happy. Happy that the authors parents gave him a @CAPS1 and also gave them freedom to start over for there son.	1	1		1																					
4360	5	The mood in the memoir swifts throughout the story.  First is that in the begin Narciso wasn't sure he would like moving to @LOCATION1 because it was so different.  But that changed when they started having family over and also using there imagination to decorte there house.  Next is that the mood change in the middle of the memoir when they rellized you can have just a good life in @LOCATION1 then you can anywhere else.  Also, by them having there family with them while in @LOCATION1 made there moods more positive.  Lastly the family's mood was negitive when having to move to @LOCATION1, but once they were there and made there house into a home there mood change immeditly and they were happy in @LOCATION2.  Thats the mood created by the author in the memoir.	1	2		2																					
4361	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a very specific mood. He talks about family, love, and home. For example, Narciso says that the heart of his home was the kitchen, and there was always passionate Cuban music playing. In his neighborhood, Narciso says that ""cultures came together"" and that his parents ""always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" I can tell how important friends and family are to Narciso and his family and how welcoming and caring they are. Narciso believes that his home was filled with ""not just scent and music, but life and love."" I believe the mood of his house was not only obvious to Narciso, but to his neighbors and family too."	2	3		3																					
4362	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates a very calm and grateful mood from beginning to end in his memior. First of all, he describes the selflessness of his parents. Narciso explains that ""they had to start their lives over entirely."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) when they left Cuba for the United States. He understands that they only left for his benefit, and he appreciates that. Also, Narciso is thankful that although his parents moved to the United States, they kept their Cuban traditions. In Narciso's three room apartment, ""Passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen"" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). Lastly, Narciso expresses his appreciation, and strengthens the mood by defining what a home is. He claims that he ""will never forget how [his] parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@CAPS1 @NUM3). For these, Narciso is grateful for, and his appreciation creates a calm, inviting, and grateful mood."	3	3		3																					
4363	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy. It is happy because she said growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative. This is saying that she is happy for what she has in her life. She is saying that she has a nice family, friends, and a good home"	1	1		1																					
4364	5	The author of this memoir creates a very calm mood. This article isn't anywhat exciting at all. All it is doing is explaining this child's life. This memoir, to me, was like taking a list of things and putting them into a full paper. The author did not create any kind of mood that interested me to keep reading of this topic. This memoir did however express a lot of feelings though. It expressed how grateful this kid was for his parents and his Cuban descent. Although this memoir had a calm (and slightly boring) mood, the author's ability to reveal information was very deep and insightful.	1	2		2																					
4365	5	"one mood of this memoir was that of a traditional Cuban home. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM1, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" A second mood of this memoir was the impression of a Cuban family who faced my hardships. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM2 ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" The last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about: love, loyalty and friendship. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM3 ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	3	3		3																					
4366	5	The mood by the author in the memoir is touching because i feel like memory story. This story is telling yu how to be memorized about the story and it makes u cry a little bit. I kind the like it a little bit because its about cuban peoples. I think my father knows People from cuban and I think he knows their culture.	0	1		0																					
4367	5	"The mood of the @CAPS1 is happy. In the memior, Narciso Rodriguez describes the happy and fun times of living in her small home in New Jersey. He describes how his family, which consisted of her mother and father turned their @CAPS2 house into a cuban home and opened the doors to other refugees that were going through difficult times. In the last @CAPS4 Narciso explains that this is the home where all her first birthdays happened, and where her friends and family would gather. The message the @CAPS1 was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be. The reason I know the @CAPS3 mood was happy is because, she had wonderful people in her life. Her home wasn't big and fancy but as described in @CAPS4 @NUM1 ""It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees."" In this @CAPS5 he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love. Narciso's once simple house had turned into a home, filled with friends and family."	3	3		3																					
4368	5	"In the memoir I think the mood the author creates is love for family. In paragraph @ORGANIZATION1 explains that family has nothing to do with being a ""blood"" relative. He means that you don't have to be related to someone to consider them family. In paragraph @NUM1, Narciso says that so many extended family members come in and out of his house all the time and they are always treated lovingly. I think that the fact that Rodriguez's parents brought in so many people to their home is inspiring because it really does show the love and warmth the family has to bring in refugees from places other than america, plus their family!"	2	3		3																					
4369	5	"In the memoir, the mood created @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez is welcoming and cheerful. One example that describes this is from paragraph @NUM1. This is where he described his neighborhood, saying ""In our neighberhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" @CAPS1 this he meant that no matter what background their neighbors were from, they always welcomed each other. Also, in paragraph @NUM2, the author says that his parents came to @LOCATION1 selflessly, to let their child have a better life even though they were leaving their home country. Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, Rodriguez describes the warm memorice of his home, where he had birthdays, parties, and family. He said that there was the scent of life and love in the air. For this he is forever grateful to his parents because he learned the true meaning of ""family."""	3	3		3																					
4370	5	The mood of the memoir is nostalgic and happiness. He tells the readers about his econimic backgrounds. He also explains about his family and what they meant to him. then, he talks about his house and about how he had he had his birthday there.

In the memoir, it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso loves his parents and the way they raised him."	1	2		2																					
4372	5	The mood in this story is very happy. In this answer I will show how he created it.Firstly, the author always had a good mood no matter what happened or what his parents didn't do. He had great memories of the kitchen smelling good. He also loved his Cuban music.Secondly, he showed how thankful he was towards his family for bringing him into this world and caring for them.These two things show how Narciso Rodriguez made this a happy passage to read.	3	2		3																					
4373	5	The author of this memoir created many moods. One mood that was felt is happiness because of the way Narciso Rodriguez described his home to be a place of childhood innocence, family, friends, and endless celebrations. Another mood is gratitude for I have never given up my friends, family, and home and Narciso Rodriguez's parents had to give up their friends, family, and home in Cuba to support Narciso. The last mood is admiration at the fact the Narciso Rodriguez and his friends and family could feel so happy even though racism and segregation were a part of the @PERSON2, along with the fact that they were going through financial trouble. In this memoir, Narciso Rodriguez made the readers feel many moods while telling his insperational story.	3	3		3																					
4374	5	I think the mood in this storie was mostly happy and grateful. Because he loved living there with his parents and having family members around and being able to learn about his heritage. And learn about all the cooking. He seems to have had a very nice childhood and has always thanked his parents for that. they gave up everything to go to america to raise him and he seens very grateful.	1	2		2																					
4375	5	"In this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, she uses key terms and phrases to discuss the mood in paragraph @NUM1 she says, ""Cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This line puts a clear picture in your head of what it would be like to have lived in that home. Another time Narciso Rodriguez puts a clear picture of the setting in your head is in paragraph @NUM2. She is stating where her parents must live and says, ""braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics."" This line puts the setting in my mind which makes it more clear to picture the home and setting. Narciso does a great job describing the mood of each location."	2	0		1

"	1	2		2																					
4383	5	The mood the author created in the memoir was happy and joyful. The author explains were he lived as a child very vividly. from the air mixed with the aromas of cuban food to to cuban music the author still loves today. It seems like he had a good childhood. He says his parent were selfless and took in refugees in their home. It gives this story a warm feel like it could almost be your mom or dad.

4384	5	In the memoir what was the mood created by the author.First, I feel that the mood created by the author is both happy and sad. I feel that they are sad because they moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 where they left all of their friends and family and careers they loved behind. They also struggled both personaly and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. Although they were sad I also felt that they were happy. I thought this because even though they moved from the place they loved they have one thing that made them feel at home. I think that it was there home and each other because they have there home Just as they like like, like when they were back home. I felt that the mood was both happy and sad in this memoir.	2	3		3																					
4385	5	"I think the mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir is that he is proud and grateful. One way he shows he is grateful is by telling the readers how his parents sacrificed themselves to give him a better life. He says: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Which shows that in addition to being grateful to them for sacrificing themselves, he is grateful for all the love and care they gave to him as he grew up. Narciso Rodriguez shows he is proud by saying ""my Mother and father had come to this country with such courage� I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done"". This shows Narciso Rodriguez is proud to have parents that are strong and brave and willing to leave ""behind their families, friends, and careers, and the country they loved"" all for him. So I hope you now see how Narciso Rodriguez's memoir creates a mood that reflects how he is proud of and grateful to his parents."	4	2		3																					
4386	5	"The mood that was crea ted by the author was love, and inspiration The mood was love because throughout the whole story he told his parents that he loved them and was proud of them. he feels proud of them because of all they do for him and the family. So he is proud of them. he is also greatful to have parents like this because they do so much for him they cook, clean, and keep a roof over his head and keep him protected. The other mood that is created for me is inspiration this mood is created because of what he says ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perservirence. this means that he is proud of his parents and he is thankful for what they do for him, he says tha he is thankful for all they have sacrificed. These are some examples of the mood that was created."	3	3		3																					
4387	5	The mood created by the author is love and @CAPS1. Because the author talks about how growing up was. The author helps babysitting. And the author sounds like a nice person. thats what the author's mood is.	1	1		1

In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez expresses a thankfull mood. In paragraph @NUM1, there is an example of this thankfullness: ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" (Rodriguez, paragraph @NUM1).    This proves how Narciso acknowledges the sacrifice of his parents, and thanks them for it. In paragraph @NUM3, Narciso states that, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have ever done."" (paragraph @NUM3). This proves how Narciso Rodriguez thanks his parents for what they did for him.      In conclusion, in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez creates a thank ful mood."	3	3		3

4390	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy mood, that's sort of calming. The author explains how the house was very comfortable for him. Narsico explains how his parents were caring and selfless all the time. I think that creates a very calming are caring mood. Also in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" which again creates a caring mood."	2	2		2																					
4391	5	The mood the author creeted is gratefulness. @CAPS1 is grateful for many things @CAPS1's grateful for culinary skills and love of cooking that was passed on from her parents. @CAPS1 is grateful of her close-knit community, who are honest hard working immigrants who always extend a helping hand.

4392	5	"This memoir really sets of mood of love and comfort. It does this when he tells us that his parents immigrated just for him. Than it keeps that mood going when he tells us about all the people that come over regularly for dinner. His parents loved him and made a great inviorment for him like he said, they ""made a house a home"""	1	2		2																					
4393	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez the mood created by the author was powerful. It had made one feel as though you were accualy there. The author had explained in detail his living enviornment of a small house in a community of other immigreants like them selvs who had band to geather in rough times. During the memoir the author tells about his cuban background, ""Passionate Cuban Music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS1 also tells about @CAPS1's deffinition of family. the ones in his community that wernt just blood related but the neighbors who looked after each other. The author sets the mood of love for his culture and his family within their community. and how his simple three room apartment has become a home."	3	3		3																					
4394	5	Throughout the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the author creates many different moods. As a ready I got a large variaty of moods from the author. Such as sorrow for the family and what they went through, pitty for the children and how they watched their parents struggle for them, yet at the same time they benefited from watching because it made them stronger. Though throughout the memoir, among all the of the other moods that are potraid, there is the mood of eternal gratefulness. The fact that the parents went through so much just for their kids to have a better times and a promising future is beyond the relm of words. Words do not exist that can describe how amazing those parents are to do what they did. This is the mood, and moods, that are potraid in this memoir.	0	2		2																					
4395	5	"The mood in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is that of a happy mood. The memoir is about a cuban family who want to live in america to give their son a better life. Their parents gave up their jobs of being scientists for their son. The story is in a good because their is true love being spread. Narciso Rodriguez lived in a happy mood."	1	1		1																					
4396	5	"The mood of this story was a happy and a reflective one. Many times during the story, especially in paragraph @NUM1, he told us what his parents did, but also after almost every sentence in parentheses he would say how much it meain to him. For example, he says how his parents cooked, and after that: (and for which I am eternally grateful). This shows how much he loved his parents for passing on their culinary skillsIn one paragraph, he starts off the sentence with: ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again shows the mood of greatfullness, happiness, and reflectiveness from the story."	2	2		2																					
4397	5	"The mood that the author created throughout the course of the memoir was a sense of happiness but also family. This family moved from Cuba to @LOCATION1 with no clue what to expect, no prior knowledge of the culture or anything else. All they had was eachother which gives off a great sense of family. Then there is the happiness factor, throughout the story no matter what the sircumstances they seem to be happy because they had family. In the story it says that ""my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This lets me know that he does view his house as a home and that means he is happy."	2	3		3																					
4398	5	"The mood in the memoir changes. But overall the mood is sad. It tells how Narciso's parents give up what they had for the better of their children. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their Children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" Also, most of Narciso's family did not have homes for a while which is sad because they do not have a place to call home."" Countless extended family members came and went-and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet."" Narciso's parents gave up everything for him to have a better life. They left the place they were most @CAPS1 in for him. ""The faith that is struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times."""	2	3		3

4400	5	"In this memoir the author creates a mood which- for me, sucked me into this memoir. I think Narciso Rodriguez created a ""home sweet home"" mood. I say this because when he says, ""within it walls, my young parents created our tradition cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" it reminds me of my family and how my family loves cooking puerto @CAPS1 food. The smell is like, ""your home"". In my home everyone's execpted and even if you're not realated. Narciso also says this in his memoir. also.Narciso is very grateful in his memoir because his parents immigrated to have a better life. this creates a loving and family mood. Narciso says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many thing I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Now that they've immigrated Narciso Rodriguez will never forget his childhood home. There are many moods in this memoir."	3	2		3																					
4401	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood is kind of happy, sad and is greatful. Narciso is very happy because he usually gets to spend time with ""family"" and is also very happy that his family hes with him and that more family will come from cuba in a few years. He is sad because he cant see his grandfather and because his parents didn't get to live such a great life as him. He is greatful for being alive for his parents doing everything for him bringing him to @LOCATION1 and he's greatful because he got to live such a great life because of his parents. That was the mood of the memoir."	2	1		2																					
4402	5	The mood the author Narciso Rodriguez, creates in this memoir is a very apreciative and thankful tone. In this memoir is expressing how thankful he is for his parents moving to @LOCATION1 to give him a better life. He shows apreciation to them for their selfless and brave deeds. At one point in this memoir he says to his parents that what they did was a much more courageous thing the he could have ever done. He tells his parents this to let them know how brave he thinks they are.	2	2		2																					
4403	5	His mood was happiness. Being with his family, sharing, being gathered with your family, having great times with your family members, taking chances with your family, explore the world, never be afraid to go somewhere new, express your feelings to each other, always be there for each other, being yourself, don't change and take risks to a different state. Don't be afraid to share with one another and always be there for one another and always be yourself, express yourself how you want to be and don't change for anybody,	1	1		1																					
4404	5	The mood created by the author, in my opinion, is a happy mood. It is happy because the author gives the reader a great explanation and description of his life at home. The author created a happy mood also because it showed that his parents were not selfish and that they wanted their children to have a better life in the United States. They had left their whole family behind. Also, Narciso talks about how he and the rest of the immigrants had to deal with racism. But, they were still happy and determined to be, so they all work together happily and in unity. I think it shows that the author not only had family in a nice house, but in the neighborhood as well. The story gave me a sense of a really good, close-knit family. Including the importance of one.	2	2		2																					
4405	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is pride. I think that the mood created by the author is pride because in paragraph two it says ""...culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful)."" I think it's an example of pride because it says ""for which I am eternally grateful."" showing that will always be proud of Cuban food.  Another reason why I think the mood is pride is in paragraph @NUM1 it says ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day)..."" I also think that is an example of pride because it shows that he was raised with Cuban music and he still loves to listen to it."	2	2		2																					
4406	5	"The mood in the memoir is very uplifting. The story is mostly about how much the author appreciates his family and what his parents have done for him. It also shows how happy the family was and how everyone around them were family iregardless of where they immigrated from. In paragraph @NUM1 he says ""Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative""."	2	2		2																					
4407	5	"The author created several different moods in this memoir. The main mood that the author was trying to creat was thankfulness. In paragraph @NUM1 it says,"" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows thankfulness because she's saying thank you to her parents and everything they have done for her. Also, she is thankful because she started to realize how hard her mom and dad had to work for the house and put food on the table. The main mood of the story is clearly thankfulness."	2	2		2																					
4408	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is love and appreciation. Narciso appreciated all that his parents did for him. They gave up a home in Cuba for him, their job and even happiness. Love because they all loved each other alot family meant alot to the family. they said family is people who care for one another even if they are not blood related. it doesnt matter.

Also, the paragraph is very informative, telling about his parents imigrating to the @ORGANIZATION1 from Cuba and how they were financially poor + could not afford a fancy home like they could in Cuba.An informal paragraph in the memoir is a paragraph like number six where he is describing how thankful he is for his parents being as selfless and giving as they are.

4473	5	"The aurther talks about home and family which would be a calm, caring, and happy mood. The author created these moods by talking about memories and how her parents moved from cuba to give there child a better life and how they take in family mebers in need until they get back on there feet.

4475	5	I beleive the mood that sets off in the beggining of the story is how in her house cuban music and great aroma's From @CAPS1's @CAPS2 through the air, I also think that it gives picture of laughter and happiness, And I think that throughout the story @CAPS3 tells that @CAPS3 relizes through spending time with community that his parents are teaching him, Just because someone isn't blood related dosent mean they can't be lik family as said in the package, There teaching him that It Is also people that love you and care about you. As @CAPS3 continues through the passage It says that his family is all ways open to take care of people that they love and need help. @CAPS3 soon relizes that all his family gave up from their old lives was so that they could provide a nice home for him and teach him a valuable lesson in Life the true meaning of family.	3	3		3																					
4476	5	In the memoir this is how the author created the mood, he tells of how his parents lived in a house where it was very poor at that time. His parents immigrated to @LOCATION1 where Narciso was born. he was raised in the ghetto. When he was living here it was during the time of racism and segregation.

4479	5	The author creates many moods in the story. While reading this story I felt happy, sometimes sad and overall it made me feel good.The mood that the author is trying to sel is happieness and unity. even though many cultures and ethnic backgrounds were in his neiborhood they all came together as one. Then at other times I felt sad because he grew up with racism still in america. The story makes me feel good because the author is trying to say that it is not the materialistic things that make you happy it is the family and freinds that surroud you every single day.	2	2		2																					
4480	5	"I believe the was more of a ""thank you"" in the memoir and here a three reasons. I think Narciso Rodriguez is thanking his parents for making him have a good childhood.

In the excerpt ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 Narciso is forever grateful to his parents.

The way he felt about her childhood was potrayed beautifully in this piece and that really helped the reader get into the happiness and community like feel. Her gratefullness potrayed into the mood and made the entire piece fun to read.	2	2		2																					
4486	5	The main mood that is potrayed by the author is coziness or family, because his parents gave up everything and came to the United States so that Narciso could have a great childhood and he did. Narciso's parents turned a small apartment into a happy comforting place that people would go to for a happy reunion matter where they were from. The single force of staying over brought people together. That is how Narciso grew up with and with that was lucky and grateful.	1	2		2

Overall, Rodriguez creates a loving mood of togetherness."	3	3		3																					
4491	5	In this paragraph I'm going to tell you the mood created by the author in the memoir I just read. One mood that the author had was happy. The reason why I said that is because everytime he spoke about being Cuban or about his family, he spoke with this joy or pride in his voice. Also when he was talking about Spanish, Italian and Cuban all like being a family. Another mood he had was kind of sad. The reason why I say that is because when he was talking about how he couldn't his a real grandparents until 1970. He sounded a little deppressed about that. I also feel that he is a very happy man for the rest of the memoir. Those are the moods that I think the author created during the memoir.	2	2		2																					
4492	5	"The mood in this memoir changes throughout the story. First off, the mood starts with being friendly. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."" This tells us everyone in the neighborhood is nice. In the middle of the story, the mood is strong and determined. ""They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters."" This tells the people had to stay strong through hard times. Lastly, the end of the story is greatful. ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" This tells how the narrator is thankful. All in all, the moods in the story fit together nicely."	3	3		3

In conclusion, the auther creates a mood in the memior in many ways."	2	2		2																					
4495	5	the mood of the @CAPS1 in the article is like kind of happiness and @CAPS2, relax, and grateful. Because their grandparents are coming from Cuba. Narciso Rodriguez feels like being an immigrant from Cuba and making a family in the United States is hard. Because you have to start your whole life over so you can get a job and provide for your family. This is what I think the mood of the article is about in the memoir.	1	2		2																					
4496	5	In this memoir, the mood is very light hearted and kind. It gives you a feeling of peace and community.Several times the author tries to show appreciation. Not for any one thing in particular, just gratitude. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he puts phrases in parentheses for no reason other than to show gratitude for his life as a child. As a result of this, while reading you get a feeling of peace and kindness.Because of his repeated display of gratitude, the mood is light hearted and unserious.	2	1		2																					
4497	5	"The author creates a unique mood in the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives. The mood is loving/caring/kind from what the authors saying about his memories.

4498	5	The mood that the author created in the memoir is a very loving and caring one. This is because the author tells what his parents gave up just for him to have a good life. That means his parents really loved him because they wanted him to grow up and have a good life. And that was something that they could find in @LOCATION1. It is very caring of them because when they moved to @LOCATION1 not only did they look after their baby, but other people that needed help as well. To them everyone in their neighborhood was their family and they all looked after each other. The mood is really both loving and caring because it shows how an group of people are so close, that they love and care for each other as one family. No matter what even in hard times one of them will always have their door open for them, and they can always relay on them. That is what family is about.	2	3		2																					
4499	5	The mood created by the author in the memior is very pleasant, proud and happy.

By growing up in such a wonderful place he will always never forget how his parents turned his simple house into a home.	2	2		2																					
4500	5	In this memoir, the auther creats a mood. The mood that this author creates is the gratefulness. The reason that I say gratefulness is because Narciso Rodriguez is so greatful, and so happy to have two loving, caring, selfless parents. He's grateful to have not only a house, but a warm, cozy home, where he's grown up in and had so many memories. He is grateful to have all the perks of a traditional cuban home, with the food, the music, and all of the people Narciso is grateful that his Parents basically just gave up their own lives and dropped everything, so that he could have a better life. Nariso cannot imagine @CAPS1 to @LOCATION1 not knowing the language, not knowing anything, and leaving everything he knows behind. However that's what his parents did. they sacrificed so much for him. and he appreciates that more than anything. I think that the mood that the author chose for this story was perfect.	3	3		3																					
4501	5	I think in some parts @CAPS1 was happy. And then is other parts @CAPS1 was sad because @CAPS1 is talking about her first house in america. @CAPS1 is happy because @CAPS1 can look back on the memories and be happy.	1	1		1																					
4502	5	"The mood of this memoir is @CAPS1. I say this @CAPS2 his family always let people from the neighbor hood come over and they were like family. His parents let people stay with them ""until they got back on their feet."" @CAPS3 admired his parents for their ""strength and perseverance"". Through everything they had been through."	2	2		2																					
4503	5	A mood for the memoir would be redeaming. It would be a redeaming mood because it talks about strugles like being an immagrent and being poor. It also talks about how a community that is going through the same strugles can come together and help each other out. The author also mentions how her parents sacrificed a lot to help her acomplish what she has become today. Since there are tradteties that help the author lead to success it would be a redeaming mood.	1	2		2																					
4504	5	The mood in this memoir is that Narciso is happy and very grateful for his parents sacrafices and willpower to make Narciso's life better and do give him more opportunitys in his life.	1	1		1																					
4505	5	The mood of the @CAPS1 is @CAPS2 and happy because Narciso Rodriguez parents immagrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1. The parents lived in a one room apartment for one year and when Narciso Rodriguez was born They moved in a @NUM1 room house. The parants try to make the house as @CAPS3 can be.	0	0		0																					
4506	5	The mood set by the author is very solemn. He started by telling the scenery he lived in during a time of segregation. That was hard because he was Cuban. He didn't have a lot of money, and lived in an apartment. His life was like a somewhat below avereage life today.Towards the middle the memoir was still serious but happier in a sense. It was happier because we Know that he could have more life opportunities in @LOCATION1. He grew up and actually met people and made friends. Also he had a caring family that did what they could to make his life easier for him. He made the memoir and nice and passionate.The moods started off a bit shaky and very serious. Then he got into a happier mood by telling how his parent and family were good to him. It ended in the same mood started in the middle of the passage, happy.	2	2		2																					
4507	5	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is a comfortable. It's comfortable because as I read the memoir it made me think of my own home life. And how important my family is to me. It also allowed to see how full and good his was to. I mean I love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells. Also, the wonderfull music that played and the people that always came over to visit. And all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another. That's the feeling I get when I read Narciso Rodriguez's memoir.	2	3		3																					
4508	5	"In the memoir the mood is very loving, @CAPS1, and thankfull. The mood is loving in many different ways. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.""

4509	5	The mood is memorable because he loves remebering everything that he did in his childhood. Also he also put the memories that he really like in parentheses. Also he thanked everybody on what he did in his lifetime. That is why memorable is a memory in his lifetime.	1	1		1																					
4510	5	The mood created by The @CAPS1 in The memoir is soothing and @CAPS2. I explains how @CAPS2 Narciso is at his parents house. The passage also explains how many friends he has. Narciso is grateful of his heritage which help set a good mood.	1	1		1																					
4511	5	In the memoir a @NUM1 year old man Narciso Rodriguez, Sr. good affored to move to the modest, three-room apartment soon called home. (@CAPS1 @NUM2) In 1961 he was born in a simple house in Newark, New Jersey. @PERSON1, Sr. was a mood like man he was greatful, kind, traditional, and happy.

4512	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, the author explains the true meaning of family and home. The mood is extremely deep and pearsonal as he describes the love and selflessness his family expressed. He explains that his mother and father emigrated from Cuba and moved to @LOCATION1 so that Narciso, their son, would have a better, successful life. Reading this memoir, I can picture Narciso getting very emotional expressing how grateful he is for his parents and family. He explains, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home"" (@NUM1). This sentence and last few paragraphs change the mood a great deal. It went from happy, appreciation, and an explanation of his life to deep, incredibly personal, and to his complete thoughts. Narciso had a great love and admiration for his family and friends like most people should be able to experience like Narciso writes about in his memoir."	2	3		3																					
4513	5	The mood created by the author was a very unique one. The author was remembering and charising the memorys he had of his old home. He described his home by saying how brave and courageous his parents were to give him a better life also how his family was so rich in culture and how his family and neighbors would always visit because times were tough but the authors parents never turned them down.

4515	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, Narciso Rodriguez creates a powerful mood for the reader. First, right of the bat I felt love and thoughtfulness, which I still felt throughout the story. ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" This made me think of my parents immediately. My father gave up his career and my mother gave up her family to give me and my brothers a better life. This feeling is without words. I can't describe the level of gratefulness I feel, just as Narciso does. Secondly, the admiration I shared with Narciso. She described her parents well enough to put me in her shoes. ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS1 thanked them repeatedly."" What her parents did for her was incredible and something to learn from. From Narciso's story, I got a sense of admiration, greatfulness, and connection, which I believe are the moods she created throughout his story."	2	3		3																					
4516	5	His mood was like happy and unsatisfying at the same time. They also say like how his/her life is so I think this book is good to. Or we can say article. It's like all about how his/her life story is.	0	0		0																					
4517	5	"The mood that the author created in this memoir was love and gratefullness. The author is trying to get their message across about how much a family is bonded together and how much there is to be thankful for. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This shows how much love the author has to be grateful for. He is also trying to say that there is no way to express his emotions and love to his parents. ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" The authors main point is to thank their parents for everything they have done. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"""	3	3		3																					
4518	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love, happiness, and self lessness. The of the memoir that emphasized the mood of love was when the author mentioned that, ""It was here where I learned the true defonition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbor hood or the many things I learned there about how to love."" The mood for that exerpt was love because it explains how much he cared for his family and neighbors. There were many exerpts in this memoir that gave the mood selfless ness, As such, ""They came self lessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers, in the country they love."" This indacates selflessness by explaining how they left behind their jobs, family, and friends, all to give their children what was best for them. The overall mood of the story was happy because it explained their happiness, struggle, courage, good outcome, and beloved memories."	3	3		3																					
4519	5	The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The mood was grateful because Narciso was glad his parents moved to the @LOCATION1 and started their wonderful home. Narciso was grateful of this because he grew up in an environment he loved.                                                                                                                                                     The mood created by the author is happy. The mood is happy because Narciso is happy that he grew up around people who loved him. This made him happy because he knew that he was safe and loved with these people. When his community of differences came together to form one community, this made Narciso happy. The mood is both grateful and happy. I would also be grateful for this, happiness is key to having friendships and famalies.	3	2		2																					
4520	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is set to reflect family values and memories. For example in paragraph @NUM1 she explains that her family is From Cuba and they raised her in a replica of a traditional Cuban home. She tells us that her parents bolth cook traditional Cuban foods and teach her how to cook as well. Then another example is from paragraph @NUM2 when she tells us that her family stays with her a lot, such as uncles aunts, cousins, grandparents, they @CAPS1 stay whith her until they are able to get on their feet again. Finaly in paragraph @NUM3, @NUM4 and @NUM5 It explains the sacrifice that her parents had to give in order to start a new life in the US, and about how her familly takes in other refuges and also about how she will never forget her parents and all the memories that go along with the house.	2	3		3

The kin Narciso was thankful because his parents let other people into the home untill they have somewhere elese they can call home. He is also thankful that he got his parents marvilous culinary skills so he can cook very well. He is also thankful for his parents love and sacrifice. The mood that we are suppose to get is a happy yet calm mood well we read this because Their is nothing to exciting but their is some parts where you get happy for what they did and you feel calm because as I said their is nothing really jumping out at you.  it is just a life story.	3	3		3																					
4524	5	The mood the author created in the memoir was joyful and optimistic. In the memoir, the author describes his home and how even though the house wasn't much, his parents made it feel inviting and comfortable. In his neighborhood, all the people were friends and took care of each other when they needed help. The author's home reflected the Cuban culture because of his parents. The author describes the hardships his parents had to go through like adjusting to a colder climate in not getting good jobs. Even though they had their own troubles, they were selfless and didn't let their problems get to them.

He is forever greatful.	2	1		2																					
4526	5	"In the memoir, ""@PERSON1,"" by Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives, The mood is set right from the beginning. The first thing said to Start the mood was, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am extremely grateful.)"" This shows the author is grateful and happy. The memoir also said, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This shows how the author is very proud. Also lastly the memoir mentions, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" This again saw how grateful the author is. In this passage the mood is set to be grateful, happy, and loving right from the start."	3	3		3																					
4527	5	The mood this memoir created was a warm greatful feeling, with his praising for his parents and saying how much he loves his tiny home in his hometown and how greatful he is for his parent's selflessness.	1	2		2																					
4528	5	The mood of this memior is slightly diffucult, somewhat depresing, yet gratefulness and now I am going to explain to you how. The mood is slightly diffucult and depressing because there is a different culture and a brand new language. Also in the united states you have to have get a new job. This short story is also gratefull because you have a amazing oppertunity to start a very better life and get a great education.	1	1		1																					
4529	5	The title of the story is Narciso Rodriguez. The authro is the @CAPS1 Narciso Rodriguez The mood I think is this story the author gave was pretty good. The author knew when to be excited and knew when to not be excited and he did a good story. The author put in explition marks in when the author was happy or sad. So to me I think this was a good story and I like it. The mood went right with it.	1	1		1																					
4530	5	The author creates a grateful mood. The author writes about how his parents had good jobs in Cuba but left everything to give their children better lives. He also writes about how he grew up, which is parents teaching him about music, cooking, and family. His parents never got the jobs they deserved because of the barriers to work for their children. The author is grateful for the things parents did for him so he could get a better life.	2	2		2																					
4531	5	"The mood created by the author of the memior exposed various emotions and contrast. In paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, the author talks alot about culture, he explains how they could not live without having their practice, in their lives. ""Rich culinary Skills and the love of cooking (and for which I am internally grateful). Passionat Cuban music (which I adore to this day) ...""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity"". Another mood the author captures is greatfullness. In paragraph six the author explains how he is so grateful for the strength and courage his parents showed from moving away from Cuba. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have done."" The final way the author creates a mood is during the last sentence of the memoir. The author states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote captures the mood of being thankful for the unity of his family. He looks up to his parents for making his life as great as it is today. These are some moods the author creates throughout the memoir."	3	3		3

4533	5	The author of this memoir presented a kind of grateful and cheerful mood. I believe it is this type of mood because in the memoir he talks so much about on how that he is so grateful that his parents were so caring and selfless people because they moved from their home country cuba just for the sake of their children. He presents the cheerful mood by focusing all the good things in his life with his parents in his house and neighborhood. Example's are him talking about how all the cultures got along good with one another in his area. He also talked about the good times he had with his parents in the kitchen. The memoir he left was definetly a pausitive one not a negative one.	2	3		3

This shows that the whole house was filled with love because of Narciso's parents. Also,the way Narciso talks about his parents shows that he lovef his parents. This also showed happiness because since he would never forget his home in must've been nice there.

4540	5	"The mood of this memoir is almost remorseful, remembering his childhood home, his family life that includes his neighbors and extended family Narciso Rodriguez creates a feeling of being home and being surrounded by people you love. He explains how his first friend was his babysitter and the person who lived above him. And his real grandparents were still in Cuba so his downstairs neighbors became his surrogate grandparents. He also creates a mood of having no where to turn when it came to his parents getting jobs in the United States. They had to settle with getting jobs underequiped for their abilitie. His parents, he said ""came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give the children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved"". He feels that this is one of the reasons his childhood house was turned into a home."	2	3		3																					
4541	5	"The mood that the author was trying to create was a sense of hope, family and happiness. Hope was @CAPS1 because his family helped others by letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on there feet which provided hope for the extended family. Family was @CAPS1 be cause in the last paragraph he is explaining how in this tiny apartment you learned the definition of ""family"" through welcoming refugees and celebrating his first birthdays and having a loving, careing enviroment. Finally I think happiness was @CAPS1 because he was explaining how grateful he was for his parents coming to america to give him a better life and also in paragraph two he was explaining how his home environment was filled with cooking and music which can be factors of happiness. These are some moods that the author was trying to show."	2	2		2																					
4542	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" (who is also the author) is writing about his live changing experience. The mood of the poem is happy. His parents immagrated from Cuba to the United States in 1956. When he was growing up he learned all Cuban traditions and envied them all. He's very proud of his parents for the risk that they took for him. This is why the mood of the story is happy."	2	2		2																					
4543	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, several moods such as comfort, sympathy and a sense of family are created by the author. Immediately as I began to read I felt comforted by the author writing about the home and family. I felt especially warm inside when he talked of his fond memories with friends. As the author continues, you cannot help developing a sense of security. However, once you continue reading and get into @CAPS1 @NUM1, the mood darkens. The author talks about the hardship his parents had to endure to give him a better life. I solemnly read on and was filled with a sense of family. ""I'll always be grateful to my parents,"" the author writes. ""for their love and sacrifice."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2). He explains how much he appreciates the love and care given to him by his family.

4544	5	The author creates a happy and grateful mood in the memoir. Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home. In our neigborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celabrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was where I learned the real definition of family. I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home	2	2		2																					
4545	5	"The feeling in this article when it talks about family is love, peace, happiness, and gratefulness. Narciso understands that his parents left everything in Cuba for him. @CAPS1 could tell that his parents love him very much and @CAPS1 is grateful for that. In paragraph @NUM1 @CAPS1 states, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 has the opportunity to be born in @LOCATION1 and having a better life. Narciso also learned that @CAPS1 could love a non blood relative because they could be his family too. There were many people that were like family to him. @CAPS1 loved them and they were happy spending time with each other. In this memoir the mood would most likely be happy and loving."	2	2		2																					
4546	5	"The mood  created by the author in the memoir shows a kind community, careful, and courage. My first quote is ""...hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.""  The quote means the mood of the community is kind and helping. My second quote is ""My parents always kept their arms and their doors open to the many people we considered family."" This quote means that his parents  mood was careful and do anything for people if they needed help. My third and last quote is ""My mother and father had came to this country with such courage."" This quote means like before they came to the United States they had courage and now they were going to make it and be successful.

""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air,"". The phrases in parenthesis portrait to me a loving mood. Another part of the memoir that really portraits to me a loving mood is the way the author describes this community and his parents sacrifice is shown by these next to quotes ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need"", ""They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially,"". The detail and emotions he uses in those quotes makes the mood a loving mood for  all the author gives a great and loving mood in this memoir."	3	3		3

4583	5	They were sad through some of this memoir. The first reason why they were sad was that they left there familys. They also had to leave the country of Cuba. And left their friends to. They were also happy too. The reason why is because it is a Spanish, Cuban, and @CAPS1 comunity. So they feel like they are at home.    They were made because they would half to start there life over.

It also changed a regular house into a special home for them because they had people over and over and over which finally became family. The neighbors also helped create the mood by not creating any negative action or violence in the author put the family's location in a non-american neighborhood.	2	2		2																					
4585	5	"The mood of the memoir is kind and loving. It showed kindness in paragraph @NUM1, what the memoir described how his parents made the whole house feel sweet and nice. He did this by using words like ""innocence"", ""celebrations"", and ""warm home"" to create a the feel of kindness. Love was shown when the author told about the way his parents welcomed anyone of every race to live with them until they ""got back on their feet."" This shows love because when you are welcomed no matter what the problem is or who you are, it deminstrates love to everyone."	2	3		3																					
4586	5	"When you have a loving family and a beautiful home, you should be very grateful. Narciso Rodriguez was also very grateful. The overall mood of Narciso's story is gratefulness. Narciso Rodriguez was born in 1961 in Newark, New Jersey. His memoir explains how @CAPS1 is grateful for everything. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 would always tell his parents about his admiration for their strength and perseverance.

Another is showing him about his culture threw music, cooking, celebrations and taking care of other people. His parents let people stay at their home when they Need to get on their feet. And by always having people over for dinner (Aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins, @CAPS1 etc...).	1	2		2																					
4588	5	"All these things that I listed all had something to do with creating the @CAPS1 in this  memoir. But the biggest feeling of all is love his parents went all the way from Cuba just to give @CAPS2 a better life, Even if it meant leaving their jobs, family, friends all behind just to give their son a better life. Also after they arrived they lived in a one room apartment for a year then moved to a new house and made it ""our traditional Cuban home"" so it would teach their son about the place where they came from and to make it feel natural for Narciso When he was born. Even after that they were still kind and had open arm for other immagrants. So I absolutly think that the @CAPS1 in this memoir is about an overwhelming feeling of love."	3	2		3																					
4589	5	"The ather creats mood in the memoir in soe ways. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 the author says, ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative.""

4593	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a very happy mood. The author's parents gave up everything to come to @LOCATION1 for their soon to be child. They did that so that he could have a better education and for that he is verry greatful. The author loved his home and had great times in their. It is his most favorite place in the whole world and that is why he talks about his home in great detail. The author had great family memories in the kitchen with Cuban music and the scent of Cuban food. The author's mood is gratefull. It is because for what his parents did for him by moving to Cuba. It also is happy because of all the great times he had there. The author would probably want to relive those times as I want to relive  times of my childhood.	3	3		2																					
4594	5	"The mood created by the author is that he is remembering back at the old days how he used to live and how much he admires his family but mostly his parents.

4596	5	The mood created by the author is that @PERSON1 is grateful For what he has. @PERSON1 is grateful for his parents arriving In @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 likes to cook Cuban food and listen to Cuban music.

4597	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir would be grateful and happy. It really makes you wanna think about life and how good it is, thanks to parents and grandparent, even anchestors. It makes you want to love your parents even more seeing how they went through alot and probably gave up alot for you. Like leaving their homeland or giving up great things like @ORGANIZATION1 and Narciso Rodriguez Sr did for their family or son. They wanted a better life and education for their kids. They had to leave their homeland, where they were born and raised and give up some things to get better things. They had to give up their job and skill's they already knew how to do for better things. The good thing that happened or that they get is more freedom and better life and education, it's not easy leaving everything you love and where you are born but has to be done for better things and opportunities. Reading this memoir gives you or leaves you with a satisfying, grateful, happy and kinda sad mood.	3	3		3

4604	5	"This excerpt called ""Narciso Rodriguez"" written by Narciso Rodriguez, he sets a light, happy mood. I say this because throughout the whole story, he is describing all the good things about his parents and his household during his childhood. A few examples are in paragraph @NUM1, where Rodriguez states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family"". When he says this, it gives the reader a good feel of how his parents cared for anyone who needed their help. In paragraph @NUM2, Rodriguez says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he says this, it is another time he is telling us he is grateful for his family.

An example of this was ""passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air."" This supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because culture music came from the author's memories, which is the mood. Another way the mood was created by the author in the memoir was by the author's opinions of the memories. An example of this was in paragraph @NUM1 ""(and for which I am eternally grateful)."" This supports the idea that the mood was created by the author in the memoir because the author expressed their opinions in there own way which set the mood."	2	2		2

The satisfaction part is in there too when they are satisfiyed with what they got like, a job, a home, family, friends, and they are makeing money.

Narciso says, ""I will never forget that house or its gracious neighbors, or the many things I learned there about how to love' (@NUM3). To sum it all up, the mood Narciso Rodriguez created for his memoir is gratitude."	3	3		3																					
4612	5	"The mood created by the author in this... memoir would be thankfulness and appreciation. I think @PERSON1, wrote this memoir for his parents. He wanted to portrey that even though most people would think that he had a tough life, he would completely disagree. He reailzes that his parents did what they did so @PERSON1 would have a better life. He appreciated the fact that his parents always made anyone feel like they were part of the family. They were loving, caring, heartwarming people. Like @PERSON1 said, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	2	2		2																					
4613	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood is very grateful. All throughout the story, the other kept stating that he is extremely grateful to his parents for their selflessness and care. This mood shows most in paragraph @NUM1 because he continually thanks his parents for moving to the United States from Cuba to help him when he is born. He thanks them for leaving their friends, family and jobs to help him, even if the new jobs they get are not what they deserve.So, as you can see, the author is very grateful to his parents, making this the mood."	2	1		2

I think this @CAPS1 his parents ""unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful.)"" This shows that he appreciates his parents passing on their cooking skills. Another example when Narciso is thankful ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 they gave up their jobs of working in a laboratory and chemical engineering to make his life better. This shows that the speaker was creating a tone of gratefulness"	2	2		2																					
4616	5	"In the memoir in ""@PERSON1 Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1, the overall mood of the storie is happy.The reason its happy is if you hear the tone how shes telling us. ""I was born into a simple house situated in a two-family, blonde brinck building in the *** section of Newark, New jersy. My young parents created our traditional Cuban home."" @CAPS1 sounds happy to be Cuban it what @CAPS1 is. thats what the mood of the memoir.Another reason it's happy is ""I learned the real defenition of family And for this I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood. @CAPS1 cares about his familey @CAPS1 now feel what his parents showed him thats why the overall mood is happy.In the memoir ""@PERSON1 Rodriguez"" by @PERSON1 the overall mood of the memoir is happy."	2	2		2																					
4617	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir feels like that of simplicity and home. He talks of the music and smells of his house, giving the feel that one is actually there sensing everything. He describes his home in such a relaxed way, and how the people in his neighborhood were also good to eachother. It gives the empression that his life was like a relaxed dream where everything is right. He talks of all his relatives that live nearby, and being a child I feel a somewhat comforted sensation from that very part. He describes how his parents had been working in Cuba with great jobs, but had moved for their children to @LOCATION1 where they would have to take lesser paying work. Sacrifices like those make me feel as if there is pure love left in the world, I only wish my parents cared like that. Though this story proves the love of two parents to their children, and that alone makes me feel a sense of peaceful closure.	2	3		3																					
4618	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez the mood is happy. Narciso is happy with his family and his cultre. He is glad that he is with his family. Narciso Rodriguez loves his talent, but he is just a little sad that he won't be able to meet his real grandparents. That is the only thing that he is sad about. Other than that he is as happy as can be.	1	1		1																					
4619	5	The mood in this story is sad because the person leaves cuba and someone in the family dies. But the person has big dreams and becomes a fashion designor	0	1		1																					
4620	5	"In the article Narciso Rodriguez the tone is loving, peaceful and happy. In this memoir it talks about family and friend coming together as one. In the article the best example of happiness and peace is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" This shows joy because they are all together. Another example is in paragraph seven where he says I learned the real definition of family."" This is loving because it shows he is happy and he enjoys being with friends and family. Another reason why the tone is grateful is because he says ""... there is no way I can express my gratitude..."" this is happy because he is thankful for what everyone does in conclusion the tone is happy, loving and grateful"	3	3		3																					
4621	5	"I think the memoir is a thankful and grateful mood. The author is grateful that she has parents that moved to @LOCATION1 for her. Also she is grateful that the simple place she lives in feels like a home. This says so in the last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" Also Narciso is thankful in paragraph @NUM1 ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly as many imagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS1 how thankfull Narciso seems to her parents who sacrificed their whole life for her. If that was me writing that story I would make the mood very grateful towards my parents."	3	2		3																					
4622	5	The mood of the memoir I believe to be grateful or enspioring. Narciso's parents are imigrants from Cuba who live in a rasict community and are working to be able to support there kids. They are great parents to Narciso and provide him with basic nacessidies. They feed him, and buy him clothes. Narciso is very kind and thankful for the trouble his mother and father go through and he is also very considerate to try to help them when they need it. The mood is grateful because that is how Narciso feels toworrds his parents.	2	1		2																					
4623	5	"Throughout this memoir the mood was very realistic. While I was reading it I was very interested in what Narciso had to say next. It seemed as if he was extremely happy to be at where he's @CAPS1. From his speech in this story I can tell that his personality is very outgoing and he likes to look back at where he used to be, and where he is now, and all the sacrifices that have been made throughout his lifetime. He is a very grateful child. Another mood in the story was happiness, along with unity. Naciso quotes ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" Just by reading this quote you can clearly see that Narciso is very grateful. He also quotes ""But, In reality There is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important my friends and family are to me."" @CAPS2 reader, there you have it. Those are the two main quotes throughout this memoir explaining the mood of the set!"	3	3		3																					
4624	5	"The author of the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, talks a lot about home and how you can find family were your not expecting too.He sets the mood in the memoir, that portrays love, warmth, and happyness. The overall mood of the memoir is loveing. Like how Narciso says in paragraph @NUM1, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about love.""When Narciso was growing up he learned that ""... Family had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" All the cultures in his neighborhood came together in unity and Friendship. So Narciso Rodriguez wants to create a warm, loving, @CAPS1 mood to his memoir, just like he experienced growing up!"	2	3		3																					
4625	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is greatfulness. The memoir showed how greatful Narciso's was to his parents. Their bravery and selflessness must have truley impacted his life then and probaly how he lives today. It also give the feeling of respect. In this memoir it shows how much he truley respected his parents and community. And last I think it gives the mood of admiration. The memoir really expressed how much he admired his parents and community. It showed how much he admired his parents bravery and he admired his overcoming of odds. He also admired how a community of different races could get over that and pull toghether to really make a community.Those are some of the moods that ar expressed in this memoir.	2	2		2

4628	5	"The author sets a mood to the memoir that allows the reader to attach and relate to what he is trying to explain. The mood given off by the memoir to me is selflessness. We all have an experience in life where someone gives up a piece of their lives for you. And Narciso's case his parents ""moved from Cuba to give him a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers and the country they love."" Even though they gave these things up they brought along a lot of their Cuban customs with them such as music, cooking and lifestyle for Narciso to experience while living in the safe and comfortable environment of @LOCATION1. They took those things and invited them to their new house to create a comfortable, suitable, loving living area which allowed Narciso to call this area ""home"". By showing the selflessness of his parents the author is able to create a connection to a time in the readers life where someone showed this sort of mood towards them creating a perfect mood to enjoy the reading."	2	3		3																					
4629	5	"The author's mood in this memoir is gratefulness, happiness, and gratitude. In paragraph @NUM1, the author shows happiness, ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.""

Lastly, in paragraph @NUM3, the author tells direct explanation to why he's grateful.

In the memoir the author is saying ""passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" That was the mood of relaxing because when you hear music it relaxes you and when you smell something out of the kitchen that you like it relaxes you even more. Also in the memoir it says most of the people in the neighborhood was spanish, cuban, and Italian immigrants which were honest, hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people. That was showing the calmness because if you know everyone of your neighbors are the same you dont have anything to worry about. The last mood is being happy thing that showed that is he was grateful for his parents. In the memoir the author says he is grateful fo his parents love, sacrifice, and courageous. An their admiration for their strength and perseverance. That was the mood created by the author in this memoir."	3	3		3

4633	5	"In the excerpt, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Narciso Rodriguez's Home: The @CAPS1 print of our Lives, the author creates a very warm, kind of theme by painting a picture in the reader's mind of a family long ago, that lived in unity and supported each other, pulling through in the very end. The author mentions several things from which one can infer the sensation of a strong supportive family that has everything it needs. As the author tells us, ""In 1961� @NUM1 � family, blond � brick building� created our traditional Cuban home� very heart� kitchen� rich culinary skills and a love of cooking� Passionate cuban music filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen� innocence of childhood, congregation of family and friends� endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home"" (� @NUM1). This quote comes across with not just @CAPS2 meaning, but with a feeling that's hard to obtain � like when you're sitting around a campfire with friends and/or family. This feeling is created by the author's language, displaying a masterpiece to the reader. Language like ""very heart"" and ""warm house"" is what really conveys it. In conclusion, the author uses language appealing to a readers sense of safety, warmth, and unity to create a warm theme in his memoir."	2	3		3

First of all, the author talks about the Cuban family he was raised into in Newark, @LOCATION2. He tells the reader that he lived in a two-family home with Cuban immigrants.

4639	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happy because he was always gratefull for everything his parents had done for him (Narciso Rodriguez). My opinion-I think that Narciso Rodriguez had told us students and adults a little bit of his life because he might want people to understand what he had went through in his life, and see how he got this way and how he got to Where he is today or now.	1	1		1																					
4640	5	The mood created by @ORGANIZATION1 in the memoir was a peaceful, loving mood. Narciso says that his @NUM1 room home usually had someon staying there temporarily until they could get back on their feet. In Narciso's neighborhood despite customs, all cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.	2	1		2																					
4641	5	"The mood in the memoir was that the author was grateful. He was grateful for many things like love for  cooking and grateful for his parents. He is happy he has this family and he is happy that he has the simple house he was born in. There are a few choices the mood could be The one that the author has written about is happiness. He grew up where he had friends or family to have someone that they trust. He also had his land lord and first friend that helped grace their kitchen table for meals. His parents opened the door for family members, knowing that others would do the same. He thinks his parents are brave that they would have  courage to come to @LOCATION1, knowing that they would leave everything behind. He is most happy about how he learned about the real meaning of ""family""."	2	3		3																					
4642	5	The author creates an optimistic, caring mood in his memoir. He described the strong sence of love and kenship in hs home. These emotions came out in the writing. The passage-being about his home-sent out a very homey vibe. One can feel the warmth, love, and roots in this memoir. The loving mood of this excerpt has many subdivisions of emotions.	1	2		2																					
4643	5	"Home is where the heart is, and nothing says that more than in the memoir Home: The Blueprints of My life. In the memoir, it talks about family and that where ever your heart is, is where your home is. The memior and gives a tingling and loving mood. It makes us feel happy and feel loving, especially in a few sections.First, when the author talked about what his familly did at home, it made theworld slow down and think about the family. Narcisoc (the author and narrator) said in paragraph two, ""endless celebrations and that encompassed both, formed the back drop to our life in our warm home"". This made a picture of a happy and laughing family like in the movies about the holidays.Second, Narciso said how united they all were. This painted a mood of unity and care. In paragraph four @PERSON1 recalled, ""My parents always kept thier arms and thier door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". The makes the reader think of friendship and hope in trouble times.The mood that came was loving and that tingling feeling of hope. Most people can't find that feeling anymore, especially in these tough times. What most people do know is that and home is not a building, it's a santurary."	3	2		3																					
4644	5	The mood of the author i think is caring; but then I also think it's calm. I think it is caring because of the way he talks about the neighbor-hood. I also think it's caring because he understood what was going on. But I think it is calm because the way the way that he speaks it's in a calm tone.	2	2		2																					
4645	5	The mood created by the @CAPS1 is a very good and happy mood. You can tell by how he is always talk about both happy, family, and his cuba harrtage and works, music.	1	1		1																					
4646	5	"The author creates a peaceful mood in the memoir. Its peaceful because you can just picture the admiration in his voice when he talks about his family. One reason he loves his family is because, ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same."" This means that their family always watched out for one another and protected everyone when they needed help. Another reason he loves his family, his parents specifically, is because they did so much for the author. ""They came selflessly to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they love."" This means that even though everything they have known is in Cuba, they wanted their children to have better lives and chances to be happy, so they left everything and moved on. These are some examples as to why the author has set a peaceful mood in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4647	5	In the excerpt, the author creates a loving mood. It mentions that Narciso will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrafice. That's telling us they get along well and really care for eachother. And then there is his siblings that live in different parts of the apartment. They help set the table and eat with them so I can tell they are all really loving and caring and all enjoy being a family together. This why I believe the author is creating a loving, and peaceful mood.	2	2		2																					
4648	5	"In  ""Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1 the author creates a mood. I think this is the mood of exceptance. @PERSON2 talks about how he grew up in a neighborhood with many other immigrants. Paragraph @NUM1 says ""It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees celebrate their arrival to this country""... This shows that no matter how diverse people were. the author's family always accepted them and their differences. Paragraph @NUM2 says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, and knowing they would do the same for us."" This is another example of how loves and accepting the home that Rodriguez grew up in. It also shows how close, kind, and loving this community was in ""@PERSON2"" from Home: The Blueprints of Our Lives by @PERSON1."	2	3		3																					
4649	5	"In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez from home: the blueprints of our lives,"" written by Narciso Rodriguez @CAPS1 ponders, and re-memmorates past events about his parents home in Newark, New Jersey. The author creates a suttle, but happy memory in the passage.                                                                                                                            The first reason to why the mood is a suttle, but happy one would be because their are serious parts of the passage, and happy parts of the passage. In paragraph four Narciso recalls having a lot of his family members living near his familys his house. When @CAPS1 says, ""Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regulary joined us at our table."" @CAPS1 refers to the supper table when @CAPS1 says, ""our table."" The mood gets suttle when @CAPS2 talks about being greatfull to his parents for coming to @CAPS3 as immigrants with no working knoledge of @CAPS4 language, or writing. @CAPS1 also says in paragraph five, ""to give their children a better life."" @CAPS5 these are many terrific details to explain the mood that Narciso is trying to put into this passage."	3	3		3																					
4650	5	"I think the mood that this author is creating is love, happiness, and respect. He really admired and cared for his parents. In @CAPS1 @NUM1, the author remembers, ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came here selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS2 of the mood is that they took their cuban styles and culture, and brought it to @LOCATION1, living in a simple house. Determination also plays a big @CAPS2. The author's parents were determined to have their kid have a better life. Mood is the overall @CAPS3 in the story, so I think it would be a mixture of happiness, unity, caring, and determination."	2	3		3																					
4651	5	"The mood the author creates inthe memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso @CAPS1 from Home: The BluePrints Of Our Lives, is @CAPS2 but happy and loving at the same time. Narciso creates a @CAPS2 mood because he explains about his familys troubles and his friends and local neighbors. Narcisco explains what they went through, Which makes a person feel @CAPS4. Narciso also creates a happy and loving mood because he would say, People came from all over ""Made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants"" would come to this one city, they would unite and help one another. They would also consider each other one big family, which consists of happy and loving. Those are the moods the author, Narciso Rodriguez, creates in the memoir."	3	2		3																					
4652	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir was really grateful and that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative (paragraph @NUM1).

4727	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is peaceful and loving. Narciso really believes that the definition of home is relationships & love rather than furniture and expenses. His home sounds really great because the way it is described in the memoir, you can see that his family are very caring and selfless people. The fact that his parents take in strangers and allow them to stay at their home really shows that they are very caring people.	2	2		2																					
4728	5	"The author's mood is very grateful and happy. The author's parents were originally from Cuba, and arrived in the United States in 1956. The author moved into a modest, three- room apartment. Both the author's parents had rich culinary skills and a love for cooking. The author inherited his/her skills from his/her parents. They lived in a community of hard-working immigrants from @LOCATION2, Cuba, and @LOCATION3. The author's parents were very nice and friendly.

How it's not just someone your blood related to, but who you care about and love.	2	2		2																					
4730	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir. Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing the memoir life was hard. Quite the contrary our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt recism. in their neighborhood despite customs elsewhere all of these cultures came together in great solidary and friendship. Over all these was hard for the author memoir	2	0		1																					
4731	5	In the memoir the author made a certain mood. The mood he made was loving and very alive. He constructed the mood of love in paragraph @NUM1 where he talks about the memories of his house always filled with comforting aroma of food and the passionate cuban music playing.  It also where he talks about how the memory of his home having the congregation of family and friends as the back drop of their warm home. Another example of the mood of love is in paragraph @NUM2 where he talks about how he was always surrounded by love ones during meals. He constructed mood of life in paragraph @NUM2 as well because he talks of how his house always became a sanctuary to his extended family member who lived with them until they got back on their feet. This gives the mood a sense of life because of all the people who have lived there. In conclusion this is the mood created by the author Narciso Rodriguez in his memoir.	3	3		3																					
4732	5	"Narciso Rodriguez creates many moods in his memoir. In him memoir Narciso states ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" From this statement I feel the mood is loving and kindness.     He also states ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and demonstration of how important family and friends are."" This changes the mood to greatfulness and selflessness of the parents. The last statement I thought really changed the mood was ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood when the author says that is I think thankfulness. Those are so examples of how @PERSON1 changed the mood thought out him memoir."	3	3		3

Also in paragraph @NUM2 ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family knowing that they would do the same for us."" This puts a smile to my face that people are so giving to others when they don't have to, I hope it brings a smile to you to. Last in paragraph @NUM3 ""filled the air with not just sent and music but life and love."" when I read this I think of nothing bad jut a family singing, laughing and all by a warm cozy fire place.

They finally afforded to move into a three-room apartment. She finally called it a home (as she says in the article). She is very thankful for he family and important friends.

4740	5	In this passage the mood to me is like relaxing and a soothing gratefulness towards his parents. The tone of his voice is not angry, not happy happy but soothing. Obviously Narciso loves his family and loves @LOCATION1. By the tone of the narrators voice shows that. Coming to @CAPS1 was a great change as he said because you leave behind so many friends, family and the presence of the culture. Family to Narciso is his relatives but culture as well. As you can see the tone of the narrators voice really makes the story interesting.	2	2		2

His parents made their home a happy place to be, even though they were going through times of rasism and segregation. Also because of his parents positive attitude, it made him a positive person. Another reason the mood was heart-warming was now Narciso's parents demonstrated with their lives and teachings how important family and friends are.

At this time racism, and segregation prevailed in the United States. Despite customs elsewhere, all the cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship.                                                                                                                                      It was a closeknit community of hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people who were not necessarily their own kind, but were clearly in need of a helping hand.

The heart of the house was the kitchen. Where they played Cuban music all the time. The part of New Jersey were the Rodriguez family lived was filled with Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants.

(@CAPS2 in the beginning paragraph @NUM1) That quote sets a mood where a little audience in your head goes ""@CAPS3 I never thought of that way before.""

I think that it is happyness, because no matter what happens, Rodriguez is always gratfull. She does not care if she lives in a simple house with a bunch of people, she is happy that she has a home. In paragraph @NUM1, she says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" I would have looked up to her, for being this gratfull and happy for what she has. Also, the last sentence she says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" These are a perfect example of the mood, greatfullness, and some of happyness."	2	2		2																					
4806	5	"The mood created by the author was structured around many things. First of all, it is a light, warm, happy mood as the author describes how he grew up in a simple but loving neighborhood. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" It continues to be a friendly, cheerful mood throughout the whole memoir. It grows grateful and thankful, however, as the author describes how ""They [his parents] came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even if it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" @CAPS1 he sets a mood which fluctuates and changes throughout the memoir.

4809	5	"I think the mood that the author created was a happy mood and a mood that makes you appreciate what you have. And to always remember where you came from, and to always love family. At some points in the memoir the mood become more about @CAPS1, for example in ""paragraph @NUM1"" he tells how his neighborhood growing up was made up of many races including Spanish, Cuban, and Italian, and he tells how they all came together in solidarity and friendship.

4810	5	"In this memoir, the author created a proud and glad mood.The author, Narciso Rodriguez, showed how proud he was of his family and home through his memoir. His parents left their home in order to make a better life for him and for that he is extremely proud and grateful. His parents also allowed other immigrants to stay with them temporarily. In paragraph @NUM1 he says, ""what They did was a much more courageous thing then I could have ever done.""Narciso shows how glad he was that he got to grow up where he did. He had his parents, as well as all of his neighbors, which he considered his family. Though his apartment wasn't the nicest place to live, it was his home. He was happy there and always had people around him who loved and cared for him. In paragraph @NUM2 he says, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.Narciso shows his proud and glad feelings through his memoir."	3	3		3																					
4811	5	The mood of the author is @CAPS1 and grateful because his parents left Cuba and were very nice people. They let people live at there house. When the didnt have much money, the took any job the could get so they could care there son, Narciso, they had a three bedroom apartment and they let refugees celebrate their arrival to this country, they also had there house full of love and life. Also they came to this country with not knowing how to speak this language. So the mood of this story at the author seems to be proud.	2	2		2																					
4812	5	I think the mood of the memoir is comforting and happy because it talks about how a simple house became a home. The memoir shows how a family can turn a random house into a home would love and by selflessly letting people stay with them until they can get back on their feet. The memoir also shows how family has nothing to do with being blood relaited, it's about being their for one another in a time of need. I think that shows a great amount of comfort and happiness, knowing that a simple apartment could become a loveing home, filled with family and love.	2	2		2																					
4813	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is greatful. For example, his parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to him their rich Culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today (and for which @CAPS2 is eternally greatful. That @CAPS1 that @CAPS2 loves to follow his parents goals and @CAPS2 loves them very much. In addition, @CAPS2 will always be greatful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2 has often told them how courageous they are for letting people into their home. @CAPS2 loves them for their strength and perseverance, and @CAPS2 has thanked them repeatedly. But in reality there is no way to express his gratitude for the spirit of generosity and pressed upon him as such an early age, and how @CAPS2 knows how important family and friends are.	3	2		3																					
4814	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" is greatfulness.Throughout the memoir, the mood created is greatfulness. There are many quotes in the memoir that support the mood created.

4815	5	The mood would probably be happy and sort of sad at the same time because on one hand he's describing his family's happyness and unity amongst his family and Spanish and Italian family's around the area but also segregation in @LOCATION1.	1	1		1																					
4816	5	The mood created by the author is a good @CAPS1 mood it describes His and His familys struggles but very @CAPS1 @CAPS3 even thow they @CAPS4 behind jobs, Friends and Family there all very @CAPS5 and @CAPS1 to enjoy there Lives in New Jersey withe there Cuban setting	2	1		2																					
4817	5	The mood in this memoir is happyness, love, and warmth. It is to be thankful for what you have and not what you want to have. Narciso was just happy to have such a loving family. Inside of Narciso's home it is very happy loving and warm. I think that the author is trying to make it seem like nothing matters as long as you have family. Overall the mood created by the author in the story is love.	1	2		2																					
4818	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is nice and happy. I think the mood is nice and happy because @ORGANIZATION2 shows @CAPS1 for his parents, grandparents, and his house. Another reason I think the mood is happy and nice is because the passage talks about @ORGANIZATION2's hometown, culture, and etc. It also talks about what he is grateful for and that would be his parents, and passionate Cuban music. In conclusion that is what I think the mood is which is nice and happy in the story Narciso Rodriguez.	2	1		2																					
4819	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir. The character Narciso's parent moved from cuba to the united states to have better oppertunitys in life. When @PERSON1 came to america he had became friends with a girl name  Alegria.	0	1		1																					
4820	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a sense of family. He says how when his parents came up to Newark, New Jersey, from Cuba, they had to start all over and find a new beginning. They passed on their rich culinary skills and love for Cuban food in the kitchen of a three-room apartment in a two family building. He says that the community was all a different race but they all became a big family that got through the racist times of the United States in the '@NUM1. He says that he will always be grateful to his parents for their extreme love and sacrifice. He reminds them constantly about how grateful he is and that he can't believe how they did it. So the mood in this memoir is about family.	2	2		2																					
4821	5	"In this memoir the mood varies. In paragraphs three and four it was a ""giving"" mood, for example explained in paragraph four ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing they would do the same for us."" It shows right in the sentence that they gave people in need what they needed in difficult times. In paragraphs six and seven the mood was thankful and happy for the sacrifice his parents gave for him. Because of her future.

4824	5	"In the memoir of Narciso Rodriguez, he gives a mood throughout it. I think that if is that home is really where the heart lies and blooms. Paragraph two states, ""the congregation of family and friends... formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.' In paragraph seven, 'It was in this simple house my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country.' Rodriguez wrapped it all up with what really showed what the mood was, 'I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home,' in paragraph seven."	2	2		2																					
4825	5	"In ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home; the @CAPS1 of Our Lives"" @CAPS2 Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a warm, pleasant mood. He does this in several ways, one being him writing about how the overcome segregation. He says that ""...Our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian imigrants... In our neighborhood,...all of these cultures came together in great solidary and friendship."" In this manner, he creates a bright feeling @CAPS2 saying that even when segregation was dominant, everyone in his community was friends. Another way he mixed the story pleasant sounding is how he talks about his parents. Althroughout the excerpt he, talks how greatful he is to his parent: mainly @CAPS3 of how kind and loving they were As he puts it, ""They came selflessly... to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" @CAPS2 giving up their lives, they were able to make others' lives better. Due to this, he is greatful for the love and support his parents offer to him @CAPS3 of the uplifting theme of the story, Narciso Rodriguez creates a smooth, pleasant, warm, and loving tone."	2	4		3																					
4826	5	The mood created by the @CAPS1 indacates how family and happiness is the best thing, and how A home is were you feel safe and happy, not just for space, but safeness, Narciso made his home a good place for him and his family. He hade a place to call home.	1	1		1																					
4827	5	The mood that the author creates is that his culture is very enthusiastic, and that his home is where he made it. And that his parents were very generous and selfless and that he is eternally grateful for that.	1	1		1																					
4828	5	The mood that was created by the author in the memoir is thankful and @CAPS1. I think that the moods are @CAPS1 and thankful because there are surten parts in the story where it makes him seem like he is @CAPS1 and throughout the story he is just saying thank you to his mother and father. So those are the two moods that I think there are in the memoir. Also these are my thoughts on the memoir.	1	1		1

4899	5	"Home The Blueprints of our Lives is a warm tribute to the parents of Narciso Rodriguez. The author of this memoir had said, ""Growing up in this environment istilled in me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Narciso Rodriguez would change the way a reader would perceive this memoir. It would be a story of a young child who has perceived the physical and mental qualities of adults. @CAPS1 acknowledges the troubles @CAPS1 and his parents are in. For his neighborhood including his family being immigrants, in a time of racism and segregation, @CAPS1 learned how to appreciate this ""close-knit community of honest, hard-working immigrants.""@CAPS1 understood how to Narciso Rodriguez Sr, and @ORGANIZATION2 struggled personally and financially. @CAPS1 became grateful for his opportunity to live in this Cuban home of Newark, New Jersey. Though his parents had worked in a laboratory and studied chemical engineering, they struggle to find work in financial times. @CAPS1 adores them. The author writes, ""They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life."" Without these relationships, and the lives of various people, this memoir would be a selfish story of a child. @CAPS1 appreciates everything the family has done. There was too much generosity impressed upon a boy of such an early age. @CAPS1 had learned how to respect his parents. In the end, Narciso Rodriguez would write a memoir devoted to the bonds @CAPS1 created with his parents and the refugees amongst them."	4	3		3																					
4900	5	"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author."	3	3		3

Another thing that sets a good mood is a talk about how Narciso's parents are always upbeat and ready for any thing.

One example of this is when he says, ""(and for which I am an enternally grateful)"" this shows that he is incredible thankful to his parents for everything they have done for him.

The story says that he was incredibly greatful to have parents that gave him so much love and sacrafice. The mood in the story is deffinetly a very happy one.	2	1		2																					
4927	5	I think the @CAPS1 was happy. I think he was because he has a nice house and a nice family. Another reason why I think he was happy is because he is now in @LOCATION1 but still around his Cuban culture. His parents put him in @LOCATION1 I think because they wanted to live there and start a family. That is why I think that this is the mood of the @CAPS1 in this memoir.	1	2		1

4954	5	In the article Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood in this story is very happy, and heart warming. When she talks about how they have their own cultures, and live in the kitchen, and how the sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and wishing you were there. The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you. It makes the mood happy.	3	2		3

5040	5	"The mood of this memoir is nonfiction. The mood is that because Narciso Rodriguez is telling about his past in his and it is about the life he once lived in New Jersey, in a Cuban, Italian, and a Spanish neighborhood. The house was transformed into a home by his parents, his surrogate grandparents, and himself. The home he lived in was a blonde-bricked apartment, filled with Cuban Aromas and Cuban musics. The mood became joyful because of the Family's love of Cuban Music, and Cuban cooking, (which is really good). The mood also is represented with the Family, a loving and caring family in a nice apartment building. The mood is non-fiction, joyful, loving, and caring, I know this because the ""home"" is so pleasent to be inside."	2	1		2

5043	5	The author created such a specific mood for this memoir. She @CAPS1 off by telling alittle history of how she came to be in @LOCATION1 but quickly changed it to what her home was like. Narciso emphisized the importance of her culture but more importantly her family and friends. she talked about how the latin music, the big cuban cooking all made what is her home. She focuses more on the gratitude of her parents even more than her heritage and family bonds. She's focused on how her parents made a house a home.	2	2		2
