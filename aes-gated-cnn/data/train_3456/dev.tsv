9	3	The essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� describes a man�s bicycle ride through California. Now, California is very hot during the summer, which is when the cyclist is riding. This setting greatly affects the man�s journey. It made it very difficult for him to finish his ride. He drank most of his water in the beginning of his ride so he gets very dehydrated. The text states, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� As you can see the setting makes this man�s bikeride very hard.	2	2		2																					
11	3	The setting of the authors � shortcut� effected his performance and strength tremendously . whether it was the hills, heat or barren landscape all three took their toll on Joe Kurmaskie. Not only that, but his lack of water depleted his energy as well.� Flat road was repalced by short rolling hills.� The hills were a tough thing to pass since Joe was being drained of energy. He overcame this exhaustion when a building came into views.� I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage, and tried not to get too excited with what I believed was my last burst of energy. I manouvered down the hill.� The authour overcame all the problems ne faced even though it was difficult. He seems to have written this piece to exaggrate how important it is to keep going when you want to give up. Winston churchill once said, � success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage it takes to continues that counts.� I believe that @PERSON2 agrees.	3	2		3																					
12	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist very much so! The cyclist is riding through the hot desert. Meaning he needs lots of cold water to keep him hydrated. The longer he rides in the hot sun, the more he sweats, the more likely he will get dehydrated. If he was riding in the rain or snow it could possibly slow him down also, because he would be cold and his muscles might get stiff and not be able to move as fast. This is why the setting affects the cyclist very much so. 	1	1		1																					
15	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road Ahead:Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� by Joe kurmaksie,greatly affect the cyclist and put him through many hardships that he probably could have avoided.The old cotagers told him about a path they thought was right,but was hard and did not get him to the right place.The features of the setting are described as �flat road was replaced by short rolling hills.�	1	1		1																					
17	3	Many different characteristics in a setting and determine the outcome of an event there. Im the story, Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the cyclists journey was affected my a few weather relouded things. The heat was an extreme thing that showed him down and in most cases detened him from reading his maximum level of ability. Also the time of your in which this labes place, greatly affects the cyclist. Lastly, the type of road and amount of ground that he has to cover after affects his performance. Overall, setting can be a determining factor in a journey as they life	2	2		2																					
18	3	The setting of the story affects the cyclist in many ways. Since he is riding in the California desert, he always feels very hot and is always in constant thirst. In addition to this the area he is riding in appears to be quite desolate. He finds nothing but old abondored buildings. He doesn't find anyone. No people or cars, or any sign of modern civilization. This causes him to feel a little unnerved as if something happened to him nobody would know about it. This is especially prevelent when he become dehydrated. In those ways, the cyclist is very much affected by the setting.	2	2		2																					
24	3	An example of the setting affecting the cyclist is when he has the lock of water in a ghost town in just eliterat. He frind the water but e tar like substance come out and it tasted like battery. When he left he had to go through rough road which he couldn�t travel that fast leanes of the condition of the road.	1	1		1																					
31	3	The features of this setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting is a dessert so by common knowledge you know that it is going to be hot and dry. Because it is hot the cyclist needs more water because he is getting dehydrated. And when he is on his low of water because it is dry into mouth gets drys. @CAPS2 because he is in the dessert he sees wild sometime dangerous animals, in the story he sees a ridiculously @CAPS1 diamondbrock snake, which I believe are venomous, @CAPS2 �because � of the extreme heat of the dessert he realizes that he had ??? chance of dropping from heatstroke. @CAPS2 the writer said that the dessert had short rolling hills and rough road ahead ??? would leave worn the cyclist out. Because of this terrain the cyclist way affects.	1	1		1																					
36	3	"The terrain during the cyclist�s journey greatly affects him. For example, the first terrain that he experienced was not very hilly, but rather flat and soothing. The author stated, �I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face.� This shows that he was energized and happy. However, the reader can predict that the journey will not remain this joyful, because the cyclist is basically in the desert during the summer, in which it is extremely hot. Then, the cyclist experiences hilly terrain that sucked the life from his body, especially because he had no water left. The cyclist said, �sometimes life can feel so cruel"", emphasizing that the cyclist mood had changed from enthusiastic to tired and forlorn.  This change of mood from the terrain can be connected to real life, as obstacles are include, in which the person must persevere and be strong to overcome, in which the cyclist finally did. "	3	2		3																					
43	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist alot. The hot sun beating down on him makes him sweat and makes him thirsty. The bumpy roods and hills make him work harder. The abandoned places make him lose hope. If faced with these obstacles I would have been affected in the same way. As I believe any human would be.	1	2		2																					
51	3	The features of the selling effect the cyclist a lot. One factor that would effect the cyclist would be the heat. Also, because of this factor, he�s pobably suffering from lack of water. He�s probably really hot seeing he�s the only one cut in the middle of nowhere for what looks like miles. Another feature of the setting that would probably effect the cyclist is the thought of there @MONTH1 be a car around this next turn. If he can�t see around the next turn he doesn�t know is coming. The cyclist could also be thinking about when the next town will show up.	1	1		1																					
55	3	The features of the setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� affect the main character the cyclist. The cyclist is biking �through the high desert of california in June.� So naturally it can be infereal that it is not and dry, making water a delicacy. As the cyclist is passing through a ghost town and a pump that releases �a tarlike substance followed by brackish water� he is runningout of his precious water. The surrounding landscape of lonely hills tumbleweeds and snakes does not inspire confidence. In fact, the cyclist feels that �l cald drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June.� He finds an old Grape Juice Factory no longer in service causing more anxiousness and dispare l have had an experience similar to this where l wat out walking in a state park in the @DATE1. I was freezing, and a desolate landscape of snow covered trees made me feel at if I�d never be warm again similar to He cyclist who�s environment made him feel hes wald die of dehydration. So, as can be seen. He setting of this short story affects the cyclist.   	3	3		3																					
60	3	The features of the setting effects the cyclist by the way that the auther started talking and how he sound at the beginning of the story. When they both at the picture he looks like hes cecilla ssing and then ceoos. To the story and goo continue ties reads. It doesn�t sound like he is enjoying his ride, because of the niuse he was down on the bumpy roads, sparkes, and the bor of counter tirst he doesn�t have. hes sacting time and sec from add perso doesn�t mic at all because there could hou old �timers and don�t know once thou are tailoring around her, to save, to goo shouldn�t take advice from them because goo could end its line this nidsnes transitin califend doesn�t and how feres how could now do it, to let some or therefore so be dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
65	3	The setting effected the cyclist in a great way. The snakes blocked his pathways, and hi short water supply made it hard to continue. He felt as if he could drop of a heatstroke. His environment, and the information from the old man made his ride very hard to continue. All in all, his settings had a big effect on him.	1	1		1																					
71	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of the setting affected the cyclist. For example, the cyclist traveled miles on a bike dealing with the weather in the deserts, little bit of water, and being tired. The cyclist faced many hard times trying to travel on a bicycle from one point to another.	1	1		1																					
79	3	"The cyclist is traveling through a rough part of California during the hot month of June. The author describes part of part of his journey; ""I was traveling through the high deserts of california in june."" The heat of the sun and not much water around is causing the cyclist to worry about his health. A little further into his journey realizes how bad he could get if he doesn't find water soon. The author write, ""the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke. ""As the cyclist has run out of water & there is no sign of life around, he begins to feel that he @MONTH1 never make it through the desert to yosemite National Park.The author describes this ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean. ""The setting of the cyclist""s journey greatly affected how he percieved his journey."	3	3		3																					
81	3	The setting greatly affects the cyclist because he is the one riding over, �short rolling hills,� and arround a,�ridiculously large snake,� and because its hot he could suffer from heatstroke at any minut. So yes the author is affected by the setting	1	1		1																					
87	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For example, the weather in California in June was hot and the water the cyclist found in the pipes was hot, as well. The text says, �Somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This affected him because he had no water to drink from. Another example is when he had to overcome tumbleweeds and snakes. The text states, �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� This was an obstacle that he had to overcome. Another example is he was deserted. The text says, �no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.�	2	2		2																					
90	3	The setting and it`s features affect the cyclist greatly. He is in the desert and all the town's are abandoned. Also he now hits a sign that says �Rough Road Ahead�(kurmaskie, pg @NUM1). This makes his trip even worse because now he has to make it over not only big hills but torn up, old, beaten roads. And he has the sun beating down and is almost out of water.	2	1		2																					
92	3	The setting and features affect the cyclist because with each building he hopes for water, but since he is traveling through a desert water is in limited supply and many empty buildings are left out in the wastland. These buildings create a feeling of releve in the cyclist anty to be followed by despair to find them abandoned. The land with no features also creates a feeling of lost hope in the rider making his entire ordeal that much harder. Over all it was an excureiatly experience physicly and mentaly for the cyclists.	2	2		2																					
96	3	The features in the setting are not very good for the cyclist. He�s in California in June, and it�s very hot. It�s pretty much a desert. When he stops for water, the pump he finds does not have any more water in it except for a few drops. Also, the few drops that he does get taste like battery acid. So this is not very good for the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
97	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the author changes the mood by not only telling us how the cyclist feels, but also by describing his environment. As he's leaving the �resevoir compground� he�s feeling pretty good because he�s just leaving �the serenity of an early-summer evening and he�s headed toward �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� He�s in a beautiful setting and this affects the cyclist because he�s anticipating another one. However, when he moves to the �ghost town� and the �sun was beginning to beat down� he�s less confident and becoming more doubtful about the mens advice. However, he�s still optimistic, finally it funny that it was once �a thriving little spot.� Next, when the cyclist comes to �one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps and a coral� he knows that things are in bad shape and he @CAPS1 water. However, all the have is a �tarlike substance� so he moves on, having no choice. When he comes to the �rough road tumbleweeds and a ridiculously large snake� it effects the cyclist by letting him know that things are at their worst and he can either give up, or keep pushing through. I doubt it could get any worse, and so does the cyclist. Finally, at the end the cyclists enters a rather modern bathroom� and things are back to civilization for him, so he feels relaxed, relieved and much better. 	3	3		3																					
100	3	The setting in the story affected the cyclist by him going through obstacles to get to town. The setting was in a desert in California in June. The cyclist also had a lack of water and when he found a pump he said it was black and tasted like battery acid. And then he stopped for directions and the men gave him the oldest set of directions. So the cyclist said he would stick to his trusty map.	2	2		2																					
101	3	"In the text, the features of the setting greatly affect the cyclist. For example, the text states, �There was no one in sight, not a building, or structure of any kind.� This made the cyclist very lonely and they started to lose hope of finding water. Secondly, the text stated, ""In an ironic twist the building abandoned years easlier, by the looks of it-had been a Welch�s Grape Juice factory� This made the cyclist lose more hope, after he thought the building would have people in it and he got excited. Lastly, the text states, �GRAPE AND @CAPS1�S FISH CAMP� The sight of this building gave the cyclist hope and happiness for finding a place to get a drink. The setting�s features greatly affect the cyclist's feelings."	2	3		3																					
104	3	Sun, amount of miles, people all are reasons why the setting affects the cyclist. For example, the sun was beating down on him every time and the cyclist seemed to complain that it was so hot. Also, he said that he really didn�t seem to notice it through in his mind it affected the cyclist. Next, the amount of miles that the cyclist was biking affected him mentally because people kept,	1	1		1																					
107	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was a very large factor of the story that was actually the cause of the protagonist�s problem throughout. First it started off with the large hills he had to ride up, making him work harder and tire himself out quickly. Next the big problem was the heat of June, � and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because � The heat was so really bad because it made him hot, thus depleting his water supply [which he needed to survive] and it gave the large, almost inevitable risk of falling from a heatstroke and dying. The heat also made the abandoned Juice Factory all the more ironic and bitter for the protagonist. �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen.� @CAPS1, in the unbearable heat with no water left and @CAPS2 knows how many miles left to cycle, this really made him feel like the sorriest, unluckiest man in the world. The setting overall, seemed almost crafted to make the protagonist not only suffer from the natural elements, but from things that seemed meant purely taunt him for it. 	3	3		3																					
113	3	"The features in the setting of ""Rough Road ahead"" affect the cyclist. First of all, the weather causes most of his problems. Since the cyclist was biking in a california desert in June the temperature had to be in the @NUM1's. This causes him to become dehydrated, which is evident when he states, ""I had been hitting my water bottles quite regularly"" The heat therefore causes the cyclist to drive excessively and run out of water, also, the objects the cyclsit comes across on his journey affect him. For example, while riding on a rough path, ""a ridiculously large snake blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me."" This saves the biker progress and most likely scared him. The cyclsit is greatly affected by the features in the story setting."	2	3		3																					
122	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. In the essay, it states, �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time-say, before the last world war-but on that morning it fit the tradition of a ghost town.� This statement might affect the cyclist in the way that, they fear if they get into any trouble there is no one around to help out. This statement can also mean that they fear that they are going the wrong way. In the essay, it states, �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a coral they couldn�t had in the larger mule greeted me.� This statement simply gives the cyclist the impression that this particular town is juice, and that nobody has even been known to live here in years, @MONTH1 be decades. The different features of the journey of the cyclist in the essay, many would fear the outcome,if they over fear the journey and turned �old timers� who had never left their porches, in order to experience such things.         	1	2		2																					
124	3	The cyclist trusted a man that didn`t know much about the world, he thought that the guy would know how to get to the place he was looking for. The cyclist took his advice, he thought that he would be there really soon so he start to drink his water really fast. He realized that he was out of water and the park he was going to wasen�t anywhere near. The cyclist got frustrated and angry he was now crossing the desert which was making him tiered and dehydrated. He pased this road that was a rough road with tumbleweeds and snakes he kept on going until he sow the �@CAPS1 Juice� company. He hurried there, went into the bathroom drank same water. When he got out an old men asked if he needed directions, the cyclist said no.	2	2		2																					
128	3	The author had to bike through extremely hot weather. This made him feel sweat a lot. The narration states, �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt� (@NUM1). This caused him to drink water until he ran out. The narration states, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips� (@NUM1). He then had to suck on pebbles which he could have choked on. The narration states, �With any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat�(@NUM1).	1	1		1																					
129	3	In the story �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� there were many features of the setting that affected the cyclist. The most challenging problem faced  by the author was the lack of water. � I pumped that handle for several minutes but the water wouldn�t calm down nor I tried a drip or two,it had the flaver of beatterly acid.When @CAPS2 set out for the next train @CAPS2 came to a road that read �Rough road ahead, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit. The tarrain got more bumpy & hard to cross. The effected the determination the cyclist had left @CAPS2 the regreted not listening to the old men of didn�t think they knew what they were talking about. Due to the fact they never left their porches. As you can see the setting most deffinated effected the cyclist in physical or mental ways.	2	2		2																					
135	3	The setting easily can affect the cyclist in many ways. The area in which the cyclist was in the seemed to be abandoned which doesn�t give a well thinking to this person . If a town was abandoned or a road was, automatically then won�t be any noticable building structures for a while. Also, the and and shape of the road seemed to be very dangerous for the cyclist not only because of the narrow and rocky path but because of the wildlife. In the text, it says how a diamond back snake, poisoness was directly infront of the cyclist. That example explains on how the wildlife might exceed to more dangerous creature. Finally, the temperature, whether it was hot or cold he cyclist was limited to water & being completely dehydrated was a huge caution for the cyclist. The conditions of the setting of the setting the cyclist was in became a disadvantage for him.	3	3		3																					
139	3	There are many ways the features of the setting affect the cyclist. One feature is the weather. When a cyclist is on a trip the weather could affect the setting greatly. An example, if it started to rain the roads could become very slippery and dangerous to ride your bike on. The cyclist and his bike could crash and die. Just cause of the weather. Another feature is the animals. An animal is important cause any were you do the are different animals that do different things. If the cyclist knows  the animals around the area that he is traveling he could keep safe and not be harmed. Ti�s better to know the area and feel safe. Then not knowing what�s going to happen next.	1	1		1																					
143	3	The features of the setting greatly  effected the cyclist.  He was  riding along   on a  route he had little confidence would end up anywhere. That being the first time ever being on that rode and having only not of date knowledge about it made the cyclist rework. The temperature was very hot, where was little shade, the   sun was beating down on him. The route was very discouraging .all the cyclist wanted wanted   was water and the route kept touenting him with false hope. At the first town he noticed a water pump, but all he could get of it was sludge and water that tasted like battery acid. Next he came to a deserted old building that approved to be an old bottling factory for Welch�s  grape  juice. The cyclist would appear  to be closing in on something to drink, but be left with nothing.	3	2		3																					
163	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead� the setting greatly affects the cyclists. The @LOCATION1 desert climate burrows down upon the cyclist. For example the was further route, he takes is not only @LOCATION1, but also has no place to get water. The heat and lack of water combine for deadly dehydration upon the cyclists. The setting now forces the cyclist to become more determined if he wants to live. He must continue and pray for a town to come up, so he @MONTH1 restock on water and become hydrated once again.	2	2		2																					
172	3	In the story, Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist faced many obstacles. For example, he had to get directions to Yosemite National Park, but the directions were from elder men, whose information was out of date. In addition, the cyclist had to decide which way to take when there was a fork in the road. He chose a path the old men said would have a town nearly eighteen miles down the road. Furthermore, the cyclist ran into flat roads that went to rolling hills, snakes blocking his path, and a dehydration state that could�ve killed him. In conclusion, this man overcame obstacles to get to Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
177	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in a lot of ways. in the essay, the author describe how the setting is hot, it is bumpy, it makes him sweat, it makes him tired, he is also, running out of water from his thirst. The road gets, very rocky at one point. The narrator states �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills (Kurmaskie @NUM1). There is also a photograph that shows how rough the terrain is. It is barrain with nothing around it.	1	1		1																					
179	3	The settings have a huge affect on the cyclist. When he first comes to the �@CAPS1 town� he isn�t really warried he is kind of laughing and thinks his funny by saying.� This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time  - say, before the last world war.� Then after he says that it ways he chuckled. When he gets the dark in the road with the risky pipe of water he begins to switch into conservation made and begins to get is scared. He says.� I would comer  water- a test at my inner spirit � This showing that he was scared. After he sees the abanoned Grape juice factory he says something like birds are going to pick him clean and leave behind same expensive biking gear. This definatly shows that he is giving up. Another thing that would back this up is when he talks about writing in his diary about the old men who gives him these direction. When he finally reaches the balt shop he is releved and goes to the bathrom and drinks water. He  also says that he will buy bait even though he doesn�t have a rod. These examples show the many ways the setting affected the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
180	3	"In the story, ""Do not exceed posted speed limit, the faetures of the setting effect the cyclist. To keep cool on a hot summer day, is might be neccessary for one to find shade. Just to add to the misfortune of the story. There was no one in eight, not a building, car or structure of any kind."" This factor does not help the cyclist at all, infact, all it does is make the cyclist more  exhausted. Another element in the story that effects the cyclist is the lack of water. Early on in the story the author explains, ""The water bottle contained only a few tatalizing sips."" With more miles to go,the cyclist starts to loose hope of making it to his destination alive. The feature of rolling hills also affects the cyclist. The cyclist is already tired enough, and just to  add to his misfortune, ""flat roads was replaced by short, rolling hills."" @CAPS1 the hills are short, they still could have put impact on him because of the ropolalive hills. Many features of the story effected the mood of the story."	2	3		3																					
182	3	The features of the setting on the way to Yosemite National Park, greatly affected the cyclist. On the way to the park, the cyclist had encountered the heat of the desert in California. Besides the heat the cyclist had to overcome the rough terrain of the of the short, rolling hills. This made the cyclist tired and weary. Adding to his weakness, and the extreme heat, he also ran out of water, causing him to become dehydrated. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heat stroke...laugh.� This trip through the California desert greatly affected the cyclist by causing great exhaustion and dehydration.	2	1		2																					
186	3	The cyclist lost hope because he was in the California desserts in June. The cyclist started to lose hope because there was a rusty water pump that pumped out battery-acid tasting water. When he said the sign �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, was very cautious. The cyclist thought for sure that he was going to die out there. The cyclist also felt lonely because in the text it says, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. The cyclist was in the California desert and that made him think he was going to die out there.	2	2		2																					
187	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" by Joe Kurmaskie, he describes his trying biking trip through California. In the essay, he describes the weather with �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� While this @MONTH1 not directly characterice the weather, the reader can confin a clear image of the sweltering heat of a desert in the summer. When the author comes across the �ghost town� followed by the dilapidated shack, and finally the sign that read �Rough Road Ahead,� his hope of finding Yosemite Park was gone. The hopelessness of the situation made the author want to give up, thinking that he was going to die out in the desert from dehydration and exhaustion. This can be related to anyone that has been lost in unfavorable conditions, and the feeling of helplessness and fear that goes along with it. It feels like everything is against you, with nothing working in your favor, and this is what the author experiences in his description of his trip in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.�"	3	3		3																					
190	3	As the reader listened and followed the directions of the old-timers he faced many issues and also learned a leason. As he began to ride into the day break of morning he had strong legs and even a smile on his face. As time went on he soon became close out of water and a loss of energy. The @CAPS1 summer day made him sweat and began to think that he birds would pluk at his body as if he would die on his ride to Yosemite. When he finally got to a town he soon refreashed and learned that he would and start to began to follow his own way: of getting to places	2	2		2																					
195	3	Some features of the setting setting that affected the cyclist were signs that had speed limits. The sign affected the speed of the cyclist. Another feature was a hill on the route. This affected the cyclist by making him tired because he said �I wipe the sweat from my eyes.�	1	1		1																					
209	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. He was riding his bike across a place with no cars, no people, no water, or no food. It was a dangerous journey for him but he made it.	1	1		1																					
212	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there are no cars, building, water, or people in sight. It goes from flat road to rolling hills. Even though he had no water he was determined to keep pedeling. �Rough road Ahead, do not exceed posted speed limit� At this point he had no water left and he was pretty much in the middle of nowhere. If I was in his situation I would feel hopeless. There was no sign of hope. He just saw endless rolling hills and that was all. Then when he saw the building over the hills he thought he was home free. So he pedeled up to the building, and that with all the others was abandoned. The cyclist thought he was going to die. In conclusion the features of the setting greatly affected the cyclist because seeing nothing gives him no hope. If he had cars and buildings on both sides of him that probably would have give him some confidence but that was not the case. He is in the middle of nowhere. He finally came to bend and say �Then, as easily as randing a bend my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me.�	2	2		2																					
214	3	The features of the setting that the author cyclist through definitely effect not only his mood, but his the physical condition. To start, it is mentioned that he is in �the high deserts California in June,� @CAPS1 it is implied that the weather is hot causing the author to sweat as he bikes along. Next there is a change in terrain an he soon approaches �rolling hills� which are more difficult to bike on. Finally the author sees a sign that reads �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� and becomes discouraged because his bike is not even capable of reaching the speed limit but he still has to manage getting past the rough road. After passing this road he approaches a picture of a boy drinking juice that is posted on a juice factory. Seeing this sign most likely perpetuates his thirst and leaves him more exhausted and frustrated before. Such features of his surroundings played a large part in the author�s change in mood.  	3	3		3																					
220	3	"On that long bike ride the cyclist was affected by the setting. He was affected of the lack water, the heat and the bad directions, throughout the story the cyclist ran out of water due to bad directions from some men.""Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� He ran out of water and became dehydrated through his trip. The heat has a major part of his dehydration during the bike ride.� I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I have been to California and it is hot. The trip was made even longer due to some bad directions from some old men.� Because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� The gentlemen gave him wrong directions because in their time that was right information. But not the land has changed and the directions were wrong. When going on bike rides the setting of the rides is a great help or a bad help. The cyclist experienced how the setting of a bike ride can affect him a great deal."	2	3		3																					
222	3	The cyclist in this essay was a very brave man. He had many obsticles in his journey but he still made it. Nature was most definatly not on his side that day. He had to ride his bike up and down hills several times which wears you out very quickly�. �Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills, �After he got threw the hills, he came to a sigh � ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT�.  Now he has to go through bumply roads. �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamond back-blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me�. Now the poor guy had to deal with snakes bigger than him! Thankfully he got by the snake, alive. �Over one long cripping hill, a building came into view�. The man thinks he found someplace to get water, but its an abonded building . �...,by the looks of it � and been a welch�s grape Juice Factory and botting plant.�.	0	0		0																					
226	3	In the essay �Do not exceed posted spedd limit� by @PERSON1 many features of the setting effect the cyclist. First, when he arrived at the first �town� and said, �this place might have been a thriving little spot at one time � say, before the last world war.� This deserted ghost town setting was like a joke and had a small effect on the cyclist because it was the beginning of the day and he still had a good water supply. Though when he arrived at the ramshackle shed surrounded by several rusty pumps the effect it had wasn�t so mild. He says, �The sight was troubling.� Then when he got on his hands and knees and started working the pump the situation didn�t get much better. All that came out was a drop or two that tasted like battery acid. Lastly, when he arrived at an abandoned welch�s Grape juice factory after several miles. This had a very wearing effect on him since the water supply was low and he had cycled into disappointment after disappointment. This setting in this essay seemed very abandoned and hopeless. It was only determination that got this cyclist through it.	1	1		1																					
227	3	The story �Do not exceed posted speed limit is about a cyclist who got bad direction to Yosemite National Park and has a depleeding water supply is extreme heat. He is doubtful that he will make is journey because he is dehydrated and dizzy.	2	2		2																					
230	3	The features of the setting in, �Rough Road Ahead� affect the cyclist. The cyclist started at a camp ground and conversing with some old dogers, and he asks them how to get to Yosemite, and the tell him a shortcut that turns out to be out of date. On the road to Yosemite he sees nothing except abandoned towns. He is really thirsty and there�s no water anywhere. He thought he was going to die. He said, �I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� It was a hot summer day and there was tumbleweeds and snakes by the road and him feel hotter and more thirsty than he would be if it was cooler and if there was a big river flowing by the road. But it was hot and dry in California and desert-like and it made him feel like he was dying because he was in the middle of nowhere therefore the setting affected the cyclist	3	2		3																					
231	3	This cyclist had the conditions of the land to deal with, He didn�t have too much water with him and there wasn�t a good source anywhere near him that he could see. He just had to keep going. He also talked about how the road was rough. This was conflicting on how long it took him to get to the next place with water. More over he was in a desert area. The air was dry and hot, the heat was making him sweat and that was leading him to become dehydrated.	2	2		2																					
235	3	The setting affect the cyclist features because if the cyclist was riding in @LOCATION1 around june the affect @MONTH1 not had been that harsh. But overall the setting out begin in a hot place with limited water was not a good thing. That�s how the cyclist is affected by the setting.	1	1		1																					
238	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� time setting very much affects the cyclist during the story. One of the things that affect him during the story is that it was a very hot, sun scorching day. Also he ran out of water and there was nothing but desert and poisonous snakes around. Another thing is that when he ran out of water there was no snakes warmers  just desert so he started to become very thirsty. In the essay it also said he reached a part where she saw a sign that said � Rough Road Ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limited, so the road conditions starting to get rough him that was another affect. In the end of the essay he reaches a camp where it is all peace and relaxed, and they have cold water there, this affects him because he feels replenished. All these different features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly.	2	2		2																					
239	3	The setting was affecting the character, because as the day got hotter he got thirtier. Also because when he got to the sign about rough roads ahead. He started to get worried and kinda paranoid, so that�s how the setting affected him.	1	1		1																					
240	3	There was a number of things that affected the cyclists during his travel. First off, at the old town there wasn�t any real water he could drink. So he was out of water and was going to be thirsty. Also, it�s the middle of June in California, it�s very hot and size and the is going to wear him out pretty quickly. Another thing that affected the cyclist is the steep hills he has to go up and down. For example, he says �Over one long, crippling hill�, he�s saying the hills are very hard for him. Those are the features that affected the cyclist in the story.	2	1		2																					
241	3	The setting of this essay was the California desert in June. If any of the settings features affected the cyclist(which they all did) This had the biggest impact. In the fifth paragraph, the reader leaves that the author was �travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� My prior knowledge tells me that California is generally always a very hot place especially in the desert in June, the hottest month of the year This would have greatly affected the cyclist. He was riding for over fifty miles through the California desert  with a limited supply of water. This put him at a great risk for dehydration, which he tells the reader he reaches in the last time of paragraph ten. This terrain and the extremely hot conditions would make the cyclist very tired and dehydrated, making his journey to @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1 all the more difficult.	2	2		2																					
246	3	The features of the setting affect cyclist in many was it was like a crazy maze, the road he was own, and him not really knowing were he was going didn�t help him, or not having enough water. This is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
251	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the authour was not and augsosted and as she was ridding her bike there was no place for her to stop and fill up her water bottle.	1	1		1																					
253	3	"The cyclist on her trips sees a lot of features that would discourage her. She is riding in high desserts of california in June"" (kurmaskie). We all know desserts are steaming hot and dry especially in june. She also encounters hills (kurmaskie) to make matters wose she was travelling on hills in the extreme heat.Though the cyclist goes through many perilous obstacles she makes it to a camp a lives I could seethe horizon, telling myself that I could make it that par, I'd be fine.""(kurmaskie) This shows the author's dedication and that if you don tgive up you will be fine."	2	2		2																					
257	3	"In the story ""Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" the mans ride gets pretty rough. Because he took the old mens advice on a shortcut, the once enjoyable ride became a  "	1	1		1																					
259	3	The features of setting affect the cyclist in many ways. At first when he sees the tall pines and the river he is calm: and chilled out. But when he sees the abandoned �@PERSON1�s Grape Juice� factory he becomes desperate and thinks he is going to die out in the desert. A guy travels to @ORGANIZATION1 where he meets �old timers and the give him a �shortcut� to the park. He then goes on his bike to the park taking their �shortcut.� While traveling starts to run out of water and then he thinks he is going to die out in the desert. �It din�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� This quote means now that he is out in the desert he thinks he is going to die since he has no more water. This relates because he becomes desperate  for water because he is out in the desert in the midde of June.	2	2		2																					
263	3	This story was a great motivation for older man that can still be healthy and feel like an teenager again. It showed how much effort he put to his goal and how he survive. Forty miles he peddled for forty miles to drink same water the cyclist was and interesting story not ginaupup	1	1		1																					
267	3	"The features of the setting affect the cy clist in many ways. For example the lack of water was the biggest thing. Without cool water he had nothing to reboost his energy. He would get tired out faster. Even he does find water its hot, like when he says,� brakish water feeling some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� This shows how in �the high desert of June,"" the water is all very hot. Even after he pumped the well for several minutes the water still wouldn�t cool down the hot desert had baked everything above and below ground. So when you go to get something liquid which heats and cools faster than solids it will be hot. Also the rough road made it difficult for the cyclist to travel it. We know the roads rough when he says, �large highway signs dumped out at me. It read ROUGH ROAD AHEAD DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. ""This also shows you couldn�t go fast."	3	2		3																					
277	3	The features of the setting greatly effect he cyclist one way it effects him is because it is so hot and he doesn�t here any water left. Also because their are so many almost buildingc and ghost towns this gives him cables haze that he will be able get the water.	1	1		1																					
278	3	Almost all of the cyclist�s surroundings are old and barren. Hot @CAPS1 like weather. The road is hard to ride on. �Flat Road was replaced by short rolling hills.� So his ride was a very rough and tiresome one.	1	1		1																					
282	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in @CAPS1 ways. The cyclist was in California in June weather. If it wasn�t so hot, he wouldn�t have needed water as badly. He wouldn�t have been sweating as much. Also, there weren�t any buildings or cars around, so there wasn�t anyone to help him. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structures of any kind.� @CAPS1 features of the setting could affect the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
288	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he was in a forest. This was a bumpy trip with a lot of troubles along the way. This was along trip. But he made it tough with a story to tell in the end.	1	1		1																					
291	3	The whys  the  setting  affected  the  cyclist  is  that  the  hotter  it  was  the  more  water  that  he  drank.  Also the further he  travled  the  more  tired  he  got  which caused him to get hotter  and  which  caused  him  to  drink  more  of his water.	1	1		1																					
293	3	The hot, dry, and baron setting affect the cyclist greatly. Baron is a hot, dry and abanded place. The cyclist is trying to ride his bike to Yosemite national park. He decides to follow the directions of coaple old men, which was a mistake.��Simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades,�(Kurmaskie). The hot and dry conditions made the cyclists hardest obstacle to be staying hydrated.	2	2		2																					
297	3	The feature of the setting affected the cyclist because of the bad conditions of the road and the not sun and the desserts and the low amount of energy supply he had left the reasons why  	1	1		1																					
303	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. Ranging from temperature, surroundings, and the availability of water. First of all, the cyclist felt tired and exhausted because of the temperature and terrain, For example, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� I can imagine the cruelty of the heat beating down on him while riding down the roads. It would make me tired and exhausted also. Second of all, the surroundings as he rode affected him and made him have less confidence as he rode further. For example, �This place might have been a thriving little spetatore time say, before the last world war-last on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� It shows how the information he had been giving caused him to feel unsure of where he was going. I�d feel uncapable and would do the same in his situation. Lastly, the lack of water made him scared. For example, �conserve my water and go instead for an hour or so a lest of my inner spirit.� It made him think the situation wasn�t good. So as one can see, it affected the cyclist in many ways.	1	1		1																					
304	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the author uses features of the setting to show the effects of the cyclist. In the essay the rider gets directions from two old men on a perch. In the essay it said, �Never accept braid advice from  a collection of old- timers who haven�t let be able centres of their porch since carter was in office. �This shows the old man could be wrong and places can change. Also, on this short cut he almost runs out of water. The essay ststed I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or se � a test of my inner spirit. He is running out of water but has the determination to get to @CAPS1 last the terrain affects him. The Hills prove to be a challenge with a limited supply of water. The essay states. Flat roads were upleed by sheed, rolling hills. This shows he is extremely determined. Even though the hills added to the struggle he made it through. That is how the author used features of the setting to add to the struggle of the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
306	3	After the cyclist spoke to the �old timers who hadn�t left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office,� his confidence in them began to ware. He entered the desert happy, hopeful and determined. As his water reservoir began to disappear, and he approached the sight of the old shed, canal and a couple water pump, he began to feel touched. He made an attempt to get the water from the pumps and it was hot and �tested like battery acid�. As he rode on, his confidence only faded more. He travelled through the desert and �ridiculously large snake� and was running low on water. Finally he saw a building in the distance, which ironically enlights was an abandoned juice factory a sign featuring a left sipping on some succulent icy liquid teased ruin, and he began to lose hope. He didn�t think he would make it to his destination or anywhere else for that matter. Although after approaching the old factory, he came across a bait shop where his hope and energy was founded.	3	3		3																					
309	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the setting often affects the character. One example of this is when the character got to a place where there was nothing. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me�. This quote explains that the character (cyclist) was confused. Another example of this harsh setting is when the water in his bottle feels @NUM1 degrees. �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� That quote suggests that it is hot outside, which would make the water hot. Another example of the setting is when the terrain changed. ""@CAPS1 road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This made the biker have to work harder, and use more energy. These conditions all made the cyclist have to work harder to find his destination."	3	2		3																					
314	3	During the cyclist�s trip, he experienced physical and mental strain. The intense heat, rough terrain, the animals and his isolation all contributed to his strain while completing his challenging task. His isolation while cycling down the �shortcut� was a definite factor in his strain. @PERSON1 stated that, � there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� All @PERSON1 had to focus on was accomplishing his task. There wasn�t anybody nearby to help him and there wasn�t any shelter for him to take to escape the heat. The heat itself played a very predominant factor in Kurmaskie�s physical strain. The heat caused him to become dangerously thirsty and required him to find an abundance of water fast. Kurmaskie stated, � the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke� This statement proves that the intense temperature was a life threatening factor. The rough terrain and snake and two factors in his trip that just helped make his journey even more cruel. The physical strain of avoiding a snake in the middle of the road and the dangerous terrain just put him in a more grading position. 	3	2		3																					
321	3	Whether the lack of water, the hills, the tumble weeds � all are things that affect the cyclist. The lack of water affects the cyclist because it is hot outside and he needs water. The hills also affect him because it is hard to peddle up hills. Finally is the tumbleweeds. The tumble weeds show a distinct desert look. When he sees tumble weeds he try�s to keep balance because he is partially dehydrated and doesn�t want to crash. The dehydration / lack of water affect the author because he is very thirsty and everyone needs water to survive. When you are lack of water and energy it makes your goal more hard to complete.  	2	2		2																					
324	3	The feature of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When in the essay it states, �The sun was beginning to beat down� This shows that this affects how he feels when he is cycling through the road and this can affect his ability to keep cycling while the sun ??? him hard. Also when he states �I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph,� this shows he was also dehydrated once goin, very slow because of the ammount of heat and lack of water that affected his ability to keep cycling in the area.	2	2		2																					
325	3	I believe the cyclist is a alone, and I think the old man should have shot him. I believe a bike ride that long is a little retarded. I feel that no matter how great or horrible the shape your in you should even go on a realling long rider on a bicycle.	1	1		1																					
326	3	The setting affected the cyclist in a big way during his journey. The temperature being so hot tired the cyclist and made him thirsty. Also the hills being so high to ride up made it hard to continue. Since he was in the desert there were not many towns to go to. All these factors affected the cyclist on his journey.	1	1		1																					
328	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because, it is hot, and dry in the California desert when you are on a bicycle, hot and dry with bad directions, and in a desert is bad. It was a long distance ride, in the burning hot sun, with little water, and he thought he was going to die because there was nothing insight. 	1	1		1																					
340	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly in the story. The list desert climate tales damage onto the cyclist by quickly depleting his water supply. He also began to get worried when every town the old men told about turned out to be a ghost town. This crawled doubt in the cyclist mind that he might not survive the �shortcut� told off by the old men.  	1	1		1																					
342	3	@CAPS1   the  story  the  condition of  problem  often effected the mood of the cyclist . For  example when the sign said ,” Rough road ahead: Do not exceed  posted speed limit.” @CAPS1  this time he saw a snake he was scared so he eased  past trying to keep balance while he was  dehydrated . The dry and hot climate began to become problem for the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
347	3	"In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit,� the featurs of the setting had a great deal to do with the cyclist. The rodes were bumpy, windy, and many hills. As the effect of that the cyclist had to drink a lot of water. As the cyclist rode into the so called town he found nothing, as he says �I began to pump the old rusted water pump, but nothing came out except nasty blackish water."""	2	2		2																					
348	3	The way the features of the setting effect  the cyclist in what was, going through hot neighborhoods and very road that made her dehydrated and effected her journey including the long cycling which he had to go up.	1	1		1																					
360	3	"In the essay, ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" the cyclist encountered several problems. The main conflict of the cyclist in this text is the lack of water. Cycling is a vigorous exercise and can take much strength out of a rider. Water is neccesary to make sure the cyclist stays hydrated. In the text, the old men had the cyclist take a detour through desert areas and hilly terains. Because of the hot weather and rough roads the cyclist became dehydrated faster than normal. For  example, the text says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tentalizing sips, wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that i could drop from heatsroke on a gorgeouse day in June."" @CAPS1, by usings vocubulary such as ""tentalizing"" expresses the cyclist need for water. Furthermore, later in the sentence the narrator make a reference to the old men, giving the blame entirely to them for them suggesting the path. Readers can also can conclude that the harsh setting of the essay greatly affected the cyclist"	2	2		2																					
364	3	First, the old men affect the cyclist by throwing him off track. They do this by telling him of a �shortcut� that will take him right to his destination. Then the cyclist was faced with rough rolling hills of a highway. Over his long journey the cyclist still remained determined to reach his destination.	1	1		1																					
368	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclists in a big way because roads had bottles in then that could have caused him to get really hurt. Also, the water he was drinking was streaming and tasted like battery acid. Then came some rolling hills which would be another big challenge for him. The setting was pretty baron for the cyclist because he also come across a snake. Last, he thought he saw some mirages that tells me that the climate is extreme for the cyclists. That�s how the setting affects the cyclists.	1	2		2																					
376	3	IIn the essay the features of the cycleist affect the setting because the readers wouldnt have thought that he was in that bad of danger if he hadnt of been going through the desert. When the cyclist got to the grape factory he stated that he was almost dehydrated. And then when he got to the bait shop he drank from the faucet.	1	1		1																					
379	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because he was biking up hills in extreme heat. He also had a short water supplyl while head in the wrong direction.	2	2		2																					
380	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The directions given to the cyclist by the elderly was incorrect and he got lost. The lack of water led to the possibility to sucking pebbles to forget about his thirst. The rolling hills caused the cyclist to use more energy.These were the affects the setting had to the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
381	3	The feachers of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. When she biked around a bend, �my troubles, thirsts, and fear were all behind me.�	1	1		1																					
383	3	Durring the cyclist @CAPS1 he was affected by the setting frequently. When he was cycling it be came very hott to him but at first it wasn�t so bad. �The sun was begining to beat dow, but I barely Noticed it.� This proves that the cyclist knows it was getting hot but it did not affect him. Another thing that affected him was the time that he was travling in. �I had been hitting my water bottles pritty regularly and I was travling through the high dezerts in califonia in June.� This proves that the reader was constantly drinking because of the time of day and year he was out. All of this shows that the setting affected the cyclist on his @CAPS2. 	2	2		2																					
385	3	"The features of the setting effect the cyclist in, �Do not Exceed posted speed Limit.� By changing him physically. He was in the California desert in the middle of June without any water left. This was taking a physical toll on him. His physical effect was making him feel hopeless as well. He says, �It was a sad hopeless laugh mind you, but at least l still had the energy to feel sorry for myself."" So the way he was suffering from dehydration physically effected his emotional state because he felt as though there was nothing he could do. Had he been in another place, for example @LOCATION2, where it does not get newly a shot as soo thon California, he would not have been suffering from dehydration, as have been in such an isolated place. His cycling could be compared to the climbers who were lost in the snow storm in @LOCATION3. Instead of dehydration and heat strone, however they suffered from hypothermia. Had they been on a different mountain, there would have been no snow storm and they would be fine. The outcome of this story and the climbers was determined by their setting."	3	2		3																					
389	3	In this story, �No Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, by be Joe Kurmaskie I believe the setting greatly affect the cyclist. I believe this because when it�s long downhill cool roads is fine but if it is straight uphill roads and extremely hot he feels like he can�t keep pedaling. The cyclist gets very weary when the setting is out in the hot desert with no one around so the setting has a huge affect on the mood in this story. Another example	2	2		2																					
400	3	The features of the setting did affect the cyclist in this small story. In this story the setting is a hot dry terrain which can be better explained by the name California. This heat of the desert climate seems to start have an effect on him about after he reaches the first town. I know this by his statement.�This place might have been a thriving little spot at time �say, before the last war-but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chucked, checked my water supply and moved on. The the sun was beginning to beat down. The summer heat is thriving how during this @DATE1 and he is drinking lots of water.�So this setting does affect him greatly it causes him to use his water supply and it causes him to begin the process of dehydration. I know how the summer heat can affect you during @DATE1 activity �s. At times it feelslike you are going to die but that building is always around the bend just for the cyclist.  	3	2		3																					
404	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The reasons were the water and the hills. One reason was water because his water were cooled down offer he refilled it all the way up. My last reason is because of the rolling hills.	1	1		1																					
414	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by making him tiered, scared, thirsty and cause him to worry. The setting was a hot California day in June and the cyclist was riding through the heat and over the hills and difficult terrain. The cyclist describes the land when he says, �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� He also says, �Over one long, crippling hill.� As the cyclist gets further and further, he has more doubt. Fear and thirst start to get to him. He says, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean.� When the cyclist finds the bait shop he has almost lost all hope. On his way to the shop he says, �Slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� At the end, the setting makes the cyclist regain his strength as he sees the bait shop, when he sees it, he says, �Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst and fear were all behind me.� The features of the setting put the cyclist in an unsteady ride of fear, hope and confidence	3	3		3																					
419	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed posted Speed Limit.� The feautures of the of the area the cyclists rides through affect him greatly. For example when the narration says, �At some point, humble weeds crossed my path� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The tone of the cyclists from the quote above shows despare creeping into his mind. Also, another good example is when the narration says, �@CAPS1 hill, a building came into view� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist sounds more hopfull than before. That is how the area the cyclist enters affects him.	2	2		2																					
426	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead : Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit,�  by Joe Kurmaskie�  the features of the setting affects the cyclist. Dehydration caused by heat could not enough water caused the cyclist to sweat and to feel nautious. �wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke, caused me to laugh. In this quote he is thinking about all the bad and horrible things that could happen to him because he is already in an bad state. In conclusion, this is how the features of the setting affects the cyclist.	2	0		1																					
428	3	Some of the things that affect the cyclist was the lack of water. �The water, bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips, water is a big importance. To stort men. Your body need water to work right. The @CAPS1 humid, dry weather of California was a affect To. �The high deserts of California in June.� �l could drop from a heatstroke.� The sun is unbearable, expessary without shade and water, @CAPS2 affect on the cyclist up. The have of animals � There was No- one in sight.� It would have been a lot easier for the cyclist if store or people would have been around, @CAPS2 exact is the animals. �A @CAPS3 large   snake crossed my path.� �diamondback- blocked the majoritly of the pavement. It would have been to worry about those things these are all things that affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
431	3	There were many different conditions that effected the cyclist. He did not have the proper ammount of water for the journey witch made it difficult. He states in the story, �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1 the terrain and hills made it difficult. He ran into snakes and very deserted country. But his determination led to success and arrived into a town	2	2		2																					
432	3	"In the short story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. When he arrives in the first �town� that the old men told him to go to, the cyclist �chuckled and moved on�, and acted just sort of indifferrenth, to seeing this old town. As he reached �the fork of sorts� twenty miles up the road, ""the sight was troubling to him his water supply was somewhat deterriorating, so he became a bit uncered. Finally when the cyclist read the sign that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the author continued to move on, but with a large chunk of his confidence gone. He was dehydrated, toned, and had lost a lot of hope after coming across all these places. When he saw the sign for Gary and Wilber�s fish camp, he was as happy as could be, knowing he would drink some water continue his journey the next day, and not listen to old men�s directions again. Many people in stories or in real life are affected by the setting they are in. In the novel @CAPS1 of champions by @PERSON1, one of the characters named @ORGANIZATION1 went on a journey to find an art exhibition, running into many problem's on the way, which in many cases, gave him a lack of hope in reaching his destination safely."	3	3		3																					
433	3	Some features can affect the cyclist. The weather can slow them down like if it was cold or hot outside it can slow the person down. If the person does not	1	1		1																					
446	3	The features of the setting in this story, �Do not exceed Posted Speed limit,� affect the cyclist in a huge way. The cyclist was biking through California in a desert-like area. It can get very hot there,like the writer describes, �wide rings of sweat circled my shirt.� The fact that the area he was biking through, and that he out of water put himself into serious danger. Also, since the cyclist had no water he was becoming dehydrated. The area he was biking through had barely any people. This means there was no water available for him. Therefore, if the setting had taken place in a cooler setting with lots of people, the cyclist would have found water. Without this type of setting, the story would have completely changed.  	2	2		2																					
447	3	The setting very much affects the cyclist. �I maneuvered down the hill.� This statement shows him going down the hill. If the hill wasnt there then it would hawe been a whole lot easier for him to get to where he was going, also he would have had more energy. If there werent anyhills to get in his way.	2	1		2																					
454	3	Each person has a really good ability that stands out. Someone can be good looking, smart or confident. Someone @MONTH1 never give up and do what he wishes to do. The cyclist in the story is or man with a strong will. He wants to be alive. He saw too many difficult in his way to get the place he wanted to be. He listened to some old guys and he lost his way. The sun was beginning to beat down. He was out of water but he continued riding to reach his goal. He was losing his strength. The weather  was @NUM1�@CAPS1.The  water  tasted  like  acid battery. He  believed  himself  that he can be alive. He got stronger by believing in himself eventhough he was losing strength. Every place that he passed by was a new experienced for life. They were like a game that he came successful. He never give up. He did everything he could do to not losing his mind. He didn�t want lose the battle in his mind.   	2	3		3																					
458	3	The features of the setting been amajor affect of this cyclist  in the  story. On the normal road, the ground is smooth but think is a lot like and winding. The cyclist also comes across bumps, non-paved roads that make it hard to meneuver through. Then you add the fact that there is not really any towns and he is a blazing heat with little water. The setting of this passage played a key role in the story.         	2	1		2																					
459	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in the high deserts of California where it is very hot so, you need alot of water. Then he needs more water and finds a water pump but cant use the water because it was �some where in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" Then the terrain in changes when he says �Flat road was replaced "	1	2		2																					
462	3	In the beginning the cyclist was ready to go and happy. By the time he got half way there he was �losing hope�. It was very hot and he was simple alone. By the end, he was relieved because not only did he find water, he found an easier way to get to Yosemite. The first old group of men didn�t help, but the second man did.	1	1		1																					
466	3	The setting plays an important part in the authors mood. When the author finds the dilapidated ghost town, he is still high spirited and amused. He thinks that it is a little funny that the old men�s �town� was now abandoned. ��(the town) fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled�� This shows that the author is still in good spirits because he can still laugh. When �a tar like substance  oozed out of the water pump at the next stop the author became a little unsettled, as the author was running low on water. But he was still optomistic. Once the rolling expansive hills came into view, the author  let out a �sad, hopeless laugh.� The author was depressed , dehydrated and had all but given up , however he kept going and eventually made it to some water.	3	3		3																					
467	3	In the passage �Rough Road Ahead Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� the setting must definetly affects the cyclist. When the cyclist comes for the first abandured �town� he searches for water but finds only that which tastes like battery acid �when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid.� The makes his dehydration seem much worse because of the fact that he has water it is just undrinkable. The rough road ahead there gives the feeling of determination because when the cyclist in on his last legs he must work even harder to get water a flat road was replaced by short rolling hills,� this quote shows that despite his condition the cyclist most perservere. Also quote �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridicuosly large snake ��tumble weeds and snakes give the feeling of desolation and of being alone, which is what the cyclist is this point. The setting of this story directly correalates with how the cyclist is feeling.	3	3		3																					
470	3	The setting affected the cyclist greatly. He had no water and he was �traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The deserts and no water could have been life-or-death to him, making him stressed and thirsty. Couple that with him biking, and you have yourself a dehydrated man in the desert! When he was between the �ghost town� and bait shop he says, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind, This would make the cyclist think that there is no hope for his survival if he passed out. The deserts of California affects any cyclist greatly especially one without water like the cyclist in the story. 	2	2		2																					
471	3	It think  it means  to be all you can be.	0	0		0																					
480	3	The features in the setting of this story affect the cyclist very much so. Throughout this story this poor person has to get lost and end up in the middle of nowhere. By her being out her cycle was being affected. She was just trying to get somewhere and get things done, but of course she didn�t. She kept moving on down. This story was very good and showed that she cared and wanted it bad.	1	1		1																					
484	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist should had looked at his map instead of taking the old man advise because all the information was on the map. He almost died because he listened to the old men and didn�t look at his map. If the cyclist was in a car mabey he would have better luck because he would be going  faster than the @NUM1 bike.	3	3		3																					
491	3	In the story the cyclist is afected by setting because in the @NUM1 paragraph it talks about him seeing the old water pump and how he was trying to get water out. At the end of the story he gets angry when he sees the old welches juice factory because he relizes that the old men didn�t know what they were talking about. Also at the end he is realived when he finds Gary and @ORGANIZATION1 because there is water there. 	1	1		1																					
497	3	The cyclist had very little water. It was very hot. He had a long way to go. The road was very bumpy so he couldn�t go to fast or he�s tire�s might bust. There were know cars in site so if he did break down it would have taken even longer.	1	1		1																					
498	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways. And following old timers advice wasn't too smart of him. In that essay he was headed to the Yosemite National Park, he had a map to follow and he trusted himself, he a cyclist he knows his way around. But came around a couple of men who told him a shortcut. He trusted them which he shouldn't have and he was on his way. The setting was rough. He was riding through a California desert; which was probably way too not, and he was looking water. The only thing that he found tasted live battery and so that no good for him. It was a flat land, than rolling hills. The next town would have been in the @NUM1 miles. This cyclist was hilling himself. While riding along these lands there was more in sight, and no building or cars it was line a dead road. Those old men had him through neck and been, once he made it to the next town he knew with those conditions	3	2		3																					
505	3	There were a few features in the setting that affected the cyclist. One very important feature is that the cyclist was in the desert. This is demonstrated by the statement �I was travelling through the high deserts of California.� not only was the cyclist in the desert, he was there in June, one of the hottest months of the year. It is demonstrated that he was there in June reading to the statement �I was travelling in June.� @CAPS1 there at that time made dehydration a bigger risk. It was also very hot there. We know this because when he was at the water pump, he stated, �blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� From this, we can affirm that not only was at hot, the water was dirty. The water also �had the flavor of battery acid.� This was bad for the cyclist who was running low on water because he �had been hitting (his) water bottles pretty regularly.� The fact that he had little water left is demonstrated in the statement, �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� The cyclist was in a bad situation. These had ganged-up against him in his trip. These features are the desert, the high temperatures, and the blackish water which tasted like battery acid. The fact that he was low on water made it harder to fight these features with water, he would battle the desert, high temperatures, and have no need to pump bad water. Again, the features of the setting that affected the cyclist are the desert, the high temperatures, and the bad water which he could not drink.	3	3		3																					
508	3	In the story, �Rough Road Ahead�, by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist was affected by the setting. The cyclist has said that he had to ride over terrain that was smooth at first but then turned into rolling hills. He also had to find his way around a big snake while being dehydrated. The cyclist was mainly affected because he was out of water when he was riding on his bike through a desert like area, but because he was determined to reach water he made it through.	2	2		2																					
512	3	In the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the setting greatly affects the cyclist. With long rides, hilly roads, and very little water the cyclist was pretty good. I mean he could have been very angry but he kept his cool and stayed calm.	1	1		1																					
518	3	Condition the cyclist is in affect a lot of how they ride. One example of this is, �I was travelling through the high desert of California in June.� @CAPS1 to this fact the cyclist had went into a �dehydrated state� because of not having much water. When your travelling in hot weather areas without much water your body will become dehydrated from sweating. Cycling in different conditions will affect cyclists diffently.	1	1		1																					
519	3	Many features of the setting affected the cyclist in �Rough Road Ahead.� First, the scorching heat of the desert  in June was a major problem that had him to the brink of dehydration. In the text it states, �I could drop from heatstroke in a gorgeous day in June (@CAPS1).� This shows the effect the exposure  to heat had on @NUM1 cyclist. Also, the terrain posed a threat to his well being during the story. In the text it says �I toiled on( @CAPS2).� This shows the increase in effort in strain the  terrain caused on the cyclist during his adventure.	2	2		2																					
528	3	The setting affects alot in a cyclist. For example if you are in a city you seel rush tired and everweled. But in a forest you are happy and a bit less stress. A setting sets the mode also the attude in the story.	1	1		1																					
530	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the unbearable setting effects the cyclist with its harsh conditions. At first, in the cyclist�s own words, � things began well enough.� @CAPS1, this soon changes. The road is long and filled with obstacles and the cyclist has hardly any water to sip. He does not give up, @CAPS1, in the text it says, �got back on the bike, but not bothered gathered up a few peldder and stuck them in my mouth.� He does this in order to reduce his need for water and continues, ignoring the tall the setting brings upon him.	2	2		2																					
541	3	First the bike encounters flat roads in the desert which are very easy to navigate through; when he gets to his first town he still goes on trying to get to Yosemite, then after is going low so he looks for some more water to help him go. Then he kept going and he experienced a fork in the road. After the fork he kept going and he then faced another problem. That problem was an old person told him to go @NUM1 miles to the town and he didn�t trust the guy. Then the biker listened and he went on down the road. He then faced his next problem. The flat road started to get very wary with short high and low hills. These hills reduced his stamina greatly. Then he had to deal with a rocky and bumpy desteart road. He then had to face a snake and he had to avoid it so it didn�t attack him. Finally the biker faced his  las long hill and he finally found a bait and tackle shop with lots of water.	2	2		2																					
543	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is going to be on the road a long time. The features of no buildings, no people and no cars, affect on the rider is that he feels helpless when he is low on water. The ghost town doesn�t help he because the old man told him about it and he thought he would be able to get more water. The grape juice factory affected him because he thought he would get a drink but it was abanded. This is how the features affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
547	3	The author think that the setting means he is not getting any closer to his destination. However, he found out that there was still people around. He paniced and thought he was going to die. The places were desserted and he thought the lead nowhere. He was a little scared at the fact he might die because of everything around him was in a sense dead.	2	2		2																					
550	3	"The setting really afeted the cyclist alot.The sun and hot weather dehidrated him. He also had pretty much ran out of water. In the story he says ""The bottles contained only a few drops this shows that he had drank almost all of his water. Then it says ""the growing relization that I could drop from a leaf stroke"" shows the heat was affecting him."	2	2		2																					
552	3	The setting of this story is very rigurous. At the begining of the story the boy was fine. He had a bottle of water with him so that he didn�t get dehydrated. When he was riding he started to feel the sun get higher into the sky, though he could barely feel. It because of the pines that caused the road, and the cool feel of the river. The cyclist got to the second town on his journey and he had been drinking his water all day and was about out. He had found a water pump. He got down on his knees and palled with his night hot all that came but was blackish water. He just feared the water and stated that it tasted like battery acid. He began to ride again. Not two miles up the road the terrain changed. Not only was it rolling hills, it was also getting hotter. He was majorly dehydrated because he was out of water except nor a few �tantalizing sips. Dry sweat circled his shirt and he was afraid he could froz up heatstrokes. Where he was at was in the middle of no where, with no buildings, cars or structures in sight. Over were of the hills he saw a building came in no view. He wiped the sweat off his eyes so makee sure it was not a malinge,� By the lols of it had been a Welch�s @CAPS1 @CAPS2 Factory.� He is a dehydrated and tired that he could see a �Young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.� There is only the problems it is abandoned. This person was imagining things. He got back on his bike and stuck pebbles into mouth. This was to help tabe his mind off being thirst.	3	2		3																					
553	3	I read �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� written by Joe Kurmaskie in the story the features of the setting affect the cyclist by accepting advice from �old timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches @CAPS1 was in office�	1	1		1																					
556	3	The settings to this story has an encouraging impact on this story, because he is an alike ride. The terrain in the story sounds rough where he seen a sign marked, �Rough road ahead do note exceed posted speed limit.� He already has to go up and down hills with rocks and no water. Such a setting an a really athletic ride can be devastating. 	1	1		1																					
565	3	The cyclist in the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� is about a great adventure gone bad. He has every thing he needs but some how it turns out bad. He get low on water & the setting is horrible. He is on his way from a camp ground in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1 to the Yosemite river. He gets bad directions from old guys at the camps ground. On his way he ran into two abandon towns & was running out of water then he came to a sign that said, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� He was pedeling over hills & becoming dehydrated when he tought he was going to die he came to a bait shop & got waiter & met an old guy who was going to give him direction & he decided he better stick to the map. Even though the setting got worse through the story & stuck it out & made it to the end.	3	2		3																					
572	3	The setting affected the cyclist, because he didn�t know if he was going to die or live. He had used up all his water because it was so hot and his mouth was dry.	1	1		1																					
574	3	With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place things change No a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist. Never travel advice home old-timers who haven�th confines of use porches.Flat road was replaced by short rolling hills. Rough Road ahead Do not exceed posted speed limit.	1	1		1																					
585	3	The features of the setting have a big impact on the cyclist. One feature is the hot weather and area he is in. He says he is in the �high desserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 being hot in @CAPS2, it has cyclist is around deserts, causing more heat. �I could drop from a heatstroke,� he says. Being hot from the sun beating down on him took away the cyclist�s energy he needs for riding his bike. Another feature that affected the cyclist was his lack of water. �Trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� This affected the cyclist by making him tired. Being tired from no water, the cyclist had trouble going up hills on his bike. The last feature that affected the cyclist was all of the hills in his road. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� These hills made it hard to go up on a bike, considering his lack of water, and the heat. All of these features affect the cyclist by making him lose energy and get tired and frustarated because of their negative impact.	3	3		3																					
586	3	Nature has an affect on everyone, even when they don�t think it does. Expecially for cyclist traveling anywhere or everywhere. In �Do not exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie is a perfect example about settings laffect people like cyclist. When you�re riding your bike as actually cross country transportation, you have to know what your doing and where you�re going. The cyclist in this story decided to take advice from older fellows and ends up going the wrong route for a cyclist because at these �town� they had no water, because they weren�t towns to begin with, not anymore atleast. If you don�t have any water like this guy did hills could kill you. And in any case, you have to know what to do for example.� l gathered a few pebbles and struck them in my mouth. I�d read once that sucking on stones help take your mind off thrist� This guy knew a little bit of survival tips. If he�d gone all that way without standing up yo his thrist and those hills, he probably would have had some kind of stroke. That is just a few way that setting could harm you.  	3	3		3																					
587	3	Some of the feature setting that effect the cyclist was the seal was begging to lent down, but he truly noticed it and about twenty miles up the road he came to park of sorts. The cyclist was riding through the high deserts of California in June. He get on his hands and hence working on the heated handle of the rusty pump. The pump began it shoot out a tarlike substance and the water was feeling somewhere of two hundred degrees. Two more miles I noticed the terrain changing from a flat road to a short, rolling hills.� He said tumble weeds crossed her path and a large snake crossed her pavement. He gather some pebbles and stuck them in his mouth, after reading that if sucking of stones helps to be your mind off thirst. Well after reading of I believed these settings did effect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
595	3	The setting effects the cyclist in many ways, first is that it is very hot in the desert. Second is that there aren�t many towns out there. Finally is that water is hard to find out there, so if he get thirsty it would be hard to get more water if you didn�t find a town.	1	1		1																					
597	3	The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist by describing that he is in a desert-like area in Lodi, California. They say it is very hot and there is sand everywhere. There also aren�t many places to cool off at. They also described the water and Lodi to be about @NUM1 degree in temperature. The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite to get away from the heat and to have a cool, shady pine trees to sit under, and cool fresh water. This affects the cyclist because he gets dehydrated because of the horrid heat.	2	2		2																					
600	3	The features of the setting that affect the cyclist are the terrain, the lack of provisions and the power of self- determination. The terrain affected the cyclist by having he/she ride through rough paths inorder to reach their destination.For example, if you walk on sharp rocks, you are based to reach some rough spots where it seems you can�t walk. But that is where self�determination kicks in. The power to keep yourself moving even though there @MONTH1 be obstacles in your way; you know there will be a better path or a reward at the end another example of a feature is a lack of provision on your trip, when you don�t have the right provision to keep you self energised you can �t get over your obstacles or even push yourself to do anything.This is why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
602	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the cyclist is tired and thirsty already. The features include a desert like setting of California, it is extremely hot, there are no signs of civilization in sight, and the roads are like hills that always were throughout the desert. On top of those facts the cyclist is dehydrating because his water suposely has diminished. 	1	1		1																					
607	3	When the biker listened to the old folks he had confidence. He biked to the first town but it was like a �ghost town.� A town is a town. soon after that, he did not see anything. No cars, buildings, or anything. He was getting sad and dehydrated. The old men swore there was a town coming up so he put his trust and confidence in him once again. He saw a building  coming up, but it was just an old wore down factory. He thought he was let down. He was sure he was going to die, right there right now. He than saw a siga for a fish comp! He was overjoyed! The place was real to! He thought of them as his savior! The settings effect the cyclist tremendously.	1	2		2																					
610	3	The setting in the story was hot. The biker was sweating a lot. The whole town was empty. He pasted empty buildings. Their were rivers and big hills that he had to ride through. As it says about the buildings, �somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� The setting would affect the cyclist because their was no one in the town. Also, their was high hills.	1	1		1																					
619	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because they made the simplist challenges for him. The back of water and the snake in his path are examples.	1	1		1																					
620	3	First, by accepting the old mens� advice, the cyclist was setting himself up for some hardships that he would, easily have avoided by using his map. He first encounters a �ghost town�, lifeless and most importantly, waterless. Then, he encounters a pump that gives out water tasting like �battery acid�. Next he rides past a �Rough Road Ahead� sign; not the most encouraging thing on his journey. To add to the despair, he has to manever his way past a tempting yet empty juice factory. Finally, the parched cyclist arrives at �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp. �To him, this simple bait shop was like  beacon of hope from food himself.	2	3		3																					
622	3	Through most the story, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in a more negative way. For instance, he makes it to this town a guy swore was there, but it turned out to be abandoned. So he let out a sad, hopeless laugh and still had energy to feel sorry for himself. Another feature was the Grape Juice Factory, also abandoned, so he hung his head and that blues tune �summer time� rattled in his brain. A third feature was his thirst. So he stuck some pepples in his mouth to take his mind off it. Then he thought about how lucky he�d be if he checked, @CAPS1 negative to me.	2	2		2																					
638	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The temperature in the area affect the way he drinks his water which leads him to thinking he is going to die because he is running out of water. The �towns� he comes to are so deserted he thinks he is going in the wrong direction. All the settings in the story also help him not to give up but keep on going. In conclusion even though he had to go through all that doubt he was going to be alive in the end he still went on and tried. In the end he did make it and all it was worth it.	2	2		2																					
646	3	During the cyclist journey to Yosemite many things got in his way and slowed him down. For example, he listened to the old men who gave him wrong directions to where he wanted to go. Also, his water supply was getting low which drained his energy alot quicker than usual. The heat also played a part of his energy loss. The heat made him sweat perfusely which made the water that was in his body be of no use.    	2	1		2																					
657	3	The features of the setting gradually contribute to the cyclist�s anger. For example, at the beginning of the story, the cyclist comes across poisonous snakes, �one ramshacke shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule.� All of sights trouble the narrator, and he starts to becom frightened and neurotic. As he cycles on, the narrator begins to deplete his water supply, and when he stops to restock, �the water wouldn�t cool down� and �it had the flavor of battery acid. The cyclist�s lack of water frustrates him, and the increasing steepness of the hills adds to his annoyance. The final straw came when the cyclist passed by what he thought �had been a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory.� The narrator goes on in an outrage to explain that hopes to die out on the road, in order to spare himself from the dreaded features of the setting.  	3	2		3																					
665	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist greatly. It made him become dehydrated. For example, in paragraph @NUM1 sentence @NUM2 he stated �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� This shows how the heat and climate of the setting affected him by how he was getting thrown off balance and wears     to him getting dehydrated. The setting of the story �Do not exceed posted speed limit,� by Joe Kurmaskie, effects the cyclist in the story.	1	1		1																					
667	3	Joe Kurmaskie had a rough time trying to get to Yosemite National park. First, he received directions from an old man, Joe followed these instructions; little did he know that he would be headed for many hardships. After he reached the first town he checked his supply. About @NUM1 more miles he reliced his bottle was getting low because he was travelling through the high deserts of California. It is hot cool out there,then the terrain changed. He no longer had that much water. He ran into a snake, which he swore was a alamond back. Finally, he came to another town, got some water and then left after going through ghost towns. Riding in conditions that are hot and unfamiliar are hard to do. Adding hills to heat is not a good combination, with nothing around val it can be very dangerais, even fatal. Before you bike thinkof what conditions are ahead of you	3	2		3																					
673	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. At first it was a bright shiny day and the cyclist was happy. He reaches the first town which is a ghost town and it makes him sad. Riding on he begins to lose water. The once bright shiny day began to beat the heat down on the cyclist. He reached a ramshackle shed and began to lose hope. He loses water quickly and becomes more dehydrated. The terrain become slopes and hills and the ride become harder, when he reached the grape drink factory his hopes were almost gone. But just over the hill was a fishing shop. He used his reining energy to speed down the hill to get water and get his energy back. 	1	1		1																					
676	3	The cyclist was affected by the fact that he took advice from some old men who�s information was not accurate. Then he cycled along the desert which was very hot. He had a limited supply of water and that also affected him in a very bad way. He almost had a heat stroke a few times. He was probably angry that he took these men�s advice and got himself into this. Then when he found the fish camp, he was overjoyed with relief. But at the same time, if he had asked someone else for directions, he would not have been in this situation in the first place. So it�s really confusing because he probably felt relived and mad at the same time. And then the other old man asked him did he know the best way there. He was right to say yes because if he didn�t, the old man would have gave him some more messed up direction and he would have been out there again, about to have another heat stroke.	3	2		3																					
678	3	"In the short story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit it is shown that the features of the setting do affect the cyclist through the story. In the story the cyclist is faced with the mental and physical journey he takes while riding his bike. Being unware of where he is on his journey the setting begins to really affect him. For example as he keeps making his journey he is affected by the old towns and desert places he even says that ""The sight was troubling."" As he continues to California in June the heat and the long journey really began to affect him both mentally and physically. For example he says, ""I got down my hands and knew working the hands of the rusted water pump with all my strength."" The quote shows because he is biking so long is looking water and there is not a town is sight he becomes weak and although he is at terminated to make it through this journey he is becoming more hopeless and sorry for himself because of the setting he is placed in.

679	3	�@CAPS1 directions, June, lack of water� all are elements that effect the rider on his ride. He took directions from older people who promised the rider a short cut. I turned out that their short cut was wrong. When the rider went on this trip, it was June in California. It would have been burning hot. Lastly he had drank most of his water during the trip. He could have died if he didn�t find the other water source. These were some elements that effected the rider on his trip.	2	2		2																					
683	3	Features of the setting such as the hot sun, no water, and �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp,� greatly affected the cyclist. Since the cyclist was traveling through the high desserts of California in June, the temperature was really high and the hot sun left �wide rings of dried sweat� on his shirt and made the cyclist realize that he could drop from a heatstroke. Also, the fact that the only water around felt �somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees� and �had the flavor of battery acid� prevented the cyclist from drinking it and put him in a �dehydrated state.� @CAPS1, �Gary and Wilber�s Fish Camp� affected the cyclist by solving his problem of dehydration, since there was cold water availible for him upon arrival.	2	2		2																					
688	3	Snake, heat, hills-all are what the biker had to deal with because of certain settings. He had to deal with a diamond back. He was going through the desert so it was like @NUM1 degrees. While he was biking he had to go up crippling hills. He had a redicuious setting to have to bike with. I would never be able to do what he did.	1	1		1																					
689	3	The cyclist had alot of problems with his setting. It was very hot and he started getting low on water. This caused him to become dehydrated. There was hardly any civilization so no one could come to his aid. Also, the path he decided to take was long and vigorous.	1	1		1																					
691	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by the people around the area of @LOCATION1. Taking advice from older people in open landed place can affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
694	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist for many reasons. If the setting is dark trainy, there aren�t going to be ??? running outside. If it is snowing, the ??? are not going to be swimming in the water.	0	0		0																					
695	3	That explains how the features of the setting affect the cyclsit. Is because some people don�t care about there features. Every body are working for a good feature but, others they @CAPS1 still from people who work. Everyday to have a new features.	0	0		0																					
705	3	the setting affects the cyclist very strongly in the story because mentally and physically he wasn�t ready for where he was going. For example the text states �No a better, piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be never. Accept traver advice from a collection of old timers who wasn�t left the cosines of theer poiches since calter was in office.� So a youg guy took maid advice from older guys about how to get to a pack backin thier day it probably was a shortcut.   	1	1		1																					
707	3	Different settings can effect how well your bycycle ride goes. If it is hot and you have lots of hills it makes it hard. If you have no hills and it is a sunny breezy day it makes it nice to ride. In the essay the biker had no water left but was going down a hill. The going down the hill part was probably easy but the fact that he had no water left was not a good thing.	2	3		3																					
709	3	From the setting that affected the cyclist are possible conditions such as the weather and surrounding enviorment like hills and streams or even tyes of animals and if they are poisenous or not. The setting has and can change the desision a cyclist makes.	1	1		1																					
712	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if it�s raining or snowing it affects the cyclist because pavement can be wet and icy. Which causes the cyclist to slip and @DATE1 and the cyclist can really get injured. Also the cyclist has to wear a helmet if it�s very hot outside you wouldn�t see the cyclist in winter clothes. This would make the cyclist unfocus and the cyclist wouldn�t be able to finish any race.	1	1		1																					
713	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he can�t go any farther because of the hills, and the snake. When he finds the bait shop he�s relieved. He relieved because he can get something to drink. He can also buy the worms to eat. The cyclist didn�t really know where he was going because there wasn�t a car, building, or structure in sight. So the cyclist just keeps on riding until he comes across the bait shop or the first �town� as he calls it in the essay. When he comes across the road that has 55 mph per limit, and he�s only 12 he knows that he�s not going anywhere near Yosemite National Park.	2	2		2																					
715	3	The different settings in the essay/ writing affect the cyclist because of how old and hopeless they look. I think this because when the cyclist stops at the first town, he�s looking around expecting to find a quaint, bustling little place, but instead he finds these abandoned, decimated old houses. And if you yourself can picture being in his situation, then you can imagine how discouraging and almost frightening that must be. As the cyclist continues for a few more miles, he�s becoming slowly dehydrated, and finally sees a building. At first, he thinks this building is a mirage; he was wrong, but for him in this situation it was worse- an old juice factory, right when point you kind of get the feeling that every things turning against you and that there�s no hope left. But when he finds the fishing camp, his entire perspective of things changes, and he just feels so thankful to have been saved.	3	3		3																					
727	3	The features of the land around the cyclist caused him to confront  nature. when he began his trip with advice from �old coggers� he � rode out with strong legs and a smile.� As he came to the first town, he describes it as a �ghost town� having no water and no human contact for some time. This should have been his cue to stop and turn around in hopes of another route to Yosemite. But with strong determination, he rods on. Through the miles he incountered a ramshackie shed, rusty pumps, snakes,and the wicked terrain. The short rolling hills tested his �inner spirit� and caused his dehydration to further. The land around the cyclist not only victimized his heath but also caused a poor way to spend a vacation.	2	2		2																					
730	3	In the story the author says, �The sun was beginning to beat down trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state,� This gives you the idea that the heat is getting to him and is steadily depleting his water supply. At ore point he almost gives him self up to despair and dies of dehydration. It seems that he will never reach his good and he will continue to suffer in the grueling heat. I could almost feel the sweat and heat that the cyclist was feeling. Also, I could almost feel the lump in my throat when he says, �with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge a pebble in my throat.� The heat definitely effects this mans cycling in a bad way. He was exhausted and could not go on without water.	2	2		2																					
731	3	The cyclist thought it was hard. Also he was upset that the old timers gave bad directions.	2	2		2																					
737	3	"The setting in the story ""Rough road ahead� plays a great role on the characters journey. Some features that are mentioned in the story are heat, rough road, long crippling hills and a abandoned Grape Juice Factory. The heat in the story drives the cyclist into a dying thirst. @CAPS1 does her best to conserve her water through out the trip but the dry dessert heat doesn�t allow it. Then comes the rough road ahead. The cyclist trys to keep a steady and secure pass as @CAPS1 peddels along the bumps and breaks in the road. The long crippling hills are next in line the cyclist has to use all her energy to work up the hill. @CAPS1 wipes the sweat from her eyes to make sure its not a mirage and then @CAPS1 see�s it the abandoned factory. This is where the cyclist loses all hope for if @CAPS1 doesn�t receive water soon @CAPS1 is sure to be eaten by the birds. �Then, and easily as rounding a band, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. Gary and Wilber Fish Camp.� @CAPS1 rushed to the bathroom to drink the refreshing water to the sink pride and accomplishment overwhelm her."	3	3		3																					
742	3	In many ways, the setting affected his journey to Yosemite. If the setting wouldn't have been so bad, the long ride wouldnt have been as hard on his body. Since the setting was a very hot day in June, in a California desert, when he did find a well he said, � followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. � @CAPS1 thing about the setting is, if it wouldnt have been so hot, he wouldnt have needed as much water. And, if he would have gotten the water he needed because it was so hot, it wouldn't have been so physically draining on his body. I know it was physically draining because he said �  I  could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June. � In conclusion, the setting played a major role in the story.	2	1		2																					
746	3	The riders condition was rough, from flat land to rolling hills. This would be hard for some one who is dehydrating. There was a snake in his path so he went around it. This would be dangerous he could blackout from lack of water and then get bit by the snake.	1	1		1																					
750	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist because where they were.It was like in te middle of nowhere and every person they asked are having all times.They go the wrong directions to the nearest town.The old guy told him it was @NUM1 miles down the road when he went @NUM2 miles to the next town and said to him self he will never take directions from a gut that has all timers and hasn�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.	1	1		1																					
756	3	When riding a bike it @MONTH1 not seem to hard. For a cyclist every thing becomes more serious. The determination to win and be the best even if it kills you. In this essay he under estimates the dder cyclist. When really they are the people with more knowledge. Some of the things that @MONTH1 be hard for cyclist are the rough roads. Not only having a chance to be killed of dehydration or being ran over. Riding bike is really hard work when having to ride in hundred degree weather. Drinking drink after drink never having any water. No water and it being so hot could cause a heat stroke. As road get worse chances get higher tumble weeds and snakes in the way, he was determined to win. After all was said and he faced the horror that nature brought him he knew he was wrong wrong for them and the intelligants.	2	3		3																					
762	3	Early in the morning, the cyclist is eager and ready to face the adventurous path that had been mapped out by the older travelers. He hardly noticed the �sun was beginning to beat down.� He was calm and was looking forward to the �cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� Never once did he imagine what he had gotten himself into. As he began to approach the desert, he noticed he was running low on water. The strenuous activity of biking combine d with the scorching heat of the desert began to take effect. The cyclist was so desperate for water that he had to put pebbles into his mouth. He had once read, �that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate.� The cyclist was hoping for a way out of the misery he had come across. Dehydration took it�s toll, and he felt hallucinations. He was beginning to lose hope. The heat and the hills and the lack of water had the greatest affect on the cyclist. Had he not been riding through a hilly desert one afternoon in June, he would have been fine.	3	2		3																					
766	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed limit the cyclist expirenced a few life threating times during his adventure. The first feature was when was in a deseret with temptures of @NUM1 degrees and his lit bit of water tasted like battery acid. As he tried to keep going he lost hope and thought he was going to die. This affected him because as he lost hope he thought more negative about things and didn�t think he would make it but the he got the agility to move on. In this story the setting affects the characters dramatically.	2	2		2																					
767	3	The feature of the setting is making the cyclist frustrated, thirsty, and confused. The features are making him frustrated by he thought he was going the right way where he really was going out.	1	1		1																					
771	3	This paragraph tells about how careful you should be on the roads.This also talks about what you have to be aware of.There so many things that could happen.You have to take control when your on the road.	1	1		1																					
776	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist greatly. There were hills and rocks, snakes and no buildings or people. The hills and rocks would make it much harder to to stay strong and be able to keep riding. The abandoned building and there being no people, could affect him emotionally. It would make him loose hope and the determination to keep going to find destination. He did not think he would get that after seeing a deserted town. After all, he did say, �It didn�t really matter. I was going to die � �(Kurmaskie).	3	2		3																					
781	3	�At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path..� being out in the desert with limited or no water can make one feel like life is very cruel. The sun was beating down and no water or shade is seen when he reaches a point. The sign that said �Rough @CAPS1 ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� had to be intimidating. Considering he was on a bike he could only move so fast. Those old men probably were never off their front porch since carter was in office. yes like the writer said �the world is a fluid place.  Things  change.� The old men probably had close to no due what they were talking about considering things have changed since @NUM1 (when carter was in office). The snake that he came upon, must have been rather intimidating. Knowing there is a creature like that, there is bound to be more. In eseance I think the setting was a major part why the cyclist felt that way	3	2		3																					
786	3	Many features of the setting of the cyclist�s excruciating trip affect him mentally and physically. When he first sets out, the pine trees and rivers kept him cheerfully riding through the landscape. When he sees the corral and the rusty pumps, he becomes discouraged and begins to notice his tiredness and thirst. When the cyclist encounters a rough terrain with tumble weeds and snakes, he is both mentally and physically exhausted. He begins to doubt his consciousness and worries that he @MONTH1 not complete the journey. The abandoned grape juice factory is also a let  down for the cyclist�s mental state. When all hope is seemingly lost, he finally comes across water, and his unique (but very important) lesson is learned.	2	3		3																					
787	3	The features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. I know this because in the story the cyclist said that he was �going to drop from heat exsostion�, he is riding through the desert in @DATE1, and he took directions from three old �gentlemen� sitting on a porch.	1	1		1																					
792	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s essay �Rough Road Ahead,� the speaker is biking through some rough terrain in blistering heat, not to mention long distances. He has to ride up and down small and large hills through what he believes is a shortcut to his destination. He has a limited water supply, and he keeps coming cross ghost towns, where the only water is boiling brackish water that is unfit for human consumption. Probably the worst setting feature for this guy as the Welch�s Grape Juice Factory (abandoned of course). Adding salt to the wound was �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen� (kurmaskie @NUM1). To the narrator with his dwindling water supply, this billboard was especially daunting to him on his journey.	2	2		2																					
794	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. The winding road could affect his turns because he could turn to far one way and fall off his bike and get hurt real bad. Another feature that could affect the cyclist is grass on both sides of the road. If he tireds to take a short-cut and goes into the grass he could he could hit a rock and flip off his bike and get hurt. That is what the feature of the setting could affect the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
799	3	In this @ORGANIZATION1 I will explain how the features of the setting affected the cyclist. In the short story �Rough Road A Head Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� The whole ordeal occurs in the �high deserts of california.� @CAPS1 to the text the cyclist had taken �out of date� direction from elderly people who thought they new the way. The cyclist encountered a snake, ghost town ad shutdown factory. Most of the time the cyclist was going over.	1	1		1																					
800	3	The setting in  �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� adds drama into the story by how it affects the cyclist. He was tacking through the �high desert of California in June�. June is a hot part of the year and since he was in the hottest desert part the hot was multiplied. The terrain changing into �short rolling hills� didn�t help the cyclist. The hills would make any riding more difficult. Anyone who ride a bicycle knows it takes more effort to go up a hill than on a flat pavement. With the person lack of water anyone would be struggling to keep riding on. Most people didn�t have that hints to keep moving. He didn�t set a very goal he just went to the �next Horizon�. Shouldn�t he just wanted to keep going. Another problem with the physical environment was the road conditions. When the �Rough Road Affect� sign appeared the travel then become more difficult. A bike tire take more effort to go over uneven pavement is why the cyclist had so much trouble.	3	3		3																					
803	3	The feature of the setting affects the cyclist because the features is just a brief preview of what the text is going to be about or who is involved in it. The cyclist gives you what you want and need to know so the affect would be about time the feature is finish play in noone would want to see the cyclist.	0	0		0																					
805	3	The cyclist choose the worst time to ride his it was an �early summer evening� in California. At this time the sun is hot and with little water and also lost, it was hot the best choice that he made. A cyclist before do a trip he or she should be prepared for whether conditions and also check a map of the place before going anywhere. 	1	1		1																					
807	3	The features of this particular setting affected the cyclist in many different ways. Upon arriving at the �ghost town� early in his journey, he felt slight amusement at the situation. But he soon became very troubled when he became aware of the several rusty pumps and a weak corral, next to a ramshackle shed. The cyclist additionally experienced a bit of irony as he approached the 55 mph speed limit sign complete with a warning to strictly obey it. On his bicycle, at a pace of 12 mph, he could not even reach the 55 mph speed if he had wanted to. Before he reached what appeared to be an abandoned welch�s Grape Juice factory, the cyclist felt this twisted amusement yet again, as he laughed. The text states, �It was a sad hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself.� @CAPS1, his suffering was through when he discovered a �fish camp,� with a modern bathroom and working sinks. The cyclist�s relief was so immense that he,� had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber (the owners), (and) kiss them.	1	1		1																					
809	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he first didn�t know where he was going and took directions from people that he wasn�t really sure about. It was hot he was running out of water he had no idea where he was there were snakes. His water was running out. there were no sings he kept thinking that he would never take directions from an old guys and that he would stick to the future.	1	1		1																					
811	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit, the setting seemed to affect the main character (the cyclist) very much during his pedal, for example, whole the dry desert setting made him think that he could survive with out water, he became dehydrated. The first town, with @NUM1 degree watter could not satisfy his standards. The old velches June factory, was all run down, and is no longer in business, much like the desert, just old barren unuseland. While yes the cycalist survived the pedal, the desert setting opposed a great challenge for him. 	2	2		2																					
818	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they caused him to need water. He was worn out because the setting was so intense. �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� This quote from the text shows that the cyclists terrain was changing and they affected him.	2	2		2																					
819	3	The features of the surrounding landscape affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. First, the sun constantly beating down on the cyclist causes his or her body to sweat more, which makes one�s body use more energy. The sun rays also add to the heat the cyclist feels. Also, the rough road forces the cyclist to pedal very hard, which drains him or her of even more energy. For example, when the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� reached the rough roads, he had to pedal harder, which made him sweat more, and caused his amount of energy to decrease. Finally, the lack of civilization can make a cyclist feel hopeless, which is how the cyclist in the essay felt when he had no water or could see no nearby town. This can affect the cyclist�s will to keep pedaling, and if they have no determination, the cyclist will not go anywhere. The features of the setting can physically exhaust and mentally strain the cyclist, which makes it harder for him or her to keep going	3	2		3																					
821	3	"The setting acts as a catylist in this story. It is the aspect of the story that is always challenging the character untill the very end. In the story it says �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is showing that the terrain is opposing him. Also in the story it says �The speed limit was 55. I was doing a water depleted 12 mph. Sometimes life can be so cool.� This is not only showing how much the elements are owning him it also shows how is risle he is, and how satiricle life can be. The ultimate @CAPS1 in this story is when he stumbels across the welches grape juice factory and there was a piture of a boy ""pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth.� No matter where the cycalist goes he is alway trying to overcome the elements."	2	3		3																					
826	3	The features of a setting could be a number of different things. It could be snowing and cold, raining and of course wet, hot and dry, breezy and humid. The features could be a busy tough or a solitere country road, there could be rough terrain or straight aways. The setting of a place puts pressure of the reality of what will happen on a cyclist. In the essay a young cyclist takes advice from some elderly man and ends up riding through hot sun and ghost towns not knowing if he would survive. The heat had him feeling as though death were coming on him and the thirst had him becoming more determined to get to the next town so he could survive. If the features of the setting had been different, say he was riding on a flat road in a busy town with a breeze and places to stop for water everywhere he would not have feared for his life. The features of the setting affect how the cyclist feels and thinks. He can feel angry, happy, sad or scared and he can start to think about his own death. These have been what I believe some of the effects settings have on cyclist.	2	3		3																					
828	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the person who rode the  bike was very tired his legs and body needed a rest after riding on his bike for @NUM1 miles into the pedal. Also it effected the cyclist because of all the riding he had to do struggleing to get where he was trying to get but he was a strong man and he was willing to finish his forty miles of pedaling. He was also restless but he did it.	1	1		1																					
829	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in, �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� because it goes to many different terrains. The cyclist starts at a town and his working his way to Yosemite when he decides to listen to a group of old men. He started out strong until he got to the first town, which was totally abandoned. He kept going to another abandoned town. He decided to keep going until he saw a sign. The terrain was a lot diffrent with rolling hills and tumbleweed rolling by and a snake. Through listening to the old men the cyclist almost died from the threatening heat and lack of water. The setting affected the cyclist even more seriously than he could have imagined.	1	1		1																					
837	3	Many of the settings features affect the cyclist. One of the features of the dessert like, which is the setting, is the dry air and hot temperatures. This heat made it had for the cyclist to keep going, with despair the author says, �I was going to die and the birds world pick me clean.� @CAPS1 feature of the setting was the desolet towns that didn�t contain any water. This lack of the water made it horrible for him to continue on. The thirst was so bad that he had to put pebbles in his mouth to sucking on stones helps take your and off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulates. @CAPS1 features of the setting that affected the cyclist was the abandoned Welch�s Grape factory. This  factory gave the cyclist false hope because it would have been so great to have some grape juice during his thirst stricken state. The narrator called the factory.�Ironic  twist.�	3	3		3																					
849	3	The features of the setting could affect this cyclist. In this case it do effect the cyclist. According to the text �Sometimes life can feel so cruel.� This is a good example because he knew that this road was going to be rough and he was only going 12 mph. So the features of the setting did effect the cyclist. 	1	1		1																					
850	3	"The features of the setting affected the cyclist very much in this. The hot weather made him have a dry mouth leading to the lack of water. He used stones in his mouth and he said, �I�d read once that sucking of stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate."" He used that to help him survive the ordeal."	1	1		1																					
853	3	In the short story, Do Not exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting effects the cyclist in the story. For example, the dry hot air begins to  slowly dehidrate him, causing the cyclist to lose all sense of reason, the heat also played tricks on his mind. Also, the rolling hills exhausted him from working to cycle up them. This, also with the heat factor, caused him to use up his much needed water supply. The setting in this story deeply effects the cyclist. 	2	2		2																					
855	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist, because there is poisonous snake out thre. Your the only person ridin dow those hills all by your self. The guy had said that the next town was @NUM1 miles from where he was at. The lack of water that there were not any streams or rivers around there just in a desert with nothing.	1	1		1																					
858	3	The cyclist in the story is running into a lot of problems in this story. For example, the cyclist is out in the summer heat in California riding a bike. After several minutes of this, you will become thirsty. The cyclist brought water but after constant sweating the water supply has nearly ran out. Not having enough water can cause a person to become deyhdrated which then can cause them to pass-out and possibly die. So as you can see, the cyclist is affected by the setting in the story. He has been affected negatively by the heat and by the lack of water.	1	1		1																					
863	3	Many features of the setting affect the cyclist. The speed limit sign makes him feel like life is cruel. His first glimpse of the welch's Juice factory makes him feel excited. Meeting the deserted fork in the road makes him feel troubled. When he finally gets there, he feels relieved. These are all examples showing that features of the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
870	3	In the essay, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting greatly affected the cyclist. In this story, the cyclist is heading for Yosemite National Park, thinking it wise, he accepts directions from a group of eccentric old men. He begins his journey confidently on flat terrain and with a large supply of water. The first of three promised towns had been resigned to that of a ghost town. The second offered only water that slightly resembled battery acid. The cyclist soon becomes exhausted from lack of water and having to cross the now hilly terrain. He barely makes it to the third town to realize that the juice factory was out of business. The cyclist becomes sure that he is going to die of lack of water when he stumbles across a bait store. If it hadn�t been so hot, if the �towns� along the way had offered better resources and if the terrain hadn�t been so hilly, the cyclist would have had a very enjoyable ride. All of the affore mentioned factors of the setting greatly affected the cyclist.	3	3		3																					
872	3	The setting for the cyclist is a hard and dangerous one. He had little water, and his area had tough terrains. �I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM1). He is dehydrated and he still has a long way to go. I went on a bike ride that was many miles long  in @LOCATION2, and we did not have water because we could not take a break. The terrain was tough, just like the author�s terrain. The camel he was in was affecting his brain, and he just wanted to get it over with. I am just glad I don�t have to bike in that terrain.  	2	1		2																					
876	3	The features of the setting put an affect on the cyclist. The first thing would be listening to old men who seemed like they had no idea how far, long, or the condition of the roads where they were sending him. Another thing that affected him would be the road condition, where there were tumbleweeds, and a ridiculously large snake. The second thing that came into play would be the hot weather which made dehydration come into play.	2	2		2																					
882	3	In the story it explained the beauty of the night, also about the outdoors and how it is effecting his trip. The features of the setting effects the cyclist, because the setting was mild, sounded warm and calm. Also it showed how it contains to us. The setting was similar to the cyclist. That�s how the features of the setting effects the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
885	3	In the setting of Do Not Exceed Posted Speed  Limit, is riding a bike really fast on a rough road.	0	0		0																					
888	3	The setting affects the cyclists because he can not take the heat. His water supply is running how and he is dehydrated. It says this when the characters says. �The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide wings of sweat circled my shirt and the growing realization that I could drop from head strok� This is saying he is afraid he might pass out and die before he finds more water.	2	1		2																					
891	3	Hot, alone, no water � all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist. It is very hot as the cyclist is riding. This makes the cyclist feel worried about getting dehydrated. The cyclist is alone and there is nothing in sight. If anything happened to him there is no one to help. The cyclist had very little water and had to conserve it in order too stay active and have energy. With very little water it is hard to stay hydrated. Hot, alone, no water- all are reasons why the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
893	3	"The setting in the essay ""Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit"" has a major effect on the cyclist. The setting is the high deserts of California"" where it is June and very hot. The path of the cyclist suggested by some old men makes the heat even worse because there are no people or water in sight. In the essay, the cyclist starts out the day confident and excited for his ride to Yosemite National Park. His mood changes throughout the day as after @NUM1 miles he arrives in a ""ghost town"" the old men led him to believe would be a settled town where he could get more supplies and cool off. Soon as the temperature rises to what feels like ""two hundred degrees"" the cyclist begins to run low on water and feels ""sometimes life can feel so cruel."" The heat and lack of people and water lead the cyclist to desperation and make him feel like as he says ""i was going todie."" The setting of the cyclists journey provides the mood of hopelessness and amplifies the feeling of determination felt by the cyclist to keep going at all costs because he was going to die if he stopped. The author, @PERSON1 uses the setting of the essay to help bring across his mesage that by blindly trustting people instead of trusting yourself things could end up being hard for you to overcome..       "	3	3		3																					
900	3	In the story, the rider faced several meloncholy sites. For examples the �ghost town� that he ran into at first really put a load on him because he had no one to ask for futher directions or somewhere to freshen up. Futher on down the road the hill he came up on was a physical obsticle that he had to go over. With the sun beating on his back and the emptiness of the road he might have begin to want to turn back. He kept on persaveering which was how he made it down. The lack of water also mad it difficult for him. Traveling with his water running out and beginning to feel sick did not go well with him.	3	2		3																					
901	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in a negative way. For example, A tarlike substance oozed followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees."" This affects him because cant get water from the well. So this means he needs water, but cannot get water. Also in the essay it says the terrain is bad so that means that the cyclist has to pedal harder to keep moving and he has to work harder to hot reek. So all this puts affect on him from just whats around him. The old abbandon factory with the boy drinking juice was had the  most effect on the cyclist because he was so thirsty and that was when he was about to give up. In this essay the setting had alot of affect on the cyclist to were he thought he might die."	2	2		2																					
902	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. The speaker tells us that he�s riding his bike in the middle of the desert in June. This shows the author is probably very hot. The author tells us that the road turned into hills and bumps. This would make it more difficult for the author because he would have to use more energy to move up the hill. And lastly, the cyclist tells us that the �towns� he came to were abandoned and uncared for. This would not be good for the cyclist because he would be able to get water for his trip.	2	2		2																					
903	3	The @CAPS1 is affected in many ways. The major thing that effects him is the lack of water. Throughout the story he mentions the lack of water. He also continues to say to himself he should not have took that route. For example, �I could drop from a heatstroke on a gorgeous day in june because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off thire porch in decades, caused me to laugh.� The @CAPS1 says things about the older gentle man throughout the story.	2	2		2																					
905	3	The features in the setting of the essay affected the author greatly. The Hills, on a hot day, with no water, or nearby town is really rough, expecially if you�ve been riding for more than @NUM1 miles. The environment of the hot June weather near a dessert area can cause serious problems, for example heat stroke and since he had no water to drink dehydration caused a lot of fear in the author. The setting of the essay and the conditions the author were under were extreamly dangerous and hes lucky he made it out alive.	2	2		2																					
908	3	 I think the features of the settings affect the cyclist because the knowledge of the cyclist is limited example, �old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office�, meaning now its time for the older people to relax and watch of younger people.	1	1		1																					
911	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist mood and behavior. First the cyclist sees from believing the shortcut will help him arrive to Yosemite faster then he relies it wont. Next, the harsh sun and rafh terrain and lack of water causes the cyclist to give up hope that he will make it to yosemite and causes him to rethink his judgement and taking advice from others.	1	2		2																					
915	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the cyclist, on his way to Yosemite National Park, is forced to face the rough deserts of California. As is normal throughout all deserts, the sun is blazing hot, as is the sand. There is no water anywhere and dangerous, highly venomous creatures are abundant. The lack of water almost puts him into a heat stroke as he is determined to leave the desert, riding his bike all alone. A grope juice factory taunts him, mocks him, but he continues on, with a steady pace. The desert roads are rocky and bumpy and his lousy 12 mph speed is getting him practically nowhere. Until, finally, he reaches a modern area and drinks from the sink in the bathroom.	2	2		2																					
917	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist, by putting him in unwanted places starting off with this man took advice from many older men, which don�t even know the area anymore. So riding through this man seems lost, he is trying to follow their advice, but comes across many unknown, unwanted areas. He starts out good, then comes to a �Rough Road� and he even says �sometimes life can feel so cruel�. Then he come to this large snake in the middle of the road scary enogth he has to slow ride past this thing taking up most of the road. Coming over these thing was very strong and hard of this young man.	2	3		3																					
933	3	The cyclist had a hard trail to bike in order to get to @LOCATION1. It is easy to bike if you are on flat smoot terrain, when you get to rolling hills, it makes it a lot tougher. The biker said �I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. It was also very hot. he was sweating and getting dehydrated, �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind of thirst.� he had eighteen miles to next town without much water. The first deserted town didn�t have any drinkable water. It was very hard to bike in these conditions, and is important to always be prepared and know were you are going.	2	2		2																					
937	3	In the essay �Rough road ahead: do not exeed posted speed limit,� the author is continually depressed, by the features of the landscape he passes. At first he passes a ghost town, but because he has enough water, this sight doesn�t bothe him. But the next thing he sees is a rundown old shed and a �rusted water pump,� and this troubles him because he is running out of water. Then he sees a huge snake which does not help his mood, because the snake is blocking his path then he passes an abandoned Welch�s Grape Juice factory and despairs that he will never find water. The setting its features serve to dissappoint depress the cyclist in his quest to find water.	3	2		3																					
939	3	At First the narrator in Do not Exceed  Posted Speed limit was energetic enthusiastic  about their journey to Yosemite national Park .After getting some helpful advice about a few short cuts the cyclist sets out for adventure .First thing they encounter is ghost town .The gentlemen they a taken advice from had assured them it was booming prosperous town .This set the first wave of doubt through the cyclist mind .Then lack of water began .They were travelling through the high desserts of California in June and slowly running out of water .Flat road was soon replaced by short , rolling hills which only increased the cyclist state deliriousness .After a few more dissapointments the cyclist decides there is no hope and they are going to die .The reader is partly drawn in believing that this is the end for the cyclist .All of the disappointments set the stage for the end of the cyclist and you can�t stop reading because you have to find out what happens.If it weren�t for the hopelessness of the setting you wouldn�t care.	3	2		3																					
940	3	When the cyclist is going on his trip, he is riding through as desert. All he sees the entire journey is a flat rode and dirt. He is riding on the road; hopelssly hoping for some form of lif. �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. �The author is trying to be positive but it�s hard, because all this scenery is doing is bringing his hopes down. How would you like it if you were riding a bike and had no water in the middle of a desert. Now, if the setting had been a nice, green forest, he wouldn�t be that worried, there�s water and shade. He has none of that in the desert. This whole journey was all mental. He always kept in his mind that everything would be ok. That is what helped him survive. This is an ispiring story, to anyone who needs a push to stey optionistic.	2	2		2																					
944	3	"The features of the setting in the story affect the cyclist both physically and mentally. It affects him physically because of the rolling hills he has to trudge over and the lack of water he has. The rolling hills make him tired and weak along with the rough terrain. The lack of water doesn�t help any when he�s thirsty because of the hills. The features affect him mentally because the farther he goes the more dalerious he gets. Each more mile he keeps telling himself, if I can just get there I�ll be fine. He also blames himself for listening to the old men. And with this also came doubt. He was doubting that he could make it alive. In the story it says, �it didn�t really matter: I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean"". mentally he couldn�t make it."	2	2		2																					
945	3	When the rider was riding his bike in such day settings has started to need water he was running out, So his whole adventure was to find water. Being thirsty was very hard because it made him not want to keep going because he was so tired. It made him harder on him. But it also got him more strength and because in himself, and keep on pushing. 	1	1		1																					
947	3	"The features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. For example, the story said,""I gathered up a few pebbles and stock them in my mouth"" This quote explains that the setting was very and had pebbles. The setting benefiting him by taking the thrist off his mind. If their wasn't any pebbles by the cyclist he @MONTH1 not have made it. In cocnlusion in the story Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit the cyclist was benefited by the features of the setting."	1	1		1																					
953	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they started to mess with her mind. She didn�t knew where she was and on hip of that got lost. Whether you see nothing around. You or alot around you, you�re going to feel scared. They have the same affect. In the authors case, she was cycling and didn�t/couldn�t and water. This is an over whelming feeling because you can die from dehydration. She then kept cycling and saw nothing. �no one insight; not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� That is alatining no water or people around, as if you are going to be just left to die. These settings would affect anyone who came across them. They dffinately affected the cyclist because she was by herself, and on her dvun. Plus, all she had was a map, her bike and an empty water bottle.	3	2		3																					
960	3	The features of the setting in �Rough Road:Do Not Exceed the Posted Speed Limit�by Joe kurmaskie affects the cyclist in a very negative way.It begins slowly with the �ghost town�.The narrorator �chuckled, checked my water supply and moved on,� he wasn�t especially worried,but the fact he checked his water suggests that he�ll need to ration it for a while.The decline continues when he reaches the fock and the �ramshackle shed.�@CAPS1 the description of the place shows you he did not like it,and he confirms that with the words,�this sight was troubling.�He wouldn�t be replenishing his water here.Any more of this he�d be dead,either from dehydration or from pessimism.Eventually he reached the road sign which declared that going over 55 mph was a bad idea.This is ironics,he only going 12 mph to put it in his own words,�sometimes life can be so cruel.�He quite obviously hates the setting,and it�s all the fault of the setting.	3	2		3																					
966	3	"The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit definitely affected the author. The cyclist states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The cyclist probably found it more difficult to navigate  through the ""hills"" as opposed to the ""Flat roads,"" making him more quickly tired. The speaker states, �I could drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie @NUM2). The speaker is implying that it is so hot outside that he could faint from a �heatstroke� which could slow him down. The speaker also states,""water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees""(Kurmaskie @NUM3). The author did not have any good water to drink, because it was so hot outside, which affected him in that he was dehydrated. Many aspects of the setting affected the cyclist.  "	3	2		3																					
968	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist by the road�s condition being rough as the cyclist rides further along the road.	1	1		1																					
970	3	The features affect the cyclist in many ways. For example the road, the rocks everything close. The cyclist needs to know everything about where he's going, because if not then he can run into some problems along the way, For example like snakes, rough terrain, rocks in the way. That why its important for a cyclist to never listen to anyone but themselves. That why when you see cyclist you see them around, a road where theres cars around, just in case they get into trouble.	1	1		1																					
972	3	At times when the features of the setting are bad it can have a great impact on the cyclist. For one if it�s too hot the cyclist is going to need plenty of water if he/she does'nt want to be dehydrated. There are also the dangers of heat strokes and deadly snakes, cyclist might want to avoid that. When your a cyclist times can be hard just prepared for the long run.	1	1		1																					
974	3	During this essay the author is talking about his journey	1	1		1																					
979	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. Three features I found were the lack of the water, the heat and the conditions and limits of the road. The lack of water really affected the cyclist. When he was died tried he/she didn�t have anything to drink. The essay stated how would say she/he would save the water til the end. He /she was so tired so the lack of water really affect him/her. The conditions he/she was in really affected the cyclist also. From the beginning he/she was told the wrong directions. That was the reason why he/she was lost the entire time. Finally the limits of the road affected the cyclist. Hills and different grounds did not help the cyclist. In conclusion, the cyclist had many factors affecting him such as lack of water, limits of the road and his/her conditions.	2	2		2																					
987	3	"In the essay �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� the setting effects the cyclist in many ways. When the cyclist arrived at the first town, he described it as a ghost town. This effected the cyclist because he started to have doubts about the directions he received, but he was looking foward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite so he persevered. The setting of the next land mark was similar to the last. There was a shed, a few rusty pipes and a corral that ""Couldn�t hold in the lamest mule.� This made the cyclist more werry of the path ahead because he was running out of water. The next place was also similar. There was an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The cyclist was running out of water and now thought he was going to die because everything was deserted. Then, finally, the setting changed. There was a store that was actually opened. The cyclist then felt happy and relieved. That is how the different settings effected the cyclist."	3	2		3																					
990	3	The cyclist was trying to make it to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was in Lodi, California when he decided to ask for directions from old codgers so that he could take a short cut. He followed their directions and little did he know that he should have stuck to his original directions. The cyclist was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. The cyclist became very hot and thirsty from traveling in the desert. It says in the text �when I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid� This shows that he had no water left to kept him dehydrated throughout his travel. Also in the text it says �with what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill� this shows that he had no energy left.	2	2		2																					
998	3	The futures of the setting affect the cyclist was that he show the maD to other people and he shouldn�t (ister) to others where he had it to go.	1	1		1																					
1002	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist on different occasions in different ways. For instance, when arriving at the first town, the author calls it your average ghost town but continues on with confidence. The next building he saw was an abondoned Welch�s Juice bottle factory, on the building was a singn with a boy drinking a cold glass of juice. This intimidates the reacher the begins to question the wisdom of the old men. Continuing on he reaches another building. To his relief its a bolt shop that was still in business. He goes to the sink immediately to drink the water at this point he is relieved to have water $ be near civilization instead of in dessert without a sight of liFe or building. Therefore his surrouding throughout the story make him indifferent, confident & relieved.   	3	2		3																					
1012	3	In Joe Kurmaskie�s, �Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� there are several features that effect the cyclist. �..and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June� (Kurmaskie) Deserts in June are extremely hot and dry and caused the cylist to become dehydrated quickly. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills.� The change from flat lands to hills made the ride more strenuous on the cyclist. These conditions directly affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1013	3	The cyclist was trying to get to Yosemite National Park. The cyclist was riding through the deserts in June. The cyclist barely had water at the end of the stony. A lot of buidings were abandoned, right when he needed water. That is how the setting affected him.	1	1		1																					
1019	3	All the features of the settings affect his rythm, determination and will to win because it sets him off his goal a little bit when he should just try to ignore stuff the best as he can. Instead of thinking about it. If I was him I would just ride my bike & think about I thing winning!	1	1		1																					
1034	3	The setting of �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� was very hot deserts. On a bike ride there are not many places to stop for food or water. On a bike ride you cant bring a lot of louage with you. Only important materials and a big enough jug of water. An example from the text to show how bad it was out there. �I got down on my hands, and knees, working,the handle of the rusted pump with all my strength. He was so thirst and tired he didn�t know how else to get some water	1	1		1																					
1042	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist is many different ways. One way is the hilly terrain makes him work harder and wears him out. Since the cyclist is getting worn out he needs to drink more and more water. Now that he�s drinking more water his running out of it faster and wanting more and more of it. Then when he starts to use less water to conserve it until he gets to the next town he starts to become dehydrated and more tired and he starts to feel weak. Also because the terrain is hilly his legs are working harder to go up the hills and his legs become tired. It also starts to get hotter and he gets thirsty more often. That is how the setting affects the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1046	3	The setting in the essay �Rough Road Ahead� makes the bikers travel a very difficult challenge that he has to overcome. When the �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� the biker must use more energy to peddl up the hills. This made it hard on him to overcome his exauhtion of physical endurance. Also, he states that he was �traveling through the high desert of California in June� this weather is very hot and dry, therefor causing him to quickly run low on water. And, because he was in the desert, there was no sign of towns or people or salvation of any type. These conditions made it hard on the biker because he knew if he dropped from dehydration, no one would be around to save him. In conclution, these hard conditions challenged the bike a great deal.	2	3		3																					
1047	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. The cyclist was on a very long bike ride to Yosemite National Park. However, on the way there, he had to cross through a desert like terrain. The blistering sun had been beating on his back for many miles. All the heat built up a desire for him to get water. He had been very tired. The terrain had made him drenched in sweat. If it wasn�t so hot, then he wouldn�t of had that much of a hard time. The desert contains a very high temperature, which makes it harder to endure physical activities. Even if you are to have a high endurance. The heat will make you very tired, and you will lose a lot of energy. Also, it didn�t help anything, that the elderly men, had gave him terrible directions. That is why I think the setting affected the cyclist.	2	3		3																					
1051	3	The feature effect the cyclist because he wants to go somewhere spectaculiar and amazing like. Like for example, he said he was thriving on this one spot forever and he finally got their and it was a ghost town and he chuckeled and roud away because it wasn�t what he was looking for. I belive that this guy in judging every place he goes by the way it looks and not by what it haves to offer like he doesn't believe in getting direction from an old mat, but yet he still took it. I believe that he wants to get were he wants to go and not let anybody get in his way no matter what it's like he is looking for a perfect spot and he think want he finds it he will be filled with story.	1	1		1																					
1062	3	The setting affects the cyclist in a very negative way due to the lack of buildings, people, and cars on his �shortcut� he was in great doubt of his survival. �I was going to die, and the birds would pick me clean.� He thought he wouldn�t get any water because there was nothing around him and he thought he would die of dehydration or heatstroke. �And the growing realization that I would die of heatstroke.�	2	2		2																					
1064	3	The setting affected the cyclist because it was in June and it was starting to get hot. In the book, it said he was going through the desert. Also, the author did not have enough water to survive in the desert while the sun was beaming on him.	1	1		1																					
1067	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because if is very hot and is summertime. The cyclist wouldn�t have gotten so tired and exhausted if he wasn�t in a �ghost town�, with the, �sun beggining to beat down�. It was in @CAPS1 for nia during June so it was. Very hot, the water was also @NUM1 degrees! The text as states there were rolling hills and tumble weeds, so it must have been a desert kind of area. The trip was also a very long one, �about forty miles into the petal�, causing him to be tired. As you can see the setting was an area with no people, and it was very hot.	2	2		2																					
1073	3	The hot, dry, desert setting affects the cyclist in many different ways, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June� (@NUM1). The cyclist is very hot. He was thirsty but, �A tarlike substance ooted out, followed by brakish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of zoo (@NUM2). The water was barely even water, so he didn�t have much to drink until the next town. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling  hills� (@NUM3). Flat road is much easier to bike on then hills. He was thirstier and more tired after biking on hills �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could still be seen� (@NUM4) on an old welchs grape fruit factory. This makes the cyclist envicus of the young boy. It also discourages him. In conclusion, the water being bad, the terrain change. the picture of the young boy, and the fact that the cyclist drinks a lot makes him tired, hot, envious, and generally exausted.	3	2		3																					
1078	3	"Features of the setting affected the cyclist in many different ways.for example, he ask the older guts, ""that haven't left rheir porches since carter was in the office where the next placewas to get water. Also he was out in the middle of nowhere. It was also in June were the weather was warm,and he didn't have a lot of water."	1	1		1																					
1084	3	The desert area of California was makeing him dehydrated. The trip was long but he had enough water to get him there only if he took the maps way. The old men thot �haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office� told him a shortcut that he followed and ended up almost killing him due to heat stroke and dehydration. If the cyclist would have followed the map he could have stoped off at a store for more water if the setting was that bad.	1	1		1																					
1085	3	The features of the setting  affect the cyclist in many ways. The setting was a dry California desert, for if it had been a busting city, the events in the story would have not happened. The author asked a group of old men for directions to Yosemite National Park, and , �like a foolish yuuth,� folluwed their advice. Everything started out fine until he reached the second town. He �ans almost dehydrated and �in an ironic twist� he reached on abandoned grape juice foctary. Almost all hope was lost for him until he rounded the bend and came across his new hope: �Gary and Wilber�s Fish camp-if you wont bait pur the big ones, we�re your best bet � in He end he learned tostick to a map instead of old people who �haven�t left the confines of their purchess,hce carter was ,h office�	3	3		3																					
1092	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist on how the nature of life he was hydrated or not. On the posts �Do not exceed posted speed limit �is after �wide rings of dried sweat clinched my thirst, and the growing realization that I could drop from heat stroke on a gorgeous day in June�. This shows that he is dehydrated from the sun which is a feature of the setting. �a tarlike distance surged out, followed by cockish water feeling somelane in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees.� Cyclist know that there is no water in this place which is another feature of the setting which affects the cyclist.  	2	1		2																					
1094	3	The setting where the cyclist is at is in a desert, and it can affect him because, he could get a heatstroke. The text states that he is lacking water and if you get too dehygrated it's not healthy and you die from it. However, when the wind is against his face, it can cool him down,along with the sweat. As long as he has some lijid left, it should be ohang. 	1	1		1																					
1100	3	"The setting affected the character in ways that would usually affect people. When he got into the first town he had ran out of water to drink but the towns water he was in now tasted like battery acid so that�s not safe to drink. As he started to head out the scenery changed. �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills."" This is hinting at the fact that maybe this town he is going to @MONTH1 be abandoned or not used. He saw a huge rattle snake and tumbleweed. Which are usual signs of a desert. It was hard for him to keep his balance as he says, �trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state.� He ended up getting to the point where he had to put rocks in his mouth to trick his mind that he wasnt thirsty anymore."	2	2		2																					
1109	3	"People who travel will almost always encounter difficulties. For the main character in this story, thus a very true. His first mistake was when he took directions from the �old-timers� by doing that, he travelled extremely far out of his way. In the story he talked to the old men on the porch. He said, �what I shouldn�t have done was to let them see my map"".  Another problem he faced was when he began to run out of water.  This caused a problem to him because of dehydration. In the story he said, �The water bottle contained any a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, another problem he encountered was the desert area that he was riding through. This caused problem for him because there wasn�t anybody around to help him if he needed it. In the story he says, �There was no one in sight, not a building, cars, or structure of any kind.� By reading this story, we�ve realized that people encounter problems everywhere, however any problem, no matter what size, can be overcomed"	1	1		1																					
1113	3	In the story the Features of the setting affects the cyclist is that when he is riding he has very little water. Also he takes advise from old men and he meets up with an @CAPS1 Snake and he goes down an dirt Road he has no water at the time there. The conclusion is that he comes of the dirt Road and @CAPS2 the main Road that he travels. Also he promised to stick to it in the @CAPS3. That is how you should stick things at in the future.	1	1		1																					
1120	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it is in the desert it is in the summer. It affect the cyclist because he is riding a bike. For exsempl in the story he is running out of water. He is starting to git dehyjradid.	1	1		1																					
1129	3	Features of any setting affect what you do and how you do it. Features affect the cyclist by water, help, and saftey. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirsty by allowing what spit you have to circulate.� This quote so his desperate need for water by saying he sucks a on rock to drink his own spit. The rough terrain and abandoned road the old men sent him on that was out of date, made him unable to ask for directions, and to even know if he is travelling correctly. Along the road he meets a snake. Being so far away from civilization, if he was to have gotten bit then he would have no one to help save him from dyeing on the side of the road. Also, if he was to have a heatstroke he has no water and no help. Safty, help, and water are all factors which contribute to the features, and how they effect the cyclist.   	1	1		1																					
1130	3	The features of the setting make the ride for the cyclist very hard. It has a lot of hills, which would make him use more energy. Also, it is a desert, so it is very hot and dry. This makes the author need more water than he normally would. The author said ��I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.� The author knew that it was very dangerous to travel there without water, he said ��I could drop from heatstroke�� If the setting had been cooler there would not be so much danger.	2	2		2																					
1132	3	The setting affects the cyclist because there were lots of hills and very little water.	1	1		1																					
1133	3	The cyclist in the story rough road ahead Do not exeed posted speed limit, by Joe kurmashie, is heavily affected by the features of the setting in the story. First is the �shorecay� that is suggested to get    to @CAPS1, which naturally just ends up separating him from all other people and putting him in the middle of nowhere with a limited supply of water. His water shortage is the second thing that affects him because it makes him despair and feel that he is about to collapse and die. In the story, he says: �It really didn�t matter. I was going to die and the lards would pick me clean.� This shows that the features at the setting made him feel hopeless.	2	2		2																					
1136	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affects the cyclist in many ways. One thing is the water. There is little water and it is boiling hot. He took some taste of it. He said �It tasted like battery acide.� To me if the water is hot don�t taste it. Another thing is the land. The land went from straight to hilly. That started slowing him down. Last, is the day time. It started turning dark and he was still biking. He wanted to get as far as he could.	3	2		3																					
1137	3	The features in the setting affected the cyclist when he got tired very easily because he was biking in the desert in June. There are no rivers in the that desert so he couldn�t get water. It is so hot out there that he couldn�t see very well because of all the sweat that went into his eyes. Also there are no people out there because of how hot it is.	1	1		1																					
1139	3	A cyclist always has to face many problems such as the weather, the condition of the road, etc.	1	1		1																					
1141	3	The featers of the setting afected the cyclist by the lack of water made him tiered and a bit deloshional. The lack of shade increased the rate of dehidrashion. The rough road made it hard to balinc. And the snack slowed him dowen. He thought that he was going to die.	1	2		2																					
1145	3	"In the essay ""Rough Road Ahead; Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,"" by Joe kurmaskie, the setting is integral to how the cyclist feels and behaves. The cyclist feels a growing desperation as the setting around him gets progressively move bleak. In the beginning of the trip, the cyclist encounters a ghost town. ""I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on."" The cyclist is still thinking positively at this point in the essay. A while later, the cyclist comes across another abandoned set of buildings. He feels that this sight is ""troubling."" @CAPS1 the cyclist is worried, he is not yet depressive and pessimistic. Farther down the road, the terrain of the road changes, and he sees the sign that gives the essay its name."" The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting @NUM1. Sometimes life�s can feel so cruel."" The cyclist�s surroundings get progressively worse as he rides on, but even tually he finds a place with working water. He is so overjoyed by this building that he wants to find the owners, and kiss them."	3	3		3																					
1151	3	The cyclist, Joe Kurmaskie, had a rough time traveling to Yosemite @ORGANIZATION1�l Park. Granted he was misled, but if the conditions of the terrain and if the climate were working for him it wouldve made life a whole lot easier. Not only was it hot, being in a desert in California in June, but he only had one water bottle. One water bottle @MONTH1 have lasted a little longer if it was a straight shot through, but it wasn�t. The roads went up, down, there were hills, there were towns-ghost towns at that. The only water he could pump from the pump was scalding hot and tasted acidic. Also, he wouldn�t have lost as much energy if it was a straight shot. It�s easy to say that he literally roughed it, having to resort to putting rocks in his mouth to circulate saliva. All in all, he was very determined to work through the very unfortunate conditions he had working against him, and very lucky to survive it. 	2	3		3																					
1153	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by lack of water, poisonous snake, the condition of the rode for example the lack of water affected the cyclist because he couldn't make it wi thout water he could of passed out if he didnt have water. Another example of how the setting affected the cyclist would be the poisonous snake if he would have  goten bitten he could have died cause there would be nobody to help him. And the last example of how the setting affected him would be the conditon of the road because it make it tougher for the cyclist to get to his destination with hills and windy rounds this is how I think the setting affected  the  cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1155	3	 The story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1 had some statements that we were kind of pointless to put in. One of sentence in the essay had a couple word that don�t need to be used. In the sentence, about forty miles into the pedal, I arrive at the first �town,� I don�t think �into the pedal needs to be in there because its not describing anything.	1	1		1																					
1157	3	The settings of the story is very desert like what I mean by that is its the desert and its hot and he really had to push his self to make it. The condition at the rode are very rough and has a lotof shape turn it in. Apart in the story he gets a boost of energy and pedal as hard as he can down a hill and then relaxes. This is the setting and is summary of the story.	0	0		0																					
1159	3	Features of the setting affect the cyclist in a great way His journey would not be as difficult if these factors had not crossed his path. Climate, location, and population all have an effect on the cyclist. In the story, it is told that the cyclist is in the dry climate in California, in the heat of June.Their is also a lack of water, some must pace his sips carefully. Therefore also few towns, making it hard to get good advice and supplies and supplies. The cyclsit also comes across a snake, making him affected by native wild life.  The dry climate and lack of water affects him by having doubt. The cyclist is constantly worried about passing out and dying of dehydration. The cyclist also gets doubts when he sees the road signs reminding him how slow he is going. The snake also has a depressing effect about his dangers on his journey. All of these things in the setting affected the cyclist. His journey does teach you though, that trough determination you will be rewarded. You have to want things bad enough and put the effort into it. The author also teaches you to always have a positive attitude to get success.	3	3		3																					
1163	3	The setting affects the cyclist because one he should have stack to his own map. He should have packed an extra bottle of water. @NUM1 not take any advice from people that haven�t left the porch in years.	2	1		2																					
1165	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclists because he was thirsty and it was hot and he was almost out of water and he almost died because when he was drinking the water and he hit a bump and spit got lodged in his throat and tiring hills it seemed to never end.	1	1		1																					
1193	3	The cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by @PERSON1 suffers from some hardship while riding through the desert. The features of the setting affected the cyclist by having no water to drink because it was a desert there was no vegetation that means there is no water so he was becoming dehydrated. Also the setting of the towns he went to had no living organisms or people so he also couldn�t quench his thirst there. In one town there was a spiket but the water was gross and hasn�t been pumped in a while. Then he comes to the Welch�s juice factory which was abandoned and from there he thought he was done for but then he finally come to a shop were there are bathrooms were he drinks water from the sink and he is relieved. Also the rocky roads affected him because he barely had any water left, and rocky tent to take more strength and endurance.	2	3		3																					
1196	3	In the story, �Do not exceed posted speed limit�, the setting affects the way that the cyclist rides. In this story, the setting is out in nowhere wit no water, and all he can see is roads. This affects the cyclist because he is hungry, thirsty,and now he's about to go down a really steep hill with fear of crashing and seriously insuring himself with noone around to get help from the setting of nowhere affects the cyclist in this story.	1	1		1																					
1199	3	In the essay intitled �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� It talks about a gentlemen who is riding a bike to �Yosemite� and he does not know exactly how to get there. So he stops and ask some old folks and he says �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porchers since Carter was in office.� @CAPS1 means they are not familiar with the changes. After he leaves the old-folks he continues on his long hot journey. He begins to run out of water and so he begins to panic. Next he comes to the sign that said �Rough	1	1		1																					
1201	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,� the features of the setting had an affect on the cyclist. The setting and the features affected him not only physically, but mentally as well. The setting caused him to doubt himself and the men and also it kept him from having the energy needed to get to where he was going. Where the cyclist was riding, in California, affected him physically. It was hot, and he had no watter. This caused him to become tired and frustrated. The setting affected him emotionally as well. He started off fine, but as he went on, and as the road slowly changed to hills, he began to get frustrated and angred that he listened to the men. As he saw no buildings in sight for many miles, he began to lose his determination as well as hope. Lastly, when he saw the sign �Gary and @CAPS1 Fish Camp� he started to regain hope and become less frustrated. The setting and features of the essay affected the cyclist not only physically, but mentally as well. He started of determined, then as the setting changed he became doubtful and frustrated. In the end, he turned out satisfied as the setting seemed more hopeful.	3	2		3																					
1204	3	In the essay �Do Not Exceed Speed Limit,� the features of the setting affected the cyclist in a few ways. One way it affected him was that the temperature was very hot and by it being hot outside his water wouldn�t stay cool. This is a problem because you need nice, cool, refreashing water to stay hydrated. Another way was when he hit a fork in the road. He didn�t know which way to go. All he saw was one ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold the lamest mule greeted me. The sight was troubling. Last but not least this water pump wasn�t working very well so he got down on his hands and knees and started pumping. The water wouldn�t cool down. He tried a drop or two and the water tasted like battery acid. Those are some features of the setting that affected the cyclist on his journey.	2	2		2																					
1208	3	According to the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit'' the features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. One way the features of the setting affects the cyclist is that the mountains make the cyclist more tired. Especially because he no water, then having to go up and down hills really wears the cyclist out and causing him to lead into dehydration faster. The features of the setting affected him in that sense. Also the snake affected the cyclist. The snake caused the cyclist to be afraid which added to the fact that the cyclist was dehydrating. Another way that the features of the setting affected the cyclist was the Welch's Grape Juice Factory. The factory caused the cyclist to be even more thirsty and think about dehydration even more in the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� the features of setting affect the cyclist a lot.	3	2		3																					
1210	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because it makes it hard for him to get to �@CAPS1 National Park�. He took advice from some old men to take a shortcut to get him where he wanted to be. On his ride there, he stopped at a �town�, which was, to him, considered a ghost town. Then he got to a Welch�s Grape Juice Factory, but it was abandoned years earlier and he was becoming weak and dehydrated. He thought he would drop from a heatstroke. At the end of his ride, he reached a fish camp where he found water to drink. A man asked him where he was going and the cyclist told him. Then the man asked him, �Know the best way to get there?� The man was much older than the other old men that gave the cyclist advice. So the cyclist told the man �yes, sir: I own a very good map�. The man realized throughout the setting on his journey, that he would never accept advice from old-timers again.	1	1		1																					
1218	3	The setting in the short story �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie is troubling to the cyclist �One ramshackleshed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the tamest mule greeted me,� made him troubled that he was in the middle of nowhere. The quote, �Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing, flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,� shows that he was troubled by having to go over the hills. As you can see the setting was very influental to the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1224	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist because they change the cyclist�s mood towards the rider. For example, in the essay �Rough Road Ahead;Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� it states, ""There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or sructure of any kind. I began breaking the ride clan into distances I could see on the horizon� The cyclist had to do this because they were having trouble riding since they were thirsty and the ride was very boring. This makes the ride seem larges so it also makes it harder to ride. Also in the essay it states, ""One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps� This affeted the cyclist because after seeing this and later realizing he could�t drink the water, he was more thirsty since he was running out of water. When the cyclist notices the Welch�s grape juice factory, he bacames determined to get there. In conclusion, the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road Ahead"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the cyclist mood towards the ride is strongly affected by the setting�s features."	3	2		3																					
1232	3	"The arid, bare, and rough terrain of the desert affected the cyclist during his journey to Yosemite in the story �Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit�. The cyclist�s expedition was hindered due to many obstacles. The dryness was a huge problem during his journey. �.I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This exert explain the hot, arid climate of where he was cycling. This climate decreased the rate of travel the cyclist intended to exert. Since the cyclist was riding in the desert, there wasn�t many towns present. When the cyclist did approach a town, it was abandoned. �One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn�t hold in the lamest mule greeted me� (@NUM2). After riding through the desert, the cyclist would have wanted a nice rest stop, but all of them were ghost towns. �Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills �(@NUM1). Cycling for hours in a hot desert with limited water wasn�t enough of a challenge; the flat land was replaced with hills. The cyclist is exhausted from all the other obstacles that the desert confronted him with; the rough terrain affected his journey since his rate was reduced. In conclusion, many factors negativly affected the cyclist expedition to Yosemite. The dry, bland, and hilly terrain of the desert hindered his journey"	3	2		3																					
1239	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because the rougher the terrain got the more the cyclist had to strain to make it. For example, when the terrain turned to hills, the cyclist had to struggle to climb the hills which caused him to use more of his energy. Also, if the terrain was flat and smooth, the cyclist had less problems making the long journey. For instance, if the cyclist had less strain on him then he would not be as tired and would not drink as much water. In conclusion, that is how the features of the setting affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1246	3	When the cyclist first set off, he was doing fine, he had plenty of water. As he kept going, and sort of got of cause, he began to come into the desert region. He was hot, and he was ruunning out of water. This was making him dehydrated. Also, seeing the tumbleweeds, and lack of vegetation probably made him even worse mentally, because he was maybe thinking he was never going to get free from that. When he saw the fish bate shop though, he was probably relieved that he was going to be saved,    	2	2		2																					
1250	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist. One reason I say this is because he ran out of water and he could dehidrate. Also looking for water slowed him dsown more. Another reason I say this is because the man gave him the wrong directions, which got him lost and confused. That is how the setting affected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1252	3	The feature of a setting can affect a cyclist energy. In the setting turns irds hills, it can every this Cyclist out.	1	1		1																					
1257	3	The features of the setting do affect the cyclist. If the road is rough you have to have the right bike. Then if you get a flat tire you have to know to look out for dangerous and posionous things. If you were in a real bad accident you�d have to be prepared just in case they don�t find you in time. You would have to know what nights were like. For example, if it got real cold at night you need to keep youself warm.	1	1		1																					
1260	3	How the features of the setting affected the cyclist in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Limit�, were very dangerous to his life. The cyclist was traveling to the Yosemite National Park on a hot @DATE1. The cyclist traveled miles after miles on his bike only to past by deserted towns, �This place might have been thriving little spot...a ghost town.� The terrain was threatening because after twenty two miles or so, the cyclist had to overcome, �short rolling hills�, which would use more energy and make his thirst for water even stronger. The cyclist was out of water and the hot day was not helping. After a grueling journey, the cyclist used all the strength he had to go to a local bait shop and drank from the sink after the trechorous environment he was exposed to. The features of the setting in the story, �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� were life threatening and almost killed the cyclist, due to lack of water and the terrain he overcome.	1	1		1																					
1261	3	The features of the setting effect the cyclist by teasing him. First it was the rippling streams that taunted his thirst, then the old faucet and last the welches grape factory. The strraing were the beginning stage simply provoking thirst then came the faucet. The faucet made him relise that he was dehydrated. And last the abandoned welches grape juice factory had him almost abandon hope. The setting was effecting his mood.	2	2		2																					
1265	3	The features of the setting affects the cyclist. Because the man didn�t have a lot of water and he was go into the California deserts in June. Another reason is because the flat road was changed into rolling hills and up ahead there was a sign that said �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit.� the speed limit was @NUM1. One more thing is make sure you don�t listen to a gentleman that is old and hadn�t be off ther porch in decades. That is some of the things that can affect the cyclist.	1	2		2																					
1268	3	The features affect the cyclist.The setting affects the cyclist because it�s real hot. So he takes a couple tips on some short cuts by some old men. Then come to find out these tips weren�t really short cuts. So now he�s riding and angry that he took their tips. Also he�s running out of water and becoming dehydrated. He sees an abonded place with water, but in order to get it you need to pump it. So he starts pumping and sees black gunk. He pumps for about @NUM1 to cool the water, but it doesn�t cool off. Come to find out the water tastes like battery acid. So he starts riding again. but encounters a snake. Luckily he gets away, but he feels that he�s about to die and regrets listening to men who haven�t got off their porch since @PERSON1 was president. What makes him more angry is that they seemed so sure. As as he's riding he sees a juice factory and goes there. Now it�s a fishing store and drinks lots and lots of water. He also says he�s never listening to old men and he�ll always use the map.	3	2		3																					
1270	3	The features of the surrounding setting affect the cyclist from hi/her performance for example, In the essay �Rough Road Ahead. Do Not Exceed Posted SPeed Limit� the setting is full of hills, twisting, rising and desending. All of these things are working against the energy that the cyclist has. Also, the lack of the people in towns give the cyclist a hard and depriving time on finding a water supply so he/she does not dehydrate. Third the weather in the essay has a great deal of being affected on the cyclist it is hot in the desert of California and the cyclist has to be very hydrated to continue on his bike ride.  	2	2		2																					
1279	3	The fatures of the setting affected the cyclist by it hard for him to control hill bike down on rough road, hotter making him thisty and running out of water. Also there wasnt an building in sight so he could get anything to drink. Also he did know where he was go. These are the features that affected the cyclist	2	2		2																					
1280	3	The setting affect the cyclist in many gruding and harsh was. First, the lack of civilization contributes to an uneasy feeling and an inability to refill his water bottle. Second, the heat and uphill bottles are taking their tollon both aplists physical and mental strength. Third, his water bottle is emptying at an alarming late due to his third and relentless heat. In paragraph four die exospodent cyclist reaches the first ''town.'' This place @MONTH1 have been a striving spell but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of ghost down.� @CAPS1 he came to house with a rusty water pump, which sped out brackish, near boiling water, which did not support the porched cyclist, physically, on mentally.	2	2		2																					
1281	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because �never accept travel advice from	1	1		1																					
1282	3	"The setting of the story affects the cyclist in a negative way. He intrusted that these men he had asked directions from knew what they were talking about. With the directions in mind he traveled on his way to his destination. Only to find deserted towns, disowned factorys, and hills. With all this being the �high deserts of California in June.� With all these aspects the cycalrst was worn out and dehydrated saying �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst"" shaving his deep name of thirst. After finding a place to get a drink he stated �I had an overwhelming and buy some bait� showing his deep gratitude and relief of finding water."	2	2		2																					
1284	3	While trying to reach Yosemite by a shortcut, the cyclist faced many challenges and emotions. The cyclist started out his journey cheerfully with thoughts of the cool pines of Yosemite. �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� The cyclist continued on his spirits as well as her water supply going down. The cyclist encouraged himself to keep going, just to find an open building. ��telling myself that if I could make it that far, I�d be fine.� @CAPS1 many abandoned factories, the cyclist tried many methods to decrease his thirst including sucking on stones. ��slowly gaining elevation while losing hope.� @CAPS2 the cyclist found a deserted building, he lost more and more hope. When the cyclist found open store with modern bathrooms, he had �an overwhelming urge to seek out @PERSON1, kiss them, and buy some bait.� At the end the cyclist promised himself to always use his map.	2	3		3																					
1293	3	I am going to write a response that explains how the features of the setting affects the cyclist. In my response, I will include examples from the essay that support my conclusion. I think the features in the setting affect the cyclist because different things such as snow or rocks could affect the way someone rides.	0	0		0																					
1297	3	"In the short story �Do not exeed the speed limit� by Joe Kurmaskie, the setting has great impact on the cyclist. In the begining of the story he describes the scenery as ""@CAPS1"". As he continued following the old mens out dated advice. It lead  him through more barren lands. When he came to the first ""town"" he described it as a ghost town. The second setting he arrived at was �One romshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldnt hold in the lamest muic� he continued moving to the next town, which was @NUM1 away, he came to what he thought was a Welch's Grape juice factory and bootling plant. This tools a toll on his confidence because he said ""I hung my head"" he moved on and had finally arrived at un abandoned buiding called ""@PERSON2 and wilbers�s fish camp. ""This is where he drunk water and became repleshed. The setting had a great effect on the cyclist. Because depending on the location, decided weather he would live or die in the hot deserts of California."	2	2		2																					
1303	3	"In this story the cyclest was affected physically and emotionally in many ways. One such way was the setting around him. For example, when he rode into the first town he gained of boost of confidence because he believed that he was on the right track to Yosemite. Then when the cyclist rode upon that old shed and the rusty water pumps he began to feel a little worried because he was running out of water and The Old Timers never mentioned the shed. When the cyclist encountered the rolling hills with tumbleweeds and snakes I believe he began to feel dismayed because he was lost. I believe this because in the text he says ""I was going to die and the birds would pick me dead."" This shows how hopeless the man fealt. when he reached ""Gary and @CAPS1 fish camp"" he was relieved and thankfull because he no longer had death blazing towands him in the form of a yellow sun, empty spaces, and empty water bottle. This was how the the features and setting affects him in many ways."	3	2		3																					
1304	3	Riding through beastly mountains, hot and burning deserts and no water. A cyclist was riding through a town and asked for directions. The two old men gave him the wrong directions and send him on a trip through hell that only a determined person could get through. First he had to go miles without water which resulted in him loosing faith becoming dehydrated and not continuing with his plans. The terrain he had to go through was unbearable and could almost kill him without water. Luckily he had faith and determined so he got through it and learned a lesion. Maps are made for people to use so if you have a map you should trust it and in the ending it shows that the cyclist learned that because he said �And I promised myself right then that I�d always stick to it in the future.�	3	3		3																					
1306	3	All the features of the environment through which the cyclist is riding affect him greatly. First, since he is riding through the desert in June, that means that it is very hoy out and he will need plenty of water for his long bike ride. Also, the terrain of which he is riding is rough which causes him to lose energy. The sun was also beggining to heat down on him which means that he was going to have a hot ride to the town and which later caused his struggle for water. Overall, the hot, desert setting affects the cyclist. It causes him to dehydrate and have a need for water. In the story it says, �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips� and that he could drop from a heatstroke on a beautiful day in June, This is basically showing that the hot environment caused him to drink a lot of water, and now he has run low which could cause him to have a heat stroke.	2	2		2																					
1307	3	THE FEATURES OF THE SETTING AFFECT THE CYCLIST BY DEPLETING HIS WATER SUPPLY, AND ALMOST GIVING HIM HEAT EXHAUSTION. IN THE TEXT, HE SAYS: THE WATER BOTTLES CONTAINED ONLY A FEW TANTALIZING SIPS.� THIS HOTNES HE HAS LITTLE WATER LEFT FOR SURVIVAL UNTIL HE RUNS OUT.	1	1		1																					
1312	3	The fetures in the settings like hills, make the cycleist use more energy, the more enegy that he uses the more water he will whant to drink. This is difficult because he states �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips�. Therefore he was in trouble.	2	2		2																					
1314	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist�s mood towards the journey. At first, he is confident that the old men�s knowledge of the land is accurate and he is excited about what lies ahead for him. However, his excitement soon turned into dismay and slight doubt as his journey drags on. The heat of the weather and lack of water makes the cyclist develop an uncaring matter. �I�d read once that sucking on stones helps�with any luck I�d hit a bump and lodge one in my throat.� The verbal irony in this passage delivers a negative feeling to the reader and it is here that it is clear that the cyclist doesn�t care what happens to him. When he finally reaches a sign of civilization, the cyclist becomes himself again and decides that his knowledge is best.	3	3		3																					
1315	3	In the story �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit while riding his bike the author Joe Kurmaskie has alongride. Where he is riding there is up and down hills also the road is very rough. He was running out of water in the desert. �I stopped at a rusted water pump to get water and a tar like substance oozed out.� @CAPS1 that he is off his bike he least worrie about the posionous snakes of the desert. He founded Welch�s grape juice factory but it was abandoned. The author found a bait shop and got water	2	2		2																					
1329	3	The features and setting in the story affected the cyclist because they made his journey to Yosemite even harder. In the story it says that it was so hot he could drop dead from heatstroke. Also his lack of water made him extreamly tired as he petaled. Next the sun was beating down so not only was he tired due to his lack of water but also because of it being so hot out he was loosing water and energy from his sweat. Thats why the features and setting made his journey to YoSemite difficult.	2	2		2																					
1331	3	Features of the setting that affect the cyclist are �the cool pines and rushing rivers� they affect the cyclist by keeping him cool and energized by the senery and the temperature, another is the juice factory and it was old and shut down showing that he would die alone. The goast town which was completely and utterly desserted showing that the place is barren and unlivible these are some of the features the affect the biker.	2	1		2																					
1332	3	The cyclist is very discouraged by the dry and hot settings around him. A feature is something specific about some thing else. In �Rough Road Ahead. Do not exceed posted speed limit the cyclist takes the advice of a few old men that seems to be somewhat outdated, and gets him lost as he is running out of water and energy. The cyclist says �Over one long, crppling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn�t a mirage� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). He is greatly affected by the heat and was so tired he wanted to make sure the building was not an illusion. Also, the changed terrain affected how much water he drank and how hard he had worked just to get up that one long hill. The dry climate and tough terrain greatly affected the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1336	3	In the essay �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit� the cyclist is on a journey to Yosemite National Park and stops for advice on a quicker route. When he asks the old men he says, �Never accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven�t left the confines of their porches since carter was in office.� Along with using their advice he faces abandoned ghost towns that they said were thriving spots. The cyclist overcomes the rolling hills of terrain and mirages and the heat of a day in June in the California in deserts. Finally he sees bait and tack shop and when he sees that the men who own the place are older than the other guys he just stares at them in all. Based on the quote you can infer that the cyclist will ignore their advice about having the best map. 	2	2		2																					
1339	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie. The downhill land format helped him in a way because he wouldn�t have to use strength and pedal as hard without having as much water in his body. When he came to a pump, it was rusty with tar oozing out followed by hot brackish water flavored like battery acid. The dryness of the dessert had a bad affect on the cyclist because he wasn�t able to get to the Yosemite water until the end. The breeze of the wind had a positive affect because it helped to cool him down. The features of the setting in the story �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie affect the cyclist.	2	2		2																					
1343	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist physically. The want of the California desert canes the cyclist to became tired and dehydrated. For example the another states �I cased past, trying to keep my balance dehydrated star,� The setting is the main factory which causes the cyclist to become dehydrated.	1	1		1																					
1344	3	One part of the setting that is affecting him is the sun, which is mercilessly overheating the biker. Another problem is the terrain he is on, which is a number of small hills is wearing him out. There are also apparently no trees for shade and no clouds or wind to cool him off.	1	1		1																					
1347	3	The features of the setting do indeed affect the cyclist. First in the story when describing the setting it says �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.� @CAPS1 basically giving a hint or foreshadow that something bad is going to happen because hes alone. Another description of the setting when it affects the cyclist when it says �Rough Road Ahead; Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� @CAPS1 pretty much saying danger ahead, something bad will happen.	1	1		1																					
1349	3	Poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, and dry dead tumbleweed these features in the setting that the cyclist was going through have the greatest effect of all. They showed the trecherous path he took the obstacles he had to surpass the prevail. The purpose of including some features of the setting like the poisonous snakes, mirages, rolling hills, no signs of life, and no water all show and impact how bad the conditions were. If it left out these sectives the audience could say/think he was traveling through any old trail, for all they know the cyclist could be traveling along a windy river passing threw nice developed towns, so you see the features in the setting help set the mood and also reveal the confident of the story.	1	2		2																					
1360	3	The feature in the setting affeted the cyclist alot. It was a hot summer day and he was running out of water. With oll the heat he could have had a heat stroke. Another problem was the hills. He didn't have alot of energy, ?? the sun were tiding it from him.	1	1		1																					
1362	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because as he gets closer to the nearest town  the ground becomes rougher to ride on. Like when he sees the sign saying not to exceed the limit. That shows that the ground is going to be rough.	1	1		1																					
1367	3	The cyclist does most really like the setting of the road. It�s messing up big time	0	0		0																					
1372	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in this story greatly. The cyclist is cycling in a desert, �...I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June.� @CAPS1 it was hot and the sun is beating down on the cyclist, �the sun was beginning to beatdown...� @CAPS1 it is remote and there is no one to offer help or assistance, �...it fit the traditional definition of ghost town.� There are no natural water sources for the cyclist to refill his bottles of water. He might have died from dehydration. �I got down on my hands and knees and worked the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength, but only a tarlike substance oozed out.� There @CAPS1 was a poisonous snake on the road which could have bit the cyclist. @CAPS1, there were hills that required more energy to get up. Since the cyclist had to use more energy to get up the hills he got more tired and thirsty.	2	2		2																					
1376	3	The features mentioned in the settings of the story made it harder for the cyclist. The lack of water during a summer in California  made it very uncomfortable for the cyclist to go through the deserts. The worst part was when he tried to suck the pebbles to cycle his saliva in his mouth, he ended up swallowing one.	1	1		1																					
1377	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because his body has a hard time adjusting to his life threating situation. The neat and desert atmosphere are draining his body of water, @CAPS1 he needs to keep pedaling on. Also, the terrain is stripped of water, so he doesn't have anything to refuel with. 	1	1		1																					
1378	3	I think that if we where to inforce the punishments on those who speed that there wuold be less car crashes really those that have bad road rage shuold be in anger management	0	0		0																					
1379	3	"There were many features that affected the cyclist. One feature included the first ghost town that he come by. �but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town.� This had to affect him a little because he knows now that the people who told him the shortcut haven�t peen out for awhile. Another feature that affected the cyclist was the lack of water in a ""desert in California in June."" The cyclist now knows that it might be awhile before he gets any more water. The hills also had an affect on the cyclist because he knew now he was going to have to work really hard to get into the next town, without drinking much water. The Welch�s building also had an affect on him since it was abandoned and no drinks were left. In conclusion, the cyclist had to battle many features on his way to the National Park."	2	2		2																					
1380	3	The cyclist see his journey affect by a succesion of events that will make his journey trave?? every time more difficul and difficult. One of the first errors his makes is take advice from people that have no clue of where there are at. @CAPS1 (I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map.) The temperature of the desert also influenced him (I was travelling through high desert of California). The  cyclist also finds his' self with a combination of emotions at times he thinks he is going to past away and at times he believes he will be fine. (@CAPS1 @NUM1) As i stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drunk deeply from the sink, I thought i had a over whelming wigs to seek Gary.	2	3		3																					
1382	3	In the story, The man has a very hard time trying to get to some water. He faces many obsticales in the story. For example, he has gone about @NUM1 miles without water. Also, their are a lot of hills and turns withen the story which slow him down He is having a hard time getting to water because of many obsticals	1	1		1																					
1384	3	The features affected the cyclist because of the rough roads. This affected him because it slowed him down, I know this because in the story it said �Rough Road Ahead Do not Exceed Posted speed Limit�. which this means slow down or you will have an accident. Another feature has it was hot which means he was losing water because it either evaporated or he was drinking it. I know this because it said �The water bottles contained  water a few tantalizing sips� which means it was few left.	2	1		2																					
1389	3	Some things that affected the cyclist was the terrain changing into a flat road that was replace by short, rolling hills. Then he came to a rough road. Another obstacle from the cyclist was the tar-like substance that came out the rusted water pump followed by brackish water feeling somewhere of @NUM1 hundred degrees. Everytime he pumped it wouldn�t cool down and the water tasted like battery acid. He was hitting his water bottle regularly that is why he needed new water. The cyclist was travelling through the high deserts of California and the sun was starting to beat down so he was dehydrated. The snake blocked the pavement in front of him that looked like diamond back.  	2	2		2																					
1393	3	The wether can change the corse of action a cyclist will take. If it is cold out side then the cyclist will bring beveyer cloths if its. Hoter out side he would most likly bring lighter clothes. If he was riding farther hed bring more supplys like water and food If he was going on a short rid then he wouldn�t bring so much stuff. The way the wether is changes the way a person will prepaire,	1	1		1																					
1403	3	Each area the author entered changed what he felt and experienced. At first, he is lent courage by his surroundings. When he passes through the first town, abandoned and empty, he is still confidant he can go on sparred by the lush green trees and the cool rivers around him that belied the hot sun overhead. They are basically the reason he continued to go on. Later on during his trek through the desolated empty desert, his bleak surroundings make him feel hopelessness as well as despair. Even in the small details, such as the ghost town or the pump, this is ploven, as the ghost town brings him the first vestige of despair, and the useless pump only amplifys it. The scenario and scenery reflect and alter the authors mood throughout the story.	1	1		1																					
1405	3	Some features of the setting that affect the cyclist are. The hills that the cyclisit has to go over and the heat. The heat is making the cyclist sweat alot so he is loosing fluids and he starts to got dyhydrated. The hills are making him have to work harder and getting more tired.	1	1		1																					
1406	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist in many ways. They affected his confidence, his energy, and his determination. In the beginning of the essay the cyclist is very confident. This is show when he says.� The cool pined and rushing rivers of yosemite has my name written all over them. This shows confidence because he knows he can make it to yosemite.When he runs out of water he begins to lose confidence and thinks he way die. Since he ran out of water because of the heat, his energy is also dropped. You know he�s running out of water when he says.�The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� @CAPS1, after lose of water and confidence; he actually had higher determination to make it to Yosemite. This is human nature because our bodies when into survivor mode and become determined to survive. As you can see the cyclist was affected in many ways by the features of the setting.	3	2		3																					
1409	3	I think that the features of the setting affected the cyclist because of the sharp turns and the lonelyness it say in the text �About forty miles into the pedal. I arrived at the first town.�	1	1		1																					
1415	3	In �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie the main character faces a lot of trouble. First people give him the wrong directions. But, worst of all he has to travel a lot of mile on a bike through extreme temperatures. Going up and down hills and pedaling really hard. He doesn�t even have any cool water. As the character says, ��followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees (kurmaskie @NUM1). That kind of water didn�t help him either. It didn�t quench his thirst because it was so hot, he said it tasted like battery acid. But, finally he worked up his confidence and kept pedalig till he found a fish camp that had a bathroom with a sink that had cool water. Then he headed off to Yosemite and didn�t take anyone�s advice.	3	2		3																					
1420	3	Setting in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� really determines how the story turns out. The setting was in deserted areas, the desert, and even roadways. In the desert, there is no water making the cyclist become dehydrated. without water, he thought he was going to die. In the road areas, the speed limits was extremly high fifty-five miles per hour. This would not be good since he is doing  � a water-depleting @NUM1.� When he finds areas that are abandoned, these are water pumps, but the liquid that comes out @MONTH1 be water, but it tastes like �battery acid.� Setting can affect alot in the story. Without this setting, the story would be alot different than it is now.	3	2		3																					
1424	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist a lot. First is the emptiness, the feeling that he is all alone. Nor a car, person  or building in sight. The fact that if something were to happen then there would be no way of telling anyone. That it would be along while before  anyone would be able to  find him. Nor that  might ecase some, But I think dalved him even more. It gave him that extra boost of energy that seems  to have come out of nowhere. Then there is the type of animal. The desert environment is very, unforgiving. The sun beats down like your only person on the plannet. The lack of water the food that it hasn�t rained in decades. The never ending, @CAPS1 road. The ups and downs and all the animals that await him. The fact that if he stops at all, ever, then a snake could easily bite him and that would be the end of it. These extreme conditions and the harsh environment that is explained in the text has alot to do with the cyclist and affects him a great deal.  	2	3		3																					
1425	3	The setting of this short story affects the cyclist by making him dehydrated and dies. Also in the setting he found the abandon factory which makes him feel hopeless. If the setting was elsewhere then this setting he would have felt different as he didn�t  meet the people  of the reserve he could have been in the better roads than the old roads he was in	1	1		1																					
1432	3	The features of the setting in �DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� affect the cyclist in a negative way. The terrain goes from being very mild to rough and rolling. Considering that the author does not know the layout of this terrain very well, he begins to struggle. The author is very unsure of where to go and begins encountering obstacles such as, tumbleweed, snakes and lack of water. The fact that the author is running out of water, makes continuing on a very stressful. He is worried that he will die of dehydration before he ever reaches Yosemite National Park. Finally, with much strength and determination, he reaches a fish a Fish camp. He is able to fill his water supply and regain his strength before pressing on.	3	2		3																					
1436	3	The settings affect the cyclist in more than one way. These ways are that he is running out of water, he might become dehydrated and he is unsure of the path he is on. With him running out of water, he is in real trouble. Because of the lack of water, not only might be die but he begins to see mirages. His lack of water eventually leads to dehydration and he become uneasy about things. For example; in the text it says that he staggered into the store. Because he is unsure of the path he is on, he begins to panic a little. Panicing isn�t good especially considering that he is running low on water and is becoming dehydrated. Panic can�t help to solve anything. The setting is in a dessert so he needs lets of water, which he runs low on. Desserts are extremly hot which causes a person to become dehydrated or die. Desserts have little shade, if any; and they have rough weather as well as rough landscape. For example, they�re landscape is mostly all hot sand. Therefore, the setting does affect the cyclist.	3	2		3																					
1439	3	The setting affected the cyclist because the terrain you ride on can determine how you ride. For instance when you have hills and dry weather like they did when it said �flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills� The one easy terrain was now made more difficult and only added to his frustration and his dehydration from having no water. Also the heat contributed plenty and it was there the whole time.  Sometimes he didn�t seem to notice or feel it but it was there and it was taking energy from him: Like when it said, �The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it.� He didn�t know it but that took from him so he drank more water and that affected his ability to take enough to complete the ride.	3	3		3																					
1440	3	"The cyclist was riding in the hot, desert. This made him thirsties and less active. The story says, ""The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt."""	1	1		1																					
1443	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. He always kept his head up and was determined to make it to his destination. The first problem was when he came to the �fork of sorts� as he put it. He needed more water, but the pumps were rusty and all he could get out of them was a tarlike substance followed by blackish water. He tested it, hoping it was better than it looked, but it wasn�t. It tasted like battery acid. He was very thirsty, but had to move on, looking for another water supply. Another problem that occured was, while he was becoming dehydrated more & more by the minute and unsteady on his bike, a huge snake lay across the road. He had to slowly maneuver around it, though it was hard, he was successful and continued down the road. The third ""obstacle"" he ran into was he was so thirsty and finally had a chance for a drink, when to his dissappointment, he found an old abandoned welches grape juice factory. As nervie and upsetting as it was, he continued to move on, still determined to make it to his destination. He finally came up to a fishing supply store where he was able to take a break and get a nice drink! Even though the setting was tough, teasing, and ironic, the man made it through and still with a smile on his face."	3	3		3																					
1446	3	The features of the setting affected the cyclist by for the roads and heat has. He has tine ling through a desert in June which made it really hot for him, @CAPS1 that the road was bumpy and that made him have to pedal harder.  The @CAPS1 had to prit more effort into it because the romds here long and he had the spirit and determination to get to Yosemite. He @CAPS1 ran into a snake which told him that I am getting deeper into the desert.	2	2		2																					
1452	3	"In the story, these are many elements that affected the cyclist in his journey.The first features of the setting that affects him is the old water pump, which did not work, and when it did the water from it lasted horrible. The next obstacles on his journey was rough terrain. ""Flat road  was replaced by short rolling hills,"" was how he described it. When the narrator finally finds a building, it turns out to be  abandoned. Eventually he finds a  town and rest after his long journey, and learns his lesson from before not to take advice from people he doesn�t know."	2	2		2																					
1459	3	Hot, @CAPS1, @CAPS2-all are the features of the setting that affect the cyclist. First, the hot days with not a lot of water to drink. He will get dehydrated. Also, there is no one around to help him if he gets lost. Joe Kurmaskie explains �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structur of any kind. Finally the creature was a large snake that came along on road. So he had to move around it.	2	2		2																					
1477	3	The cyclist is most affected by e heat. He is exerting all his energy and will to get to Yosemite. The hot sun and lack of water makes him very tired and causes him to use his energy inefficiently. At one point, he has to make sure the building is a mirage. It is so hot his mind could be playing tricks on him.	1	1		1																					
1481	3	Some of the features of the setting that affected the cyclist were the rough terrain and the hills. It says in  the reading � flat road was replaced by short rolling hills� this would wear a person out without a good supply of water and is not sure in what direction he is travelling. And another thin g that affects him is the hot june weather in California.	2	1		2																					
1497	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is in a dessert like place with a water surfage and he could hard tired. I would never have asked old people, he should have ask someone that was in charge of a store, because those people get asked many times. also he could have died if that snake got him or from what he said �heatroke.�	1	1		1																					
1501	3	"The settnig can greatly effect the cyclist. The palce can change what happens and how it happens. For example if the story had taken place in alaska the cyclist would not have had, ""Wide rings of sweat circling my shirt."" and instead have been fighting off hypo thermia. The setting is very important because it affects all of the details in the writing. "	2	2		2																					
1504	3	The setting affected the cyclist by depriving him of hydration and weakening him. The large hills and rough roads ebbed away every bit of his strength and wore him down. The narration states, �Over one long, crippling hill� (kurmaskie @NUM1). This work choice reflects the writer�s feeling about his adventure. Words like �long� and �crippling� show that the trip was a horrible experience.	1	1		1																					
1506	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist when he was thirsty. �A sand blasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice in his mouth could be seen.� This proves that the rider was thirsty because in the paragraph before this talks about him having a last burst of energy going down a hill. And he was also sweating a lot. And also wiping sweat from his eyes. 	1	1		1																					
1509	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. For one, a lot of the settings discoured the cyclist. �This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time- say, before the last world war- but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. As soon as the cyclist hits this �town� he realizes that the old mens advice might not have been so great. The dry desert affects the cyclist the most. This hot climate makes the cyclist extremely thirst, hot, and and sweaty. �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from a heatstroke...� The cyclist's tune here is sarcastic but he is still concerned about his health because of the heat and lack of water. The fact that there is nothing living around the cyclist also affects him. Since he�s talked to the old men for directions he hasn�t seen a glimpse of life, or buildings or anything. So this definetly discourages the cyclist and makes him lose his will to continue his journey. In conclusion, the features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways. 	3	3		3																					
1511	3	In the essay, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit,'' the cyclist is affected doth emotionally and physically by the features of the setting. At the start, when he came to a deserted shed with rusty pumps, he began to feel discouraged. �[The] sight was troubling,�(page @NUM1) @CAPS1 on in the essay, the terrain changes from flat land to short, rolling hills and tumbleweeds began to pass. The cyclist is definitely affected by the change in terrain. He is now exhaugnted but continues to pump his legs and ride on. Before the end of his ride, the cyclist reaches an abandoned @ORGANIZATION1. The setting how includes a large picture of a young boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice. The author seems almost detected by this. �I hung my head'' (page @NUM2) he confessed. In the end, once he finds an old fishermans store, he is relieved seeing the store from a distance excited the author, because, he could finally have a drink. The author mood and body were greatly affected by that features of the setting.	3	2		3																					
1516	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist because he is tRying to bike up hills and down hills, which can be very tiRing. Also, the hot aiR can dehydRate him, which can cause him to pass out. Along with the dRy aiR, theRe is dRy land, which means theRe is no place to stop foR wateR oR take a @CAPS1. The Rough @CAPS2 make the biking naRaeR because it involves moRe eneRgy than biking on a smooth path. Finally, the snake in the  middle of the Road made it haved foR the bikeR to go aRound. If the snake would have bitten him he could have died fRom poison.	2	2		2																					
1519	3	In �Rough Road Ahead: Do not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie the setting of the terrain was hot and water draining. In the text it says �Followed by blackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two-hundred degrees� this proves that the cyclist is exagerating about the very hot temperature of the high deserts of California. The setting is also water draining and had to stop in the desert town to refill his water bottle as in the text says �I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of a rusted water pump with all my strength.� This proves that the cyclist had to stop for water and using much power to pump it out. In conclusion always prepare for the worst but hope for the best. 	2	2		2																					
1524	3	A cyclist can only travel as fast as slow as he pedals. If the setting is a humid sunny day he can�t go to fast due to his lung capacity. If it is a warm but windy day he has to wath his speed to keep from getting hurt. Basically unless the weather is nice or safe enough he will go fast. But his safty care first so it depend on the weather mostly but also the time of the day. If it is night [dark] the reflectors must be put on to keep from getting it.	1	1		1																					
1530	3	THE CYCLIST SETTINGS HINDER HIM IN THE ESSAY �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD. THE CYCLIST IS IN THE DESERT IN THE SUMMER TIME WITH HARDLY ANY WATER. HE IS TRYING TO FIND HIS WAY TO YOSEMITE, BUT HE GETS LOST ALONG THE WAY BECAUSE SOME OLD MEN GAVE HIM BAD DIRECTIONS. DURING THIS TIME HE IS RIDING HIS BICYCLE FOR MILES AND MILES IN THE HEAT OF THE SUMMER. HIS THOUGHTS OF THIRST GET IN THE WAY OF HIM TRYING TO CONTINUE ON TO FIND YOSEMITE. I BELIEVE THAT IF THE CYCLIST WAS IN A COOLER ENVIRONMENT THEN THINGS WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT BECAUSE HIS SETTINGS WERE SORT OF A DISTRATION TO HIM	1	2		2																					
1537	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist  greatly. The features is old abandon towns and hot temperatures. Also abandoned buildings. This makes the cyclist think All hope is lost. The essay says this �Over one long crippling hill, a bulding came into view [...] I hung my head that smoky blues tune ""summertime rattle around."" Then to a happy mo In an ironic twist that should please all sadist reading this, the building [...] by the looks  afit had been a welch�s  grape Juice factory and bottling plant [...] I hung my head that smoky bluees tune sumertime rattle around.� Then to a happy mood it states �As I stumbled into a ra ther modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, i had a overwhelming  urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them.""  "	2	2		2																					
1540	3	Excitement, desperation, and self-pitty are all feelings the cyclist had because of the setting. He was really excited to get to Yosemite park because of it peacefulness. He said, �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite are calling my name.� He wanted to get their because it was so hot. He started getting desperate for water, so he drank out of this hot water hole. �I tried a drop or two, tasted like battery acid.� He was running out of water so he got desperate for some. He started to have self-pitty on his self,� sometimes life can be so cruel,� he was feeling pitty on himself because he had such a long way to go still. These are all feeling the cyclist had because of the setting.	2	2		2																					
1544	3	The features of the setting affect the cyclist by when the story says �Twenty miles up the road. I came to a fork of sorts�, This statement from the story affected the cyclist because he didn�t know which way to go. Another feature that affected the setting is when the story says �I got on my hand and knees, Working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength�. That statement shows that the cyclist was dieing for water and he didn�t think any was going to come out. Last feature that affected the cyclist was when the story says �Rough road ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit. This shows that the rider had to go under a speed limit but he was earlier tired and he was going way under it and that he could make it up the rough road.	2	3		3																					
1545	3	The dry, deserted area the cyclist is in, has many caations and	2	2		2																					
1554	3	In the essay, the description of the setting was dry, hot, very open, and desserted. The description could suggest lonlieness, obviously. Even though the man was all alone and didn�t know where he was going, he still persisted. While he thought about �the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite.� This thought kept him strong, so he kept trying.	1	1		1																					
1562	3	The author finds the desolate and harsh settings to be not discouraging, rather they stand out as a cause of amusement and fun, quest-like tests. The author writes that after arriving at his first ghost-town, he chuckles, amused by the funny �old codgers� and their crazy ideas. When he arrives at the second establishment, and realizes it isn�t the least bit established anymore, he�s slightly disappointed, but sees it as �a test of [his] inner spirit.� At the third building an abandoned factory he still appreciates the irony of the situation. While biking across the desert, he refuses to be discouraged by the empty horizon and instead uses it as a point of reference to work his progress and as a way to push himself. Though the author is faced with empty disappointing views, he keeps his spirits up and keeps pushing 	1	1		1																					
1565	3	"The features in the setting of the essay �Rough Road Ahead Do not exeed the Posted Speed limit� affect the cyclist in a cruel manner. The old man say that the towns are going to be there and they are just not functioning towns. To make the cyclist feel hopeless the setting puts him in a California day in June which is extremely hot and puts in all these unexpected twists. A cruel thing to add in the essay was when it read �The Speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water depleting 12 mph� This lowers the cyclists confidence making him seem more worried. Another cruel thing is the author adding a welch�s Grape Juice factory that had been abandoned with �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring @NUM1 refreshing glass of juice into his mouth"" totally causing him to lose hope left. These features in setting are cruel."	3	3		3																					
1571	3	The setting affected the cycist because it made his ride harder. For example, the weather was extremly hot. �The sun was beginning to beat down.� He says it didn�t affect him, yet he was very thirsty and dehydrated so internally it affected him. Also, the weeds and snakes frightened him. �tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake.� This could not of made his ride easier. Next the hills and roads, �over one long, crippling hill.� This proves how intense his ride was. Thats how the setting affected the cyclist in �Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit� by Joe Kurmaskie.	1	2		2																					
1572	3	The features of the nearby setting affect the cyclist in a bad way. The four main things that affect him are the heat, lack of water, lack of nearby buildings, and @CAPS2. For this cyclist one of the biggest problems is the heat. He says� i was travelling through the high deserts of California in June�. this shows that it is quite hot outside by the month stated. June is quite a hot month especially in @CAPS1 deserts. The second problem is the cyclist lack of water. He says throughout the story how thirsty he is and how much he needs to drink some water. When he reaches the end, however he finds water. The third problem is when he needs water, he can�t find anywhere due to the lack of buildings. He pedals great distances trying to find �towns� nearby. Once he finds them, they are either �ghost towns� or are not useful at all. The final problem he faces is the @CAPS2. He says �At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake� blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me.� @CAPS2 is getting in his way and not helping him to reach his destination at all. Truly . the features of the nearby setting are affecting him in a tramatizing way, because so many things like heat, lack of water , buildings, and @CAPS2 are inches way.	3	2		3																					
1573	3	The settings effects the cyclist because in California it could be really hot sometimes. The cyclist could dehydrate on a long trip and pass out really get hurt. Also there are a lot of hills which could be really hard on the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1582	3	When riding a bike for a very long time with no water is bad but is even worst when your surroundings are worst. For example, when the cyclist has no water it is a day with nothing around him to help. Also with no water he could pass out & get dehydrated. When he finds no one to help & nothing around him he sucks on a pebble to keep his mouth hydrated. Therefor you should always check you destination on a bike before just going for it.	2	2		2																					
1583	3	It is very difficult to be outside in heat, let alone advise from old folks and riding a bike. If it feels like it is @NUM1 out sides, you don�t need to be out there. Doesn,t matter how long you are outside for, a heatstroke could come at any body fast than they can count to @NUM2.	1	1		1																					
1587	3	"The features of the setting in �Do Not @CAPS1 Posted Speed Limit� affected the cyclist. The text states, ""Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills,"" (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The flat road that was easy to bike on had changed to many hills that made the cyclist's job alot harder. The biker was negatively affected by this setting because it contributed to his rough times and caused him to lose hope."	2	2		2																					
1588	3	In the story �Rough Road Ahead� the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected by the features of the setting in many ways. One way the cyclist is affected is when they have to cross the hills and plains. The hills make it very hard to pedal when going up hill. Another way the cyclist is challenged is when he is almost out of water. They need water to survive especially during their long bike ride. Lastly, the heat the cyclist must endure also affects them. The heat makes it hard to stay focused on making the long journey.	2	2		2																					
1604	3	The features of the setting did not help the cyclist on his trip. First of all he was in the desert on a bike! Which helped him dehydrate faster. Secondly, the �towns� around the way  had been abandoned, leaving no place to get more water and no place to ask for directions. Lastly there were no other people around so if the cyclist was to get into trouble, he wouldn't be able to find help. 	2	1		2																					
1615	3	Some of the features like the change in landscape affected the cyclist. Differing from flat land to miniture hills to highways is kind of hard to cope with, especially considering he was dehydrated and had no water.	1	1		1																					
1617	3	"The features of the environmental setting is affecting the cyclist. A setting is a certain time and place an event is taking place along with the setting their are features, which is the background description basically giving away additional information about the subject or idea. The features along with the setting are intefering with the cyclist by the hot temperature in Lodi, California making the cyclist or biker hotter than usualier as he heads in the wrong direction closer and nearer to the hot blazen scroaching desert. In addition to this he is running out of water and is beginning to get more and more exhausted from the heat plus he is starting to lose consciousness along with getting dehydrated. This is a major problem for the character because he is losing his sense of direction and because of this he is getting more panickly as his supply of water is running extremely low. A instance of the environmental setting affecting the cyclist is �I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweet circled my skirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heartstroke on a gorgeous in June ""(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1)."" @CAPS1 example is �This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly and I was travelling through the high deserts of California in June �(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM2)�. The hotness and heat had also increased the character�s confidence in himself as he was getting more and more panickly. A instance of this is �I began breaking the ride down into distances. I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it this far, I�d be fine �(Joe Kurmaskie, @NUM1). In conclusion, the hot setting in California had affected the cyclist in a number of ways it had exhasted his water supply and this caused him to become exhausted, dehydrated, and making him lose his logically sense to make decisions however his loss of sense of direction also gave him more self confidence as he stirved to the roads and serves town that was about twenty miles away in order to get water so that he @MONTH1 survive."	3	3		3																					
1618	3	"The features of the setting affect the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe Kurmaskie in many ways. One way the setting affected the cyclist way when it got hot and the rider was running out of water. another way the cyclist was affected by the setting was when he said he ""could die of heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because of listened to some gentlemen who hadn�t been off their porch in decades caused me to laugh. a third way the cyclist was affected was was when he went inside the bait shop and cooled down. lastly when he rehydrated himself in the  so the setting was a main factory to the cyclist in the essay �Rough Road Ahead� by Joe kurmaskie on his way to Yosemite national park."	2	1		2																					
1620	3	The setting affected the cyclist mood in the story. The cyclist was riding rough terrain and rolling hills. This made the cyclist feel like his journey was hopeless. When the cyclist arrived at the abandoned @CAPS1 Grape Factory he felt on twist of many. He was extremely thirsty and there used to be a @ORGANIZATION1 build there when the cyclist was a the fock in the road, he thought he could get some water. When this failed the cyclist was even less determined. He felt like the world was against him.	2	2		2																					
1622	3	As the author cycles through this shortcut, he is in a very dangerous setting. As said in the poem, he is in the high deserts of California in June. A desert makes the heat unberable for the cyclist. Its just sun, sand, and him. Then it tells the month summer of course makes the temperatures for the cyclist about @NUM1 almost maybe even hotter. This could cause him to drink plenty of water and almost lose all of his water supply. �The water bottle contained only a few tantalizing sips.� Then there is the distance of his ride. The author is always saying �About @NUM2 miles� or �Twenty miles up the road.� All of this hard work can cause heatstroke & kill him.	2	2		2																					
1625	3	There are a lot of things that effect the cyclist, such as the heat, having no water, the rough roads and the long trip. The cyclist is out in a desert so it is very hot. The narriation says, �and the growing realization that I could die drop from heatstroke� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). This means that he or she was very hot and dehydrated. The roads were very rough, for example, �ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT� (Kurmaskie @NUM1). The roads became, bumpy, and there were a lot of hill the cyclist had to go over. There was no water either. So he/she was running out of energy and it made it even harder. In the end the cyclist survived and drank a lot of water.	2	2		2																					
1633	3	The features of the setting effected the cyclist in many ways. The setting was verry hot and there were a lot of hills. The cyclist had been riding up and down hills all day and it took a lot of energy when he saw the building that he thought could help him he said, �... last burst of energy, i mane'uvered down the hill,� By saying that it showed that the setting of where he was contained a lot of hillsy and they effected him by taking up all his energy. That is how the setting had effected the cyclist.	1	1		1																					
1638	3	In the story the setting affected the cyclist all through the story till he arrived at body and wilbers fish camp. As the man rides his bike for a while he is of but as he road into the first town it seemed to be a ghost town. As he pedal on � The sun was beginning to beat down but I barely noticed it�. At that time the wheater is affecting him a lot but he keeps Yosemite cool pines and rushing rivers in his head He also only had only a few tantalizing sips left in his water bottle while going up a big hill.	2	1		3																					
1644	3	The cyclist is faced with many challenges on his journey to Yosemite, one of which is travelling through the California deserts. This was quite a challenge because a desert is very hot and dry, plus the author was riding his bike, making  himself more thirsty and hot. He also encountered a big snake that appeared to be a diamondback which he avoided even though it almost covered the road. The author also had to deal with rough terrain when he rode his bike through the hills. The biker met the challenges and progressed through them with bravery.	2	2		2																					
1654	3	In the story the fact that no one was around, there were no buildings, he had no water, and was lost. Had a negative affect on the cyclist, he was doubting himself the whole time. Although he did perserver and made it through the tough situation he was in.	1	1		1																					
1658	3	In the story Rough Road Ahead the author takes a trail he had previously heard about. After the ride didn�t turn out to be what he expected it to be, the setting began to �set in�. The aridity of the climate would cause the author to have to struggle against himself and the conditions around him. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with. Also his lack of water was a problem to begin with but the scorching sun would make him become dangerously dehydrated.	1	2		2																					
1660	3	The setting in �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Speed Limit� has a great effect on the main character in the story. In the beginning of the story, he passes the first �town� and continues riding his bike, following the directions some old folks gave him. �The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over it.� His mood at this point was already confident, but this adds to it, with words like �rushing� being encouraging to him. Then, he continues moving on the road. �Not two miles into this section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing.� At this point, he is becoming unsure of how good the directions he obtained really were. Once he is already tired, rolling hills isn�t what he wanted to find, so this adds to his doubt. Further along, he said, �There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. �This adds to the despair he was feeling, because he feels he is going to die in Yosemite. Not seeing anyone was probably extremely discouraging, so the setting really affected him. Then he said �over the long crippling hill, a building came into view.� It is at this point that he uses the word �crippling� because he is just about exhausted and can�t go any further.	2	2		2																					
1661	3	The features in the setting greatly affect the cyclist. He is riding through this deserted and beaten up town that makes him feel weird. After that he starts to ride through the desert when a huge snake gets in his way and scares him even more. When he arrives at the abandoned juice factory he is almost completely out of energy and almost can�t go on any further in his journey until he finally arrives at the bait shop. Most of the features in the setting scare the cyclist but they all affect him.	2	2		2																					
1668	3	The setting of the story had effected the cycle�s becuse if it was sub earbs he could have stoped any where and got water but the plot was in a middle of a desert and all he could do is keep rolling and hoping to find some water For example, he had to go @NUM1 miles to get to the next town to get water and if he was not in the desert with hills he could have made that in no time at all    	1	1		1																					
1672	3	The setting of this story is outside. Yosemite is outside riding her bike. She is around hills, no water, and very hot land. You know that she is around hills because she says to herself, �� I maneuvered down the hill.� You also know that she starts of around no??? ???good water. �When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid�� that shows the water was bad. Also the land is very hot because it says ��in the??? ???of two hundred degrees.� Yosemite starts off bad then ends up learning to stick to it and never give up. Yosemite�s biggest problem is her lack of water due to the fact that it is hot outside and the water she had was bad, tasting like battery acid. 	1	1		1																					
1679	3	The setting of the desert is a hard setting to be in with no water or help. If the author would have been on a population trait with water fountain and shade, he would have been fine. But, he was in the desert no one around, hot, dry, no water, and no shade. �tumbleweeds crossed my path� (@CAPS1 @NUM1). This dicride his loneleness because no one was in the desert to help him. The setting could have killed him if it was not for the fish camp. The setting had a huge affected on the author.	2	2		2																					
1681	3	"In �Rough Road Ahead: Do Not Exceed Posted Speed Limit�, the author faces many obstacles because of the different terrain changes on his journey to Yosemite National Park. Taking advice from a group of old men, he headed to his first stop. The old men said he would see a town but what he really saw was a sort of ruined ""ghost"" town. Then he came to a fork in the road and was running out of water. He had been riding on flat road when the terrain dramatically changed. It became hilly and very inconsistent. This sudden change in terrain caused him to get more tired, thirsty, and hot. The cyclist then came to a huge hill and, using his last bit of energy, rode down. He was exhausted. All the terrain changes not only changed the cyclist�s physical state, but his mood and determination as well.  "	3	2		3																					
1689	3	You came alway choose your features because you idea mind be change over time.	0	0		0																					
1694	3	Many things in the setting affect the cyclist. The first thing that affects him is the heat. The heat is actually what causes the conflict in the story of the cyclist needing water. If the heat was not present in the story than the cyclist would not have such a need for water and he would be able to continue on his ride without fear of dehydration. Another aspect of the setting that affect the cyclist are the rolling hills. These hills also exhaust the cyclist and cause him to need more water. If these hills were gone than the cyclist would have tirerd less quickly making his journey easyer. The setting in this story greatly affects the cyclist.	2	1		2																					
1698	3	"Every body experiences physical and emotional pain, but most probably wouldn't have survived what the cyclist in this story went through. The man started a bike ride Yosemite National park, but when some eldrerly men told him a short cut, his adventure had just because. First at all, every ""town""and ""building"" the men told him he would come to, would come to, wound up being completely desserted. At first this wasn't a big deal to the cyclist. In the fourth paragraph when he came to his first desserted town he, ""chuckled, checked [his] water town supply, and moved."" @CAPS1, as his journey progressed, his water decreased.He was then in desperation for a town.On topof thatin the story he wrote, ''the tast roadwas replaced short, rolling hills. ""This made his biking harder and he was then becoming denyarated. He finally found a town with water, but learned his lesson from taking advice from strangers and old men. "	3	3		3																					
1699	3	"The features of the setting would have affected the cyclist a lot. There is a man who takes the advice of old men and takes a �shortcut� to Yosemite Park. The shortcut only leads him to thirst, and no park. The narration states, �A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth couldstill be seen (Kurmaskie @NUM1). ""This feature could affect the cyclist by discouraging him. the cyclist comes to the first �town� but only finds yet again no water, and a picture of something that makes him more thirsty. It could also make him be more angry at the old men because they led him on this pointless journey. Another feature that @MONTH1 affect the cyclist is the lack of trees or shade. The only thing he could feel was the sun beating down on his back. The narration states, �Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.(Kurmaskie @NUM1).� This also makes the cyclist believe that old men do not know what they are talking about."	2	3		3																					
1700	3	"There are many features of the setting that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit,"" The time of year affected the cyclist because it�s mid June, @CAPS1 the region affected the cyclist because mid June in arizona is extremely hot and try. If it was in a more northern state in @DATE1 or I, ll it wouldn�t be as bad and you world not have the dance of a heat struggles. @CAPS1 when the terrain changed from flat to hills this affected him because it made it harder for him the to ride. These are some features of the settings that affected the cyclist in ""Do not exceed the posted speed limit."""	1	1		1																					
1701	3	In  rough raod ahead by Joe Kurmaskie the feature of the setting affected the cyclist. Because he was in the desert of California in June, he water supply was emicated and he came across a ghost town. His hope was dwindling because of this. He found a water pump that produced a tar like substance as a result the desert and the lack of water made him wish he was dead he decided never to take advice from strangers and to trust his map. That is how the feature affected the setting.	2	2		2																					
1705	3	The setting effected the performence of the cyclist and the mood of the cyclist. The rolling hills the cyclist had to get over most likely made him more fined and thirsty because he had to put more effort in to get over them. �over one long, crippiling hill, a building came into view.� The long, big hills that he had to go up and made him more thirsty, but probably more satisfied when it was all over. Ironically, the building was a grape juice factory; abandoned and rusty, but the sigh featuring a boy drinking a refreshing glass of juice was still noticeable. This brought his hopes down. But continued to move on. In my life, I have never had such an experience to where I had to keep pushing and urging myself to my goal, but the closes I got, the more distractions got in the way to and stop me.	2	3		3																					
1706	3	�Do not exceed posted speed limit�, is a short story about a man who is bicycling through Yosemite and he asks some elderly men for direction and they lead him in this �old� shortcut that takes him through tough terrain and extreme famine. The features of the setting affect the cyclist in many ways throughout the story for example when the bicyclist came to a deserted area he said �there was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind�. By this time he was malnourished & in need of water this extreme thrist also reselted in him passing an abandoned Welch�s grape juice factory with an advertisement with a young boy pouring a fresh glass of juice in his mouth. He says �In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building,�, then he goes into detail about the building, this mood & feeling by this time was tired and worn out and the advertisement didn�t help the situation at all. The authors mood did change with the setting and before it got better it was worse.	3	2		3																					
1710	3	The story �Rough road ahead: do not exceed posted, speed limit � tells of a biking trip gone wrong. But the story would  not be as terrifying if it had happend in a different place. The setting plays a large role in the story. The story begins on a present summer evening but as the man bikes he arrives at ghost town devold of evil life, later feeling of double sets In when he arrives at �one ramshockle shed, severall rusty pumps and a corrol that couldn�t hold these lamest mule. � later we fear panic set in as these terrain becomes hilly and tumbleweeds and snakes cross the path. Like an cold wesstern. Finally all  hope is lost when he reaches these grapes Juice factory and fInd, �a sand blasted picture of a Young boy, � The setting is a power full tool which greatly influences the cyclist.  	2	2		2																					
1711	3	"In the story, �Rough Road Ahead: Do not exceed posted speed limit,"" by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of the setting affected they cyclists physical abilities. The features affected is abilities, because the climate and dangerous environment was hot and rough to handle. These features were hot and rough 'Since he was in the California deserts in June. The passage that supports this is,�. Tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake- it really did look like a diamondback- blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. Also, the features of the setting give him determination. They give him determination, because each horizon he sees gives him hope. They give him hope since he knows he is that much @NUM1 to Yosemite National Park. The passage that supports this is when he drops,"".distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that @CAPS1 could move it that far, I�d be fine.� In the story,"" Rough road ahead, Do not exceed posted speed limit, by Joe Kurmaskie, the features of his settings affect both they cyclists physical and mental abilities"	2	3		3																					
1720	3	The features of the setting very much affect the cyclist. He had to ride through tough conditions and became very exhausted. I believe the toughest feature of the setting was the heat. He told us, �I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June.�  He was talking about how he needed to sip from his water more than normally. Another tough feature of the setting was the hills he had to ride up and down. As he was riding he said, �Flat road was replace by short, rolling hills.� I believe riding over these hills in the hot @DATE1 in a California desert was a very tough task for the cyclist. I believe the terrain very much affected him.	2	3		3																					
1729	4	The author concludes the story with that passage to show the importance of the inspiration Saeng gets from the hibiscus plant. Saeng, throughout the story was comforted by the hibiscus plant because it reminded her of home. The plant during the winter metaphorically explains: @CAPS1 attitude towards her new country and her driving test; the hibiscus plant in the winter is not as beautiful in the bitter cold, but it adapts and survives, and returns to its beautiful state in the spring. Saeng is bitter about her new country and driving test, but is adapting, and will be inspired by the beautiful state of the hibiscus in the spring to try her test again. In conclusion, the author ended the story in that way to stress importance in the relationship between Saeng and the hibiscus plant.	3	2		3																					
1740	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show a sense of determination that Saeng posesses. When Saeng comes back and shows her mother the hibiscus plant, she is very upset, with tears in her eyes.Her mother at first is disappointed in her for buying the plant, but is then understanding when she realizes that Saeng was distraught. The mother offers to help Saeng plant the hibiscus, which comforts Saeng a little bit, helping her gain the determination she needs to recover. The story says �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This quote states that Saeng realizes that things at home can be the same as things in her new country. The author uses the term �familiar� to express that Saeng is starting to accept the fact that some things @MONTH1 be different, but she will eventually get used to it, making her view on life more positive.  	2	2		2																					
1743	4	I believe the author concludes the story with Saeng because it shows when she is reminded of home. I believe she thought she could pass the test when the flower was blooming and reminded her of home. For example, Saeng mumbled, �Not like the kind we had before.� This suggest to me that she was probably home sick. Then when spring comes and it blooms the flower could give her the strength to pass the test. This is why I believe the author ended with this paragraph.	2	1		2																					
1752	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, the author ends with the last specified paragraph, �When they came back�then I will take that test again.� because it leaves many un-answered questions the reader might have. The reader then might want to read her next piece of work. Basically, the last paragraph drows attention to the reader. many of the unanswered questions revolve around, �I failed the test.�. We also do not know �her gentle grandmother�, �mrs.Lambert�, and �home�. Another reason the author might end the story with that paragraph is to have a effect on the reader. The reader is left to only assume and imagine what things are to come. Will she pass the test? Will she go home? What will happen? All we know is, �when the snow melts, and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� most likely the author ended the story with the paragraph for dramatic effect for the reader. This is why, I believe the author of �Winter Hibiscus� ended with the specified paragraph.	1	2		2																					
1754	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how everything is changing and adapting to the change. Saeng decides that with this change, she can also adapt to her new life by going back and passing the drivers test. The hibiscus also represents how something also from her homeland has come to america and must now survive. When it begins to bud, Saeng will begin to start adapting to america by passing her drivers test. It�s all about trying to become accustomed to changes. When Saeng feels bad for failing, that�s why something from her past is such a comfort to her.	2	2		2																					
1757	4	The concluding paragraph explains her next goal. She had to take a test but failed it. Paid over nineteen dollars for the plant. It reminded her of her old home. She will have confident in the spring because the plant grew to its new home so she will grow to her new home also.	2	2		2																					
1759	4	The author concludes the story, �winter hibiscus,� with this paragraph of the story, for several relevant reasons. By concluding the story, in this way it shows Saeng�s growth, and more willingness to strive, and do her best. When she says she will take the test again, it shows her gain of confidence, and her beginning to gain comfort in the place that is not her home country. She is now striving and working toward doing her best to become successful. And she is making the very best of the given situation. The author is trying to give more depth and meaning to the study in this way. Saeng went from being nervous and worried when saying, �I-I failed the test,� to now setting a goal for herself to take it again, the time the bud blooms next year. Basically, the author did a full circle, by ending the story in this way. From speaking of the test, to sharing the flower experience with her mother, to state that she will re-take the test, next year. 	3	2		3																					
1760	4	The auther concludes with that paragraph because. it shows that despite her sorrow and discomfort, Saeng is able to remain hopeful. In the story, Saeng sees a hibiscus which makes her very homesick for her native country of Vietnam. The reader also leans that she failed a test and feels at of place. However, the hibiscus symbolizes hope and comfort. The auther chooses to conclude with that paragraph because despite Saeng�s hardships, the hibiscus helps her realize that she can overcome he obstacles and be hopeful of the future.	2	2		2																					
1765	4	the author added that sentence to the story to show how much Saeng cared about the snow and the plants. She says that she much rather do gardening then school work. She loves planting new things.	0	0		0																					
1766	4	The reason why the  author concludes the story with that paragraph is because it shows that saeng is starting to expect the new place she is in. Throughout  the story it says how she feels out of place just like the � winter hibiscus�. Then later in the story she says how ,�many of the things that she thought of as strange before had become , through quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now .� That quote means that most things she thought of as strange she is now getting used to slowly, which means is adapting. So, the reason why she says the last paragraph is to show that when everything changes back to spring the geese come back, and the hibiscus is budding ,�then she will take that test again.�therefore  the author puts the conclusion on the story because it shows how  she will adapt as well as the hibiscus.  	3	2		3																					
1775	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows how much Saeng has grow because of this experience, and how determined she is. This last paragraph afters a sudden happy ending to a rather sad story, but gives the reader role knowing the mom character is confident enough to try again. The whole story was filled with sadness about Saeng�s family having to move to a new country and start all over. However, the one thing that acts as an escape for them, is their gardening. In Vietnam, they seemed to have a nice garden and enjoyed having with it very much. Now that their in @LOCATION2, their garden and the plants in it remind them of that homeland, and how there life used to be. Although saddened by not passing her driving test, Saeng finds a plant that makes her happy and seems to rejuvinate her how of passing the test. The final paragraph seals the deal, as it shows that she is again confident in herself because of the happy memories that she is thinking about.	3	2		3																					
1777	4	"I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because Saeng is saying when the good time came back around she will try for the test again because She had failed it. for example on page @NUM1 at the top She "" I-I falled the test"" thats why i think the author concludes this with the Story because it was important to Saeng to past the test in the good time of season Spring. "	1	1		1																					
1782	4	The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.The author concludes the story with this to mean that when everything is back to normal and beautiful that when Saeng will take the test. She did this to show that Saeng is a spring person and that she likes working in the garden in the spring. Also it means that Saeng feels that she does better in school during the spring time.	1	1		1																					
1783	4	Change and disappointment are enough to over-come. Some people have an arid fear of change. For Saeng the main character from �winter Hibiscus,� change comes in the form of a move to @LOCATION1. Everything around her is different and new. Coupled with disappointment of failing her driver's exam, the feeling of living helpless overwhelms her. After buying a winter hibiscus plant, she vows to take the test again when it blooms in the spring. The resiliance of the winter flower and the memories it represents inspire seng to try again.	2	3		3																					
1793	4	The author concludes the story with in the spring when the snows melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is  budding then I will take that test again, because she is saying there will be a new year. For example he failed it the first time she will wait until she tries again. Another example she just want to try until she get her driving license.	1	1		1																					
1797	4	Hope, a new beginning, adjustment-all are reasons why the speaker concludes by saying �when they come back, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� That hibiscus flower gives that girl hope because it remind her of her grandmother and back home, how wonderful things were back there, and by the flower blooming, she realize it could wear out there too. She�ll also have a new beging in the spring, by spring she should adjust to her surrounding and have new friends, things to do, and new memories to look back on, that looking backabout flawall won't be as bad the flower will bring her hope and comfort with her adjustment.	2	2		2																					
1799	4	The author ends the story with this conclusion to show that @PERSON1 is very passionate about connecting her life in the United States, to how life was in Vietnam and bringing them together somehow. In the story, @PERSON1 talks about how she misses home and how she is still trying to adapt to her new life away from the home she knew, when saeng says that she has failed the test and wants to take it again, she means that she wants to show that she can survive in the United States without disappointing her mother. When saeng spent @MONEY1 on a plant, her mom was in disbelief because Saeng knows how hard it is to survive. When the conclusion says,�I will take the test again,� it shows that Saeng is willing try to make it in the United States from Vietnam, proving that she can make a better life for herself and her family by working hard. While still keeping trditions in Vietnam alive. Saeng simply wanted to make her new home feel like Vietnam by buying a plant she knew her mother would like.	2	2		2																					
1804	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that saeng is going to accept her new home and reconize the similarities from her old home and hold memories close to help her overcome obstacles that she is facing in life. ""I've seen this kind blooming along the lake. It's flowers arn't as pretty, but it`s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That's what matters.� This sets similarities from their old home to their new home. This shows that things do change but they are also the same. This leads to the conclusion because this is where Saeng relizes that she will always have the memories of her old home and will use them to help her overcome the troubles shes going through.  "	2	2		2																					
1805	4	The author ends the story the way she did to show how Saeng and the hibiscus plant are a like and how Saeng will overcome her obstacle when the plant overcomes its obstacle. Saeng�s obstacle is adjusting to her new life and the first step in that is passing her driver�s test. The reader knows she has to pass because Saeng tells her mother , �I-I failed the @NUM1]. The hibiscus must make it through the winter, it also has to adjust to new surrounding to survive, just like Saeng. The mother says to Saeng,�� but its strong enough to make it through the cold month here, this winter hibiscus.Thats what matter �[@NUM2]. So,if the winter hibiscus� job, or hurdle that it has to jump,it to make it, to stay alive during the winter months, then its job will be done in the spring. The author ends the story with Saeng telling herself, �� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�[@NUM2]. If Saeng�s obstacle is completing, and passing the driver�s test, and she passes in the spring, right as the hibiscus passes it�s �test� , the symbolism between the two, showing a determined spirits to adopt, will grow deeper because that will adopt and pass their obstacle at the same time.	3	3		3																					
1808	4	"The author ends the story with that paragraph, to give an unsight on the next story. I think there will be another story because there are clue to support my theory. Just at the beginning of the paragraph at just when they come back. Then at the end at stay ""then I will take the test again. I dint stay happily ever after at anything similar its that at just stated those personally changes mentioned. So I think what the author will write another story so we could see if Saeng will pass her test.   "	1	1		1																					
1815	4	The author  concludes  the  story  with  that  paragraph because its telling / showing  us  that  Saeng  is  going   to  try to pass  the  test  in the spring  . Getting  that  hibiscus  reminded  her  of  her   homeland  and  it  gave  her  memories of  then . And  it also made her believe  in herself and want to get there and  try  again . If made her  hopeful . The author  test in � when snow melts  and  the  geese  return  and this hibiscus is budding � to help indicate  that  its going  to  be  spring  when  she  trys  to take  her test  again.	2	2		2																					
1819	4	After Saeng fails her driver�s test, she gives up hope for the future. The sight of the hibiscus plant reminds her to never give up, no matter how tough the situation. In the story, Saeng�s mother says, �Its flowers aren�t as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matters.� This quote shows how even though its not an object of beauty, it can do what it takes to survive. Saeng feels that she is also like the hibiscus, having the strength to be able to survive in a new environment. Even though she is new to this country, Saeng had proved that no matter how big the situation, anything can be overcomed if you believe in yourself and your family.	2	3		3																					
1822	4	She concludes with this the story this paragraph because she wants @DATE1 to come again. She says �when the snow melts�. She wants to look at the events again. and take care of them.	0	0		0																					
1830	4	The author concluds the story with this paragraph because he knows all of this stuff going on will probley def come back up again. Just like how he said the geese, will geese  come back every year, so he is def saying that off of this will com back up. That is what I think.	1	1		1																					
1832	4	The author's conclusion to the story shows how Saeng interpreted the experience of that day. She uses a spring time setting to show when her confidence in herself is reborn. Seeing her hibiscus bud in the spring will giver herself and newfound integrity to go try that driving test again.	1	2		2																					
1842	4	The author concludes the story with This paragraph because it�s related to she thinks, when her semile of welcome warmed Saeng �cheep skip over live to you�re back she saw cheerfully� @CAPS1 it�s past time what took you so long? now did it go? Did you? She feels very skip over its related to	0	0		0																					
1846	4	The authoR concludes the stoRy with this paRagRaph because he is saying that Saeng likes to do thing in the spring when she sees flowers gRowing because she feels like she is at home, so she feel moRe confident. about passing the test.	1	1		1																					
1851	4	The author choose to end the story with that paragraph for emotional meanings. The last paragraph is saying she will re-take the test when the hibiscus is blooming in the spring. She hopes that the blooming hibiscus will give her strength to pass the test. The hibiscus reminds her of her homeland and gives her comfort. Saeng hopes the sight of the blooming hibiscus will remind her of her home and give her strength to pass the test.	2	1		2																					
1855	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it makes the story longer and it gives it a good ending but I have no idea on what that means so the author should explain what it means not me.	0	0		0																					
1859	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow�� to show that Saeng got stronger. She got, stronger because she adjusted to her new home and new environment. Saeng is more confident in herself to take the test again. She doesn�t want to cry again, like she did in her last test. Being more confident and more adjusted is the reason why she has become stronger, and the reason why she wants to take the test again is because she is stronger.	2	2		2																					
1860	4	Confidence, persistance, memories � all things that Saeng has �that helps explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph since Saeng moved from her own country, she has not been very happy, she was upset pretty much the whole time and misses everyone and @CAPS1 from Vietnam; @CAPS1 she sees reminds her of it, that last paragraph, where it says, �then I will take that test again,� shows that she has confidence in herself and wants to try harder next time. She shows persistence when she says she will try again and hopefully, she won�t give up, Saeng misses almost @CAPS1 from Vietnam, even the food. She also misses her family and how they look and dress. Her memories were probably hold her back from concentrating hard on her drivers test, she knows she wanted to do good so she bought the flower in hopes that would make her feel better. Hopefully, Saeng�s life will get better in the United states and she will learn to love this country.	1	2		2																					
1861	4	Because withe the blooming of the hibiscuse plant comes new hope. In the story she sees the hibiscuse as her old life and with the budding of the plant starts a new chapter in the young girls life.	1	1		1																					
1862	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because he�s trying to prove his point. I think that Saeng was comparing herself to the flower. For example the flower was originally a wild flower and then and then it was planted in a pot. Saeng was free happy girl but then she had to move to @LOCATION1. Both the flower and Saeng feel like they are out of place. Since in the story Saeng is similar to the flower then at the end then at the end of the story I think that Saeng thinks that if the flower can survive the winter then she can survive @LOCATION1 and she can pass the test. This is why I think that the author finished with that paragraph to get his message across.	3	2		3																					
1863	4	The reason why the author concludes the story like that is because he or she wants to show Saeng is determined to not fail that drivers test. The author wants to leave Saeng on a good note so she wont be sad. When she takes the test again shell be better prepared and know what shes expecting. Shell have a better winter.	1	1		1																					
1864	4	I think the author concludes the story as he or she did to teach a lesson. No matter what stands in your way or no matter what slows you down never give up. You should keep on trying. If you fail something, try again and again until you get it right.	1	1		1																					
1872	4	The author concludes this story with the promise Saeng made to herself to take the test again, come springtime, because Saeng is having trouble adapting to her new home, and she won�t give up on fitting in after only one failure. Remembering her home and that she will never be able to return are painful thoughts to Saeng and memories of it help her cope with her loss. The hibiscus and other familiar flowers she found comforted her, because they reminded her of home. At springtime when the geese return and the hibiscus starts blooming, Saeng will feel ready again to take the test, the spring represents the chance for another try, and a new beginning.	2	2		2																					
1877	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. In this story it about a @PERSON1, a girl and her mother. The girl is given money to buy a plant seeds. She spend @MONEY1 on this plant. Her mother get upset, but every thing turn on it, lk they had egg omlets with bits of melon.	1	1		1																					
1881	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show she has hope. She believes that she can pass the test when everything is back to normal, in the spring. In the spring the geese will return and the hibiscus will be budding. This makes her feel more at home because it was always like this before she moved. Also she likes the geese and the hibiscus and these things might make her feel more comfortable. This is why the author concludes the story with the paragraph to show she has hope.	1	2		2																					
1883	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show saeng�s determination to adapt to the change in her life. In the story saeng fails her drivers test and is struggling to adapt to her new life in @LOCATION1. However, when she sees that the hibiscus and geese are familiar, she is determined to adopt as well. Saeng buys a hibiscus because it reminds her of home. This not only comforts her it also makes her miss her old home more. The hibiscus can survive in both @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION1, so it helps saeng realize that she can as well. The author includes the geese because they help saeng realize that she is becaming more familiar with things in the United states, so she can continue to adapt. Saeng says that she now recognizes the �V� shape of the geese. Realizing that she is becoming more accostomed to @LOCATION1 and she is able to survive helps her reach the determination to retake and pass her driving test. The author includes it to summarize the story theme of adopting to change.	3	3		3																					
1884	4	I think that the author put that sentence to get a little personal with the character so you can relate to that person.	0	0		0																					
1885	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show the importance of new beginnings and to accentuate the theme in the story. The theme is that one must overcome hardships and seek new beginnings. The springtime is a representation of a new beginning. So, the new beginning of spring will allow her to start all over again on the drivers� test. Also, the author uses the paragraph to show the symbolic qualities of everyday things. Just how the hibiscus reminded her of home life, the geese will remind her of springtime.	2	2		2																					
1891	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� by �Minfong Ho� she ends the story by saying, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. �I-I failed the test�. As many kids do, Saeng failed her driving test and she is crucially upset about it. nobody wants to fail at something and it is almost a humiliating experience to have failed at a test. knowing that others have already successfully passed. With the quote in the introduction paragraph, or the one in the question, it was written as a sign of symbolism. When the geese return back north, it is to show that they are ready to �start over� again or to �try again�. When the hibiscus is budding it is trying to �start life� again. Saeng seeing objects doing things over and over again empowers her to want to succeed and try again. She realizes it is just a part of life and that in order to succeed you have to fail. Minfong concludes with that quote because she understands that no matter what the obstacle, you must press forward and keep trying in order to succeed. She realizes success can only come from hard work and commitment, and that that is what makes a great, strong individual.	2	3		3																					
1898	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she is comforted by the memories of her homeland and really appreciates the beauty of tropical plants. She believes that since it is winter and the hibiscus is not budding, that cannot pass the test until it is. �almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the thing that she had thought of before had become through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. �This shows how much she really does believe in the beauty of her homeland and the tropical plants because she is thinking back to other times where things have been strange during the winter and better in the spring and @DATE2 seasons when the plants are budding, so she believes that she will actually pass the drivers test when she feel comfortable, when the plants have budded.	2	2		2																					
1903	4	The last sentence of a story is usually the most meaningfull. I believe the author ended the story this way for many reasons. For example, I think the author did this to leave the reader with a strong sense of determination. The story quotes, �I will take that test again.� By use of the word will, the author shows the girls determination. She didn�t say she would try to, she said she will, without a doubt. I also think the author ended this way to emphasize the theme of new begginigs. The story quotes, �when they come back... in the spring... I will take that test again. This shows that in spring, the new begginig of life she will take the test. This is why I believe the author ended the story this way.	2	2		2																					
1904	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus� made a good choice to conclude the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus  is budding, then I will take that test again.� This paragraph hints to the reader that Saeng intends to combine her new and old lives. Her old life is represented by the hibiscus; she used to the constants from back home. The geese symbolize her new life; they have become �almost familiar to her now� The obstacle she faces is passing the driving test. The author implies that in the spring, when the old and new parts of Saeng�s life are combined, Saeng will be able to overcome her �obstacle,� and all will be well. With the geese in the ground, Saeng�s life will have come full circle.	3	3		3																					
1908	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho. The author expresses how the girl believes with her memories and once she changes and adapts to the culture that�s when she will have the courage to re take the test she failed that day. Saeng misses her home so much and she can�t grasp that their are similarities between her new home to her old home. �She realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familar to her now�. Saeng didn�t want to expect the move but noticeing that she won�t forget any memories she starts to take on new memories. At first everything was so different now she is starting to remember things about her new home which is a sign of comfort to her. �She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again."" With Saeng�s feelings of the change the ending paragraph lets the reader know that there is hope for moving on her knew home. She is gradually starting to gain confidence and she knows when she does she can take her test an succeed at it. The author shows how good change can be if your willing to adapt. Everything might not always be as perfect as you know it to be but your courage will make a happy home with new and old memories, As Saeng starts to relize during the last paragraph."	1	1		1																					
1914	4	Saeng feels more comfirtable in the spring because it reminds her of home. She probably never experienced snow or winter before. So nothing in this time of year reminds her of home. In the spring it does because the geese return and the hibiscus grow again making everything feel like its her home again. Conferdence is what she receives when spring comes again. 	1	1		1																					
1925	4	The author choose this end to show that saeng hasn't given up on how she is living yet. It shows that even though she really loved her hometown, and feels and remembers a lot back then. She had taken the test and failed, living where she was living then just seemed too much pressure on her. Although she hasn't quite adapted throughly she will try her best to surcome situations that are brought upon her. It gives the reader hope by ending the story like this, instead of just leaving the reader at she bought a flower after failing a test and moves on with her life. For example when she failed the test she seemed distressed and very angry. I,�I-I failed the test,� Saeng said. For a long moment mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shedding it to bits.�it anger Saeng how she had to leave her happy past life for one that is different and challenging. When faced with a challenge extreme emotiona situations occur. Saeng just needed hope and the author choose this to betray to then reader there is a chance of hope!	3	3		3																					
1930	4	She vowed this because just as the geese would return she shall. also as the test themselves to learn and grow she would. Furthermore she @CAPS1 the the test of love, survial and family tridition she would know that comeing. back was destiny. In example they come to raise their young for the journey that they shall face and Help them to  realise that they always will come back because their lives started there and to always exacpe cold and man kind that wants to harm their lives. The winter months are very harsh there so They know that they have to leave just to @CAPS2. She learns the lessons of family, freedom, life, and survival.	1	1		1																					
1936	4	The author concluded like that because he was the one to score the lines below what you write. Score of to level and key better. To all the thing he was surprised to kindly be seprated by for there by up so blese geve one a high sew o of will sweit all at you up to the end of the authrs concludes 	0	0		0																					
1944	4	"The author might have concluded the story with that paragraph, because she wanted to remind the reader how sincearl, ""Saeng"" was to the hibiscus flower. I say this because through out the story @PERSON1 was very compassionate about the flower. I think she felt as through she could relate to the flower."	1	1		1																					
1947	4	"Minfong Ho ended her story ""Winter Hibiscus"" with an optomistic sentence. She concluded it this way because the main character of the story was beginning to lose hope. Saeng decided to retake the driving test when her hibiscus flower was blooming. This flower reminds her of her past life in Vietnam with her grandmother. ""Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother's long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb"". She preferred her life in Vietnam than hers in @LOCATION2. She was goint to wait until ""this hibiscus is budding,"" so she can feel more comfortable and happy. The author wanted to end it so Saeng would be happy. "	2	2		2																					
1949	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph in order to develop the theme and to project what the main character will do after she plants the hibiscus, I believe that the theme of this story is adjusting to changes in life and the author builds upon this theme in the final paragraph. In the ending paragraph, the author writes, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author demonstrates how Saeng learns to adjust when things change in her life. In this instance, Saeng fails her driver�s test and to deal with this setback, she buys a hibiscus to remind her of her homeland. The hibiscus symbolizes a new start test once the geese ??? (THIS @CAPS1 IS @CAPS2)	2	2		2																					
1957	4	He concluded the story with that sentence because it told that she learned a lesson in life. all the way back home where she originally came from she missed her friends ibet and seeing her mother work out in the garden durring this time of year when its cold. I guess there poor in one way. In conclusion the choose this sentence because it sounds like she learned a lesson in life and even starting all over again but with a better understanding in her learning.	1	1		1																					
1958	4	Saeng says this in the paragraph because she wants to make her mother proud of her so she is going to take the test again after winter.	1	1		1																					
1962	4	"The author chose to conclude the paragraph with the sentence ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring , when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" because it shows how the strenghth of the hibiscus is related to Saeng's strenghth. In the story, after failing her drivers test, Saeng @CAPS1 comfort in a hibiscus native to her country. when she gets home her mother says �I�ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren't as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here."" This shows that saeng is faltiering in her new foriegn country. The end quote sums up that saeng @CAPS1 strenghth in the strenghth of the flowers. almost thinking if flower can survive in a land away from its home, why can't I?"""	3	2		3																					
1967	4	"In the last paragraph of ""Winter Hibiscus"" by minfong Ho The author concludes by saying  ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"". I think the author concludes with this quote because it shows her determination to overcome this obstacle, For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort and the ability to over come. Saeng is very strong and she believes off of that determination which comes from her past. The author concluded with that because it shows Saeng�s determination."	2	1		2																					
1968	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho the author ends the story it that paragraph to show how meaningful that flower is to Saeng. The text stated, ""@CAPS1 in the garden, Saeng dig out a hole and carefully lowered the ""winter Hibiscus"" into it."" This shows the reader that it is very meaningful to Saeng to have this plant in her garden. Also by having that conclusion statement it help the reader understand the affection of her new country. Also the conclusion paragraph shows comfort at a time of disappointment. In the story it said, ""Its flowers aren't as pretty, but it's strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. This also shows the connection of Saeng and the flower and how it helps her through everything."	2	2		2																					
1970	4	"I believe that the author ended the story with this line to show that hope for the girl was still there and that even perhaps the flower had inspired her a lot. I believe that when she says ""when they come back, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again"", She specifically chose this time for her to start over, and try again just as everything else mentioned is. When it says, ""and this hibiscus is budding"", it shows that the flower is blooming again, with a fresh start and beginning again just as she would try to do when she tries again to succed at passing the test she must pass. also the tone of which said said this showed hope, she was hopeful and determined that next time around she would certainly pass."	2	3		3																					
1974	4	"From the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the author concludes this story with the paragraph of what Saeng vowed silently because it is to show Saeng�s determination. The hibiscus was the plant she found, that was closly resembled the one at �home,� to symbolize her conformt. The hibiscus symbolized her determination in life. �through the quiet repetiton of season upon season, almost familiar to her now� from this, you can conclude that Saeng is thinking of how she reconignzed the geese. It gives her greater confidence within herself. From this, �like the Geese she lifited her head and watched as their distinctive v was etched,"" and this explains that there is still hope inside of her. This paragraph conclusion the author had concluded ties together what Saeng is now hoping and believing in."	2	2		2																					
1977	4	The Author concludes the story with this When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is building then I will take that test again! because he or she are the ones who wrote the story. One information is her family moved to the united @ORGANIZATION1 from Vietnam. Second one is the Author could of made this story it was about her. Saeng fails her driving test.    	1	1		1																					
1979	4	The author shows a willingness to try harder in this story. She states that, �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think the author realizes that she is going to have to adapt. Also, saying that she will wait till the spring, means she is going to try again, and not give up. The author has a sentimental value to. Insince she is waiting for the hibiscus to bud, I believe she is referring that hibiscus to her country. Insince she has left her country, the hibiscus is the closet thing she has to it, and therefore, she will wait with the flower	2	2		2																					
1983	4	I think the auther concludes the story with the paragraph because it is saying I�ll never give up. She is determined to concor everything. I think she is saying she will take the test over and over until she succeeds. That is why the author concludes the story with this paragraph because you should never give up.	1	1		1																					
1985	4	"In the story �Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes in a way to relate back to the beginning conflict of the main character , failing her driver�s test.The author does this to bring the reader back and yet helps the reader foreshadow in whats going on to happen in the future, ""in the spring ,when the snowS melt and the geese return and hibiscus budding, then I will take the test again."" @CAPS1 with this sentence  informs the reader that with the help of a plant similar to those at her homeland it will help her move on .When the hibiscus is makeing a new start by budding in the spring Saeng will do the same ,by retaking her drivers test.With this as a conclusion that author therefore is not leaving the reader confused about �What happened with the driver�s test ,what was the point of that ?�."	2	2		2																					
1986	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to inform what her hole meaning was. For example when she returned she felt great b/c she came back to were she belonged. One reason is what she �vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding.� @CAPS1 meant that coming back was probably the best thing she could had done.	1	1		1																					
1987	4	well It seems like to me that the reason why the author wrote that as his or her ending is because basically to have sarcaism and put emphesis on what he was saying and making it clear that he wasn't going to take the test again, and basically if some one would haft to kill him in order to make him take that test again.	0	0		0																					
1993	4	The author includes that seterel paragraph because they wanted you to be able to visualize it in yor head rather than not seeing the picture. If you see a mental picture then it�s good at visualizeing.	0	0		0																					
1995	4	"The story Winter Hibiscus by @CAPS1 Ho the author concludes the story with  ,�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and hibiscus is budding ,then I will take that test again"". The author does this as a symbol of hope for the reader. Also so its not just an ending where you never know what happens it gives you something to forward to. Furthermore when the geese do come back there is warm weather and the hibiscus is blommming then Saeng will be more comfortable because she has gotten use to idea of living a new place and has met more people. Meanwhile having the hibiscus in bloom will bring good memories back from when she was young and living in her homeland .This will help Saeng achieve her goal of passing her test .Also I believe  the author ended the story with that passage because it makes people want to read it again or recommend the story to someone else .I know that I hate reading stories  that just end and don�t  tell you what happens next . However the Author resolved this by letting the reader know that Saeng wants to pass the test and is going to go back and try again."	2	3		3																					
2013	4	Why the author concludes it because the author wants to show her that she won�t give up. that she will take the test again and try harder next time to overcome her challenge, and not give up. The author wants to show her, that she�s not a quitter, and she�s filled with determination even though she has conflicts.	1	1		1																					
2016	4	"I think the author chose to end the story the way he did because it shows determination to pass the test. The test was to be able to make the garden graw. You know this because it says �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This shows that the test she look had to do with spring and the budding of flowers and that she is trying to grow something. In this story, they mention her helping her mother in the garden. So I think when the plants didn�t grow, she wanted to try again. That�s why I think they chose to end with the statement saying about taking the test again in the spring."	1	2		2																					
2018	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to conclude all the things they talked about in the story. In the story they talk about the spring time and now Saeng and her mother plants flowers and everything.	0	0		0																					
2021	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph because that represents saeng�s decision to try again and to overcome obstacles in her way. It is used instead of her saying � I will try again next spring � to show diction and to show her goal or decision in a different way for example, It says �, Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season almost familiar now.� At first, geese flying in the sky was new to her, but now she�s use to it. Maybe the author is making a reference to the geese since it will be familiar (the driving test) and she will pass like she got use to and familiar with geese. Since her family came to @LOCATION1 from Vietnam, she�s been adjusting to changes in her life and to circumstances. But, Saeng seemed determined to survive and overcome it. The paragraph is saying simply that she�ll take the test again next spring, but the author put that paragraph there to show diction by emphasizing the geese, representing learning something new, and the hibiscus, something familiar. It overtones the point in the story, which is to not give up and the will to survive.	3	3		3

2024	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author ended the story with that particular paragraph to symbolize new beginnings. The story is all about the failure and shame felt by Saeng when she failed her driving test, and how finding a familiar hibiscus plant gave her a new lease on life. By buying the hibiscus, Saeng was reminded of her home, and by giving that single hibiscus a new, unfamiliar place to thrive in, as she was. She was able to make a connection with the plant. The spring symbolizes the beginning of a new year, and the budding hibiscus represents the start of its new life, and so Saeng wants to restart her life when the plant restarts its life and retaking her driving test.	3	3		3																					
2027	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by @PERSON1, a teenage girl; Saeng, and her family, have moved to united states from Vietnam. Saeng is walking home after failing her driver's test, and she passes a familiar plant. She then goes into a florist shop to purchase the plant. She arrives home and tells her mother she failed the test of course her mother is upset, but she makes dinner and the plant the �winter hibiscus� at the end of the story Saeng thinks to herself, �when they come back, in spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� I think Saeng says she will retake the test in spring because she feels confident and happy now that she is comfortable with the plant she has, and her mother isn't too mad at her. She feels that everything is going to be ok and she can retake the test in spring, when life is blooming.	3	2		3																					
2033	4	The whole story about Saeng buying the hibiscus is in response to her failing the driving test. This crushed her. She wants to be reminded of her old homeland where she did not read to past the driving lessons. So she goes to a green house to find plants that are similar to the ones she used to have in her homeland. She does this to try to make herself feel better but still �in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept.� Saeng feels she failed and the hibiscus gives her hope and memories of her old country. Her mom clearly sees and understands this when she doesn�t yell at Saeng for spending @NUM1$ on the plant. �I�m glad you got it,� Saeng�s mom says because she knows it comforts her daughter. Together the plant the hibiscus. By doing this they are planting Saeng�s hope to grow, not only to pass the driving test but to make it in the new country. *The story ends with those lines because Saeng decides if the hibiscus will grow then so will she. She will be ready to face the driving test with hope and support and because she adapted. *The hibiscus, although it is not the one she had in the old country, she knows they can adapt to their surroundings and so the plant has in the new country. The plant will grow if it can adapt. Saeng can grow if she adapts to this new country.	3	3		3																					
2039	4	They can compair the story and this statement to eachother because in the story the does not give up and the same thing with the test who even is taking to test again did not give up cause  they are taking it again.	1	1		1																					
2041	4	Minfong Ho concludes the story with this paragraph to show the change in saeng�s heart and attitude toward her new life in @LOCATION1 spring symbolize rebirth, the author doesn�t include this on accident. Spring will be saeng�s time of rebirth where she can take the test and restart her new life in @LOCATION1.�When the snow melts�is included because winter symbolizes death and when the snows melt a way so will saeng fears. 	2	2		2																					
2046	4	because she is confused and is not yet youst to the country she is in how so she can concentrat on her test as soon as the flower will plown because she feels more like home she thinks that she will do better on the test	1	1		1																					
2060	4	The author might of concluded the story with that sentence to show that she still cares about the test and not mostly about a meisly plant thats gonna die anyways. Also because she needs to pass the test and the author is putting in a getall that in the end the girl is gonna pass and not have to re-take that test all over again. but also he/she tells that because he/she wants us to know that it aint all about other things that are expensive in life but that school is really more important than anything basically.	1	1		1																					
2063	4	The author concludes the story with Saeng vowel to show a sense of change in Saeng. The winter time is very brutal like Saeng�s mum said but spring is when things come alive. I think is showing the sense in Saeng. Though winter is tough and you @MONTH1 get them trown around by the wind. When spring comes she will try the test again and come to life and enjoy the @LOCATION1 even thagh that she is far from rain. The author did the right thing to conclude the story with that vowel. 	1	1		1																					
2064	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he is trying to say whenever something leaves their home they always come back. The hibiscus reminds her of home and that is where she wants to go. Saeng had failed her drivers test and she said when the geese come back I will do it again. The plant reminds her of home but its, �Not like the tird we had before� (Ho). She is trying to say that the ones over at Vietnam are better and she wants to go back because she misses it.	1	1		1																					
2068	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show maybe by this time she will be comfortable with her new home. I know this because when I moved i didn�t like it because I didn�t have many friend but in like a year or two I was fine because I had a lot of friend. This is like Saeng because she misses her old home because she keeps talking about it then crying for example, when see saw the plant it was the one she had at her old home and she started crying because she missed it. In conclusion that is why he put that at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2071	4	I believe that the author chose to end with that paragraph because the paragraph represents new beginnings and starting over. When Saeng fails her driving test she has a moment of weakness, she feels lonely and then she sees a plant that reminds her of her home in Vietnam. In a since, the plant comforts her. �it�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here� In this quote Saeng�s mother tells her that the flower is too, out of place but yet has found the courage and determination to still grow. In the closing paragraph Saeng decides that, like the flower and the birds, she can also find the coarge to face fears. She deciedes to retake the tests.	2	2		2																					
2073	4	I belive the author was saying a new start. I say this because of everything coming back. I also say it because Saeng knows whats important now and will take it seriously. That is what I think the author was saying at the end of the story.	1	1		1																					
2074	4	During  �Winter  Hibiscus�  written  by  Minfong  Ho, a young  girl  and  her  mother   to  a new place,and the  daughter  Saeng  is  having a hard time.Saeng found a plant called dok faeng-noi that reminds her of home. So  she bought it and took it home to show her mom, At first her mother was upset, she bought a @NUM1 dollar plant but then hearing her daughter is disappointment in herself, she found joy in the beautiful plant, while Saeng�s mother was cooking dinner .Saeng planted the beautiful plant and told herself when the  geese return, hibiscus is budding and its spring she will retake the test. She found strength in herself and  courage  to  do  better.  I think the author wanted to show how she gained respect for herself in the end of the passage. That is why the author ended it like she did.   	1	2		2																					
2076	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus,� written by Minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to sum it at all up. The author used this to keep the reader wondering too.	1	1		1																					
2079	4	In the story the author concludes the story in his last paragraph because he showes that even in her hardships. Saeng goes on and keeps trying to live a normal life after she had to move. For example when it says, �Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring I will take the test again.� This shows that even after one failuare you should never give up but don`t forget the past.	1	1		1																					
2084	4	They used this sentence because she wants to see the flower bud and feels like she is at home again. Then she will take the test. She also will feel lucky and have a memory of home so saeng vowed silently to herself.	1	1		1																					
2086	4	After reading the about story, �Winter Hibiscus � by Minfong Ho, I believe the quote, �when they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus the budding, then  I will take that test again.� Was put in the story for a reason. I believe that this quote concluded the story because it ashamed a tone and feeling of hope. For example, in the story it state that �Saeng day out a hole and carefully lowered the plant into it�. This shows that this plant areas a lot to here. The story tell the readon that it things lack memories of her grandmother. It represents hope to Saeng because it always brings back happy memories she once had which push here to try to overcome the loss betters. Therefore, the quote concludes the story because it about Saeng will for hope and peace. It represent that when the plant blooms in the spring she will have a new found sense of hope and happiness.	2	2		2																					
2091	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph to show Saeng won�t give up & will keep trying. In the story all the memories of her old country encouraged her to be strong. For example the flower made her sad but in the end it made her better. Also in the beginning she didn�t really like new changes and she missed home, but at the end some of the same memories she had back home were in her new country. Those are the reasons I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph	2	2		2																					
2099	4	"In @CAPS1 Ho�s �Winter Hibiscus,� the author concludes the story with a meaningful paragraph. The author tries to make a message to saeng. When saeng saw the geese �slowly fading into the distance� she thought of herself. �When they come back"" Saeng will also come back to school. �the geese return and this hibiscus is budding� means that saeng will return to the school and be a new person. �This hibiscus is budding� states that saeng is still growing, just like the hibiscus. She will then take that test again� because it�s a new start for her and a new beginning. Spring is an archetype of rebirth and a new life. since the flowers will be growing and having a new life, so will saeng."	2	2		2																					
2104	4	I believe the author concluded the story with that paragraph to let readers known that Saeng is a survivor just like hibiscus. Saeng has not quite adapted to america and feels that this plant reminds her of home	1	1		1																					
2106	4	The concludes the sentence this way because their trying to show that Saeng is a very deterimined girl and no matter how many times she fails, she always trys again and again tell she gets it right. By doing this the author is showing what Saeng believes in and that is no matter how big or hard the chanellge is she will keep on going tell she is done what she started. Because moving was a very hard for her. She had a very hard time communicating with peolpe and just tyring to make friends cause it is not always easy be new, by moving she took a another look at things because they were different on her. But as time went by she got the hang of it so as long as you try you can be successful in it that�s what the author was trying to say by concluding it the way it was.	2	2		2																					
2107	4	In the story a young girl named saeng takes a test but she had falled. She is going to retake it next spring, thats why the last paragraph say; when then come Back, Saeng vowed  silently to herself, in the spring mum the snow melts and geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then l will take the test again the author concludes the story with this ending @CAPS1 in the story it talks about the hibiscus flowers so, since she failed the test instand  of saying she will retake it next spring they say when the hibiscus flowers bud @CAPS1 at that time it will be spring.	1	1		1																					
2108	4	The author concludes the story like that to let the readers know that the daughter saeng would come back and take the test again, she loves the Garden sotherefore she will not forget what spring did for her.	1	1		1																					
2109	4	It shows that she loves her plants. The story tells you all of the plants and how she likes them. She thinks they are all unique and that she enjoys the plants more than school or anything else.	0	0		0																					
2111	4	"In the story, @ORGANIZATION1, by Minfong Ho the aurthe concluldes the story with the last paragraph because he's trying to say when the flower comes back to life and starts a new beginning that Saeng will start a new beginning by retaking the test. For example, �Look how root - bound it is, poor thing"". The example is saying how the plant was almost died when she bought it. Another example would be, ""I-I failed the test"". The example tells how she feels down about failing the test. So In @CAPS1 the flower was at it's �breaking point"" as well as saeng. The paragraph tells how @CAPS2 was going to take a break and wait for the flower to being stronger till she toke the test again."	1	2		2																					
2112	4	The author added the last paragraph because Saeng�s vow helps the reader Saeng and her pain, but her optimism that things will get better. I translate the vow into when things start to be normal again it will get much better for her in this new country. The spring symbolizes normal because at home where she thinks is normal is covered with beautiful flowers, like spring. The snow melting would be the pain going away. The geese returning would symbolize that saeng knows things will get better like she knows the geese will be back in the spring. The hibiscus in the story has symbolized her home and her grandmother, which symbolize happiness, so she will be happier when things get better.	2	2		2																					
2116	4	The reason that the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because Saeng wants to do some thing good for herself. The reason I said this is cause in the last paragraph it says �Saeng vowed silently to herself �which means she wants what is best for herself.	1	1		1																					
2117	4	Saeng believes that because she failed the driving test that she won�t be able the transition by a new country had she goes searching for her past. She finds her past in plants remembering Vietnam in deep sorrow. The narration states  �A were of less so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eye��(No) She remembers and misses everything she had she wanted her country her grandmother and her life. She came home to her mother with a plant and disappoint her mother with the cost but she understands the pain. The narration states �it�s a beautiful plant she finally said in sad you got it�(No). Eventually Saeng realizes how this plant affected her and how easily it survived and made a promise to herself. The narration states �and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test agin   	2	3		3																					
2121	4	"Mingfong Ho concludes �Winter Hibiscus� with the paragraph,�when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" This ending paragraph shows that Saeng will not give up in her struggle to adapt in this new place. Saeng has been going throug hard times; moving to the United States and failing her driver�s test. In the greenhouse Saeng even breaks down and crys. The hibiscus flower that saeng bought cost the family a lot of money, but to Saeng it was very important. This flower represented hope. When the flower buds again it would be the right time to take her driver�s test. The flower also represents adapting to a new place. As Saeng  adapts to the United States, the hibiscus adapts to the new garden. "	2	3		3																					
2124	4	The Author concludes this story with that paragraph because she is saying that she could not concentrate on the test because she wanted to go back to her home country.	1	1		1																					
2129	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Forexample, It gives the Story a good and happe ending.	1	1		1																					
2131	4	The reason why he concludes this with this paragraph is because he is telling how the story ends. The reason behind that is so people know's what happens.	0	0		0																					
2133	4	She concludes the story with this paragraph because she want to let the readers of the story that she is not willing to give up and and that she is willing to take the test again and pass it.	1	1		1																					
2139	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when it snows plants die and won�t grow back until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding then she will she how her garden will be in the spring. Therefore the author put this paragraph in the end because Saeng loves gardening so much ever since she moved to the United States. Ever since the family moved to the United States the family has never been happier for being together having dinner and planting together they had the time of there life planting all the time.	1	1		1																					
2146	4	I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph to leave us with hope. Saeng is going to retake the test she failed. Saeng is having a hard time adjusting to her new life, by waiting until the snow melts, the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, Saeng gives herself time to adapt and heal. The paragraph show�s Saeng�s courage and hope about retaking the test.	1	1		1																					
2148	4	The author chooses to end the story with this paragraph to get across the theme of acceptance and determination. Saeng is very attached to the hibiscus plant because for her it represents her homeland and all the things she left behind. This last line represents many things. The snow melting, the geese returning, and the hibiscus budding all indicate a time of rebirth and new beginnings. The fact the Saeng wants to retake her test shows how obstacles can be overcome, and goals achieved	2	2		2																					
2158	4	This shows that she has not givven up and is going to try hard to adopte and do well in this new land. It leavs a sad story off with a happy ending. The hibiscus is a sigh of hope and so is spring, this makes the en time thing be fkor, without this part the story would be a sad one, but with it is one of hope. The way that the rest of the story is told is as if this is a turning point or an end to the en time boot. It is on resa lution without a resolution.	1	2		2																					
2171	4	The author ended this story with this sentence because it�s a good conclution. It�s a good conclution because it closes by telling what she will do. This is good  because it shows that Saeng had finally realized that she needs to take that test even though she likes nature so much.	0	0		0																					
2174	4	The author ends the story with the paragrap and because it is winter time and she can not do anything in the winter because of the snow. The snow made it so that she would have to take a test in the spring.	0	0		0																					
2181	4	The meaning of the last phrase is to see if the winter hibiscus canre seed and go threw everything to become a flower for the year and repeat the process. 	0	0		0																					
2185	4	I think he concludes his story with that paragraph because she know she was wrong and she want�s to make it up to her mother. Also she is showing her mother how much she really likes nature.	0	0		0																					
2191	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he basically saying hes never taking that test again. The author is showing that the character doesn�t like this test. And would rather not take it	0	0		0																					
2192	4	The author of the story ends it with a very interesting paragraph. This paragraph talks about over coming obstacles and is telling the reader to try again. It is important to never give up and to keep trying until you sucede. In the story Saeng had just moved away from Vietnam she really missed it, and on top of it saeng failed her drivers test. She was really upset. She saw a group of geese flying above her and said when they come back in the spring and my new plant starts to grow I will retake my drivers test. Geese have to overcome the cold by flying south for the winter. The cold weather is an obstacle for them. Also her new plant can't grow until its warm. Her plant has to over come being small until it can bud in the spring. People face obstacles all the time. You have to keep trying inorder to get around them.	3	3		3																					
2195	4	The author concludes that statement at  the story at the end of the story because he wants to show that Saeng wont give up just like the hibiscus.For example the hibiscus does its  best to survive in the winter and blooms and starts over in the spring.Saeng will also survive the winter and star all over again in the spring and retake the test. The author  wanted  to  show  the readers that Saeng is the hibiscus in a way that she has to start over and retry what she has failed as if the hibiscus had died in the winter.	2	2		2																					
2196	4	My response is that if is about winter so realy it is going to be about witer walking around having fun and all them thing.	0	0		0																					
2198	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because he wants to show that the flower was her inspiration to take the test before. The way I got my response was, throughout the story, @PERSON1 was always either gardening the hibiscus or had one. This obviously showed me that she was inspired by this flower and its beuty. In conclusion, the author ends the story like this to show the importance of the Hibiscus flower to Saeng.	1	1		1																					
2207	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt &the geese return & this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again. I think the author included this in the story to show that you shouldnt push things off. You should always deal wi them as they come up. So in the story the girl is showing a bad example. I believe the author wanted to make a point of not doing that. Overall, to add this phrase in this story was the right thing to do to try and show the right way of doing and going about these certain things	0	0		0																					
2209	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng will follow  nature  and  try to  fit  into her  new  land. Saeng  has failed  her  driver�s   test  and  feels  out  of place  in  her  new home. The text states, �As  Saebba  nedae  tall  and  lush. And  surrounded  there  garden� (No 1).When  she  sees  the @CAPS1 it reminds her of old home where she fit in.Now she  wants to wait to see  that flower  grown  so when she takes the driver�s test again.Also,she sees geese fly over her head when she plants he r flower. The  author  writes. ��She  realized  that  many  of  the  things that she had thought strange before  had become�almost  familiar  to  her how�(No @NUM1).The geese coming back in the spring will now  also  remind her  of  her  new  name  and  how  must  try  to  live  there happily now. In the last paragraph the  author writes,� I will take that test again�(No @NUM1).This gives the feeling of Saeng  trying to start a  new  beginning in this new home.  	3	3		3																					
2210	4	This is a powerful sentence that demonstrates themes in the story. Saeng is determined to try again because she has been comforted by symbol of her homeland. This sentence shows what the plant has done for Saeng�s spirit and shows how that symbol helps heal her. The sentence is able to wrap up the story and demonstrates the importance of the hibiscus. In the story @CAPS1 describes the plant as a friend and remmeder of her homeland. Once she sees the plant in bloom she`ll know that she can take the test again. The paragraph is a great conclusion to the passage because it summarizes everything that the hibiscus has meant for Saeng.	2	2		2																					
2213	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph to let the readers know that she doesnt give up. They @MONTH1 have thought that she thaght the test back home were more important. So she wouldnt care about passing this test because she misses her home and wouldnt care about those test.	1	1		1																					
2216	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�, I think that the author concludes the story in �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is dudding, then I will take that test again� because she has made Saeng feel that if that hibiscus can restart and make new flowers the Saeng should do the same. Therefore thats why the author added that quet to the end of the story	2	1		2																					
2220	4	The author ends the story with that paragraph because she wants to show that the peace that the peace that the flower gave will build her confidence and she will not give up. I know this because in the story the main character fails her driving test and when she sees the flower it helps remind her of the home she had in Vietnam. Another reason is because the flower blooms in spring and it never stops blooming. She knows it will never give up and she relaizes that she shouldn�t either. Plus the plant gives her stength to try again. So the reason the author ends her story with that paragraph is to show the power the flower that was know to her, give her and how she will no give up.	2	2		2																					
2221	4	The author concludes the story with this ending paragraph because. It combine the two inpefect situations. When she said when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snow melt and the gese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take test again. She will prove her point and abbreviated the situation.	0	0		0																					
2229	4	In the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� by Minfong Ho, the author�s final paragraph shows how much the hibiscus means to her. The author uses symbolism when, he talks about the hibiscus because it is a strong plant just like the girl needs to be to pass the driving test. The author put the paragraph at the end to show that if the hibiscus can come back, after winter, so can the girl. In conclusion, the author used the last paragraph to emphasize the meaning of the hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2234	4	Saeng wanted to show that she was strong and determined. She wanted to make the best of things with what she had. She had lost a lot of hope with the big move to another country. The winter made her sad longing even more for home. She bought the flower to, in a sence, bring her back home. When the spring comes, she will bud with the flower and take the test again. This is her new home with new hibiscus. After all, winter is no time for a flower.	1	2		2																					
2241	4	The story concludes with this paragraph for a number of reasons. First, in the spring it is warm and sunny and this helped to end the story in a happy note. Next this shows that Saeng can adapt to her new home, as the hibiscus will through winter. Finally, it shows Saeng is determined and won't let her mother down. That is why the story concludes with that paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2244	4	The response that the author concludes the story with this peragraph because  the author wanted us that read the story to understanding what was going on in the story. like for the @CAPS1 they was sayin when they come back Saeng vowed silently to herself in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibicus is budding then I will take that test again, was tryin to see where everybody head at in the story so they can understanding what the author be talkin about.	0	0		0																					
2246	4	The author included that paragraph because the hibiscus plant makes her think of where she is from and helps her to succeed a certain things. I know that the hibiscus is from her homeland because in the story she says �I mean, not like the kind we had at�at-�, she found that she was still to shaky to say the words at home.� She misses being home and this plant helps her bring back memorys of being there. Therefore the author included that paragraph to show the reader that she misses her homeland.	1	1		1																					
2250	4	In order to get over her failure, Saeng bought a flower that reminded her of home. Saeng�s started to cry when she bought the flower. She wanted to be back home. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to show how she will take the test when she feels like she is at home. �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� Saeng said to herself. Those things make her feel welcome and feeling that way will help her with her test. The paragraph concludes the story with all the things she is comfertable with. This conclusion helps the reader understand what reminds her of home. Also explains how much the hibiscus flower ment to her. Buying the flower helps her with her troubles. Seeing the geese fly reminds her of her home. The author concludes the story with the memories that will help Saeng in the future.	2	2		2																					
2255	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it resembles to her own life, that she will have another chance, just as geese will come back again. The reason why the last part resembles back to her life is that it says in the spring, spring is usually a good time of year because it gets warmer towards @DATE2 and Flowers come back. The hibiscus plant will bloom again and that will renew, In a way, her warming thought of her old home. Then that will be the time to retake her driving test that she failed, which was before she bought the plant. The author added this last part because it tied and matched so well with the story.	2	2		2																					
2260	4	I think that the author concludes the story like that because @MONTH1 be she�s saying that by that time she�ll be ready to take the test again. Another way of thinking is that @MONTH1 be by that time when that happens in spring she would be preprared and more confident of herself. @MONTH1 be the author was trying to say that just like the begining of a new springs, it would be a new beginning for her.	2	1		2																					
2269	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. One reason I think is because she�s concluding that the winter is there, and when winter is over, she is going to start flowering and planting again. In the story it said, �the winter hibiscus was in the ground now,�.� So, now she has to wait for winter to pass by then the hibiscus will be starting to grow and will hopefully be alone by spring. So, that is why I think she concluded the story the way she did.	0	0		0																					
2272	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the story ends with saying �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� The reason the author ends the story like that is because it showing that eves though she @MONTH1 of failed the test once shes not going to give up just because of as adjustment change. The Hibiscus made the reader relize that a plantation where she lives can adapt so can she. 	1	1		1																					
2273	4	The reason she ended the story like that is because when everything is blooming she will feel more at home and will have healthy. I say this because the girl used to help her grandma withe her hair before she moved. So if the flower is blooming then it would remind her of her grandma which would be insentive to do good on the test.	1	1		1																					
2284	4	The author concluded the story with that paragraph because, he wanted to show that she wasn�t going to give up just because she failed one time. She failed the test one time already. She was very sad about it. She went and bought a plant. Saeng�s mom told her that they were going to do it the right way. Saeng was crying when she told her mom about it. Her mom was very understanding thought. Her  mom could have been very mad with her. She could of used a plant that they grew. The plant @MONTH1 not grow right now. She should of bought a real plant from someone else.	1	1		1																					
2291	4	"I beleive the author ends the story with this paragraph because it refers to previous events in the story. For example it says, ""and this hibiscis is budding"". This refers back to the beginning of the story when Saeng first saw the hibiscus plant and it reminded her of home. This is a good way to conclude a story. I wouldn�t change it at all if I could. Also in the summary before the story it says how she had failed her driver�s test and in the last paragraph it says, ""then I will take that test again,� I think Saeng didn�t have much confidence before taking the test because of her new surroundings but is now that she is familiar with everything and found a hobby she will think of passing while taking the test again. I think she is looking to start over and forget about failing.  "	2	2		2																					
2294	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to make the reader want more. When an author ends the chapter of a story or an episode of a show it is always a good idea to use a cliffhanger to drag the audience along. In many stories have read this is used. In my @CAPS1, the @PERSON1 book it always ends with a cliff-hanger. Like in the end of the third book one of the soldiers is killed but you don�t find out by who until the next book.	1	1		1																					
2303	4	The author of the Winter Hibiscus concludes the story with the paragraph to show the connection between the hibiscus and @CAPS1. The hibiscus has to survive the winter until spring were it can bloom and became big and beautiful. @CAPS1 is connecting to the flower and saying she can make it through her obstacles that come with the change in enviroment if the flower can deal with being confined in a plastic container and surviving the weather. She feels that right now she's likes the Hibiscus. She�s trapped because the area is alien to her and she has to adjust. Just as the container is alien to the flower because it�s used to being free. But once it�s planted, it will become a part of it's surroundings and grow. And once she accepts the change and becomes willing to start over, she will begin to grow and that will cause her driving test to be easier. In conclusion, this is the reason the author concluded the paragraph with this sentence.	3	3		3																					
2309	4	They had to come back so they did and they were walking into an then world over there in the corner and the childhood world to just as she had known it would feel.	0	0		0																					
2310	4	This last paragraph is written for several reasons. First, she will try again when she feels the time is right. Just like the geese coming back, Saeng will comebak to take the test, and so the Hibiscus plant will also bloom again. She feels that it is the right thing to do and it will be the right time to come back and take the test. This pharagraph describes Saeng well about how she lives and how she will take the test again when she feelsit is right.	2	1		2																					
2311	4	"I believe that the author ends because the author is showing that Saeng is determined to pass the test. ""She paused as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter's cheeks and her puffy eyes. ""(Ho) This quote shows that passing the test meant a lot to Saeng. She was crying because she couldn't help but buy the plant and fail the test. She didn't want to fail and showed her sadness by crying.� then I will take the test again.� (Ho) This quote shows that even though she failed, she is determined to pass the test and succeed. Failing hurt her greatly. so she can't wait to do it again and pass because she is determing to succeed. This is all important because Saeng shows that determination is the key to success and she is determined."	1	2		2																					
2313	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she was upset that she moved. She is also upset that she failed her drivers test. So she planted the plant and shes says that when spring comes, she will retry her drivers test	1	1		1																					
2315	4	The author concludes with this sentence for emphasis. It takes Saeng�s mind off of the flower and she focuses on her test. By waiting until next spring to take the test it gives her something to look forward to. This statement also shows that you should never give up on anything that you do. The author ends on a good note explaining this, The last paragraph is also a break from the rest of the story and from what Saeng�s was just doing. It is Saeng�s last and final thoughts.	2	2		2																					
2318	4	The authors conclusion in the story explains that after all that team work and handwork you should keep that flow going each year even though something might have changed.	0	0		0																					
2320	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show determination. It shows that saeng wants to take her time to adjust to her new life and her  new surroundings. Then she thinks it might feel more like this place is becoming a home. She feels that maybe, if shes been used to this new place for awhile she will have a better chance at passing the test. she is determined to pass the test.	2	1		2																					
2321	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because when Saeng was saying this to herself, she made a promise to not give up getting her license and the hibiscus makes her feel like she is at home again. In the text when the mother says, ""@CAPS1 seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers arent as pretty, but its strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. Thats what matters.� when she says this it makes Saeng not sad because she knows that the hibiscus will remind her of the hibiscus at home and that gives her the power to want to try again in the spring."	2	2		2																					
2322	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think that the author includes this paragraph to show how persistant Saeng is. Saeng is persistant because she trys over and over again at this �test� and also she trys to get used to her new country. It demonstrates this in the story when it says the quote above. This quote shows that Saeng can try something and fail, then be determined to try and succeed again. Also in the story, Saeng has moved from one country to another. This is a huge jump and for her to be confident with herself is very persistant. The way the author concludes the story, with �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� definitely portrays Saeng, the main character as a persistant person, and that is the purpose of the quote.	2	2		2																					
2324	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph for many reasons. The author wanted to convey a sense of hope to show the growth of her character, and to show how thing are  going to change. In the last paragraph when she vows that she will take that test again it gives you a sense that everything will be okay. Earlier in the story she had been crying and missing her homeland the tone was troubled and sad. This last paragraph suggests that the tone is now hopeful. Even though she failed the test she is still going to try again. The author also put the paragraph to show how much her character has grow. Saying that she will try again shows how much stronger determed she is lastly, she had the story end with that paragraph to foreshadow what is to come.The geese coming back and the snow melting, and the hibiscus budding all show a change in the seasons. This represents the change that has occurred in her and it foreshadows that things will be different from now on.	3	3		3																					
2328	4	"Authors sometimes use intisting sentences as there concludy sentence that you @MONTH1 have a hard time understding. In the story �Winter Hibiscus� The author concludes her story by saying �when they come back. Saeng vowed siletly to herself, iN the sprng, when the snows melt and the gesse return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The author says this to show that Saeng is not ready to gardam yet and needs to lean more. The mother is verry disapointed in the daghter for buying a plant that is very expensve and shows her inexperience in that buying thigs because of your fodings is wrong. This is showed wha they say �I paid over Nineteen dollars for it."" � You what?� She also, says � @CAPS1 facing. Na where did you gott that"" showing her suprise of the expensve beutiful plant. Authes use those paragraphs and sentences to show or recap the story. The Author of �winter hibiscus� @CAPS2 her story with the paragraph because Saeng shuld Not hav boght the plant bascal a hav emotions and that she shall try agan Next year to not mess up."	1	1		1																					
2339	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he/she is trying to put across the message that the plant shows a symbol of new beginings which is a symbol of saeng�s vowe. Also in the story caring for the plant teaches saeng responsablity in obtaining her license by care for the plant it will teach her patients and that she needs to learn from mistakes made.	1	1		1																					
2342	4	I think that the concluding paragraph means after everything   else   important and what is meant to happen happens then she will take the test because its  basically the last  thing has to happen and I think she will pass it because it meant to happen.	1	1		1																					
2344	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus� concludes the story with  the excerpt ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� because it emphasizes Saeng pain to come to an unknown place and fail her first test but also emphasizes Saeng�s resolve to work hard after seeing a flower that resembled one from home. The flower itself is very important to Saeng, for example, the text reads �And besides it was yet another old friend. a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers.� This excerpt demonstrates Saeng�s love for her hometown through a flower that she knows grows back home. Another example is when Saeng told her mother the bad news �I-I failed the test� @CAPS1 attention instantly was drawn to the flower and her mother could only be good. In conclusion, the hibiscus flower is Saeng�s source of stength as it�s the only thing she knows in the united states. Saeng wants to show the same resolve on her test that the  flower shows in the harsh winter."	2	2		2																					
2346	4	By this quote, the author is explaining that Saeng will eventually be ready for her test. When the geese return, they're ready to return From their migration and when the hibiscus is budding, it is ready to turn into a beautiful flower. Saeng believes that in the spring, since the flower and the geese are ready, she too will be ready.	2	1		2																					
2349	4	In the passage �winter hibiscus� the author uses this phrase in the last paragraph �when they came back, Saeng vowes silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again. I believe she concluded this story with these words she change because she is saying to you in that means when the birds flewaway. Even the bird seasons would be back like always. An example of this is when she says the birds eased into the hibiscus. Mingled because the last paragraph thinking that she would stay again next season and keys very what she likes to do. This what I get out as the last paragraph are the story �winter hibiscus� as what it means to me.	2	1		2																					
2352	4	The author concluded this paragraph in the story because it was showing that there are geese that hang around the garden around the spring time.	0	0		0																					
2353	4	The author in this story explaynes how hard some changes can be. The author also explayns how family and object frome home such as the flower can be comforting. The meaning of the story is to show one of the author expierances in life.	1	1		1																					
2354	4	I think the author concludes this party because he wanted to let the reader know that it wasn�t it for the little girl and she wasn�t going to give up on planting flower and that when the spring come and the snow had melt she was going to plant some more flower and see how they will do during the spring even though that it didn�t work as well as the winter season she did let her stop her I think the author is trying to say is that if you do something and it doesn�t work keep on trying maybe something different will happen.	0	0		0																					
2361	4	I think the author concludes that paragraphs to show more meaning of the story.The author could of wanted to show more details in the story.	0	0		0																					
2363	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� is the paragraph that the author uses to conclude the story. In the my opinion the author includes this paragraph to conclude the story in order to show Saeng is committed to adjusting  to her new home and to leaving her old one. For example, in the story Saeng was unable to say �I mean, not like the kind we had at home.� without bursting into tears. This illustrates her sorrow and inability to let go of her past.	1	2		2																					
2372	4	This is a very important paragraph for the narrator to put in the story. For instance, Saeng is saying that her new home with her flowers is more important than school and a test. And, saeng doesn�t have many friends go see at school but her hibiscus will remind her of all of her old friends she made. Saeng is simply stating to herself that once everything is back to normal or the way she wants to she it then she can take that test again. In conclusion, the narrator used this paragraph to let us know how saeng feels.	1	1		1																					
2376	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. �Where Saeng vowed silently to herself,� in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscun is budding, then I will take that test again. Minpong Ho did so because she failed the test. Saeng failed to fine the fine�toothed comb, the hibiscus hedge, the well, and her gentle grandmother. Apperantly this things could be found after the snows melt and the geese reture and hibiscus is budding.	1	1		1																					
2378	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because in the story it says ""I will take that test again."" So she's trying to say she will she how much she have adjusted to changes in life. In the story it also states ""when they come back"" That concludes that when the flower's come back next season. She will she how much she reminber about her homeland, her grandma and the good things."	1	1		1																					
2379	4	The reason  why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because they wanted the reader to know there will be another story that will be made up. Also to show that Saeng was not happy that the snow melted and the geese return and the hibiscus was budding.	1	1		1																					
2381	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows that Saeng can over come her weaknesses and succeed in her newhome. What the @CAPS1 �In the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� It means she�ll try the @CAPS2 Test again try new test to make her like wheres she�s at and what she can @CAPS3 from it.	1	1		1																					
2383	4	Minfong Ho concluded the story with this because it shows Saeng�s determination to pass the drivers test. The fact that she failed it made her feel bad, and brought out feelings of homesickness as did the familiar plant, but in this final paragraph she vows that she will overcome all her challenges of being in an unfimiliar place and pull herself together to accomplish her goal as did the winter hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
2384	4	The author included this sentence in the paragraph because Saeng was a very determined girl. She would keep trying till she got it right. No matter how long or hard it would be she would get it done. Just like from the picture of the Hibiscus flower next to the highway. It certainly woked out of place, but it would do anything to survive. Being strong at times when you can only depend on yourself is hard to do, but Saeng is determined from her loss and the perfection of the Hibiscus flower.	2	2		2																					
2385	4	In the concluding statement Saeng states that �when they come back In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The author concludes the story with this passage because she is using the hibiscus as an example of survival. The hibiscus isfrom another place like her, and she is using it to represent her well being in the new place. In a way she is saying , If the hibiscus survives this winter, than so will I. I believe she uses this as a conclusion to depict her unsure nature towards her new home.	2	3		3																					
2387	4	The author concludes the story with this specific paragraph to sum up the realization and determination Saeng obtains. First of all, Saeng starts out upset after failing her test. When she sees the flower and goes to find it at a shop she is overwhelmed by this small reminder of her old home. That small flower made her realize how much she missed her old home and buying it becomes a nessesity for her. She probably felt that with that flower she would always have a little piece of home in this newer world. After realizing that memories are whats  important and seeing that flower�s determination to survive a cold winter, she develops the determination to take the test again. She vows to do so because she has gained faith from the flower�s survival and her realization of important memories. All in all ,that ending paragraph reveals these specific messages	3	3		3																					
2389	4	Memory,promise,life-all are ideas that explain why the author concludes the  story with this paragraph.Memories is one  idea that helps explain why the author concludes this story  with  this paragraph because saeng misses her old life and country.Promise is another idea because saeng makes a vow that once spring comes again she will take the test again.Life is another idea because saeng brought the flower and planted soit can live once spring has come and she said  the n she will  retake the test. Memories, promise, and life help explain why the author conclude the story with this paragraph. Memories will come back in the spring along with the promises she has made and the that wants to start and saeng is doing this by pla nting the hibiscus which brings back a lot of her memories from her life	2	2		2																					
2390	4	The author concludes the story with that statement because it had gotten colder and all the plants and flowers were going to die.	0	0		0																					
2392	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus�, Saeng had failed her drivers test and as she is walking home she spies a flower that reminds her of what once her home. She buys the flower and returns to her new home to her mother who is working in the garden. They decide to plant the flower in the garden, and when the flower was planted, a flock of geese fly over head, Saeng then realizes that everything is familier to her now, when everything was quite strange to her. She concludes the story saying when the geese come back in the spring, she will take the test again. She says that the flower will be buckling which means blooming or growing, and she will have been grown and familiar to everything then, so she will be ready for the test when the geese as ready to come home and the hibiscus is ready to bloom	2	2		2																					
2393	4	The author does this because they are comparing to the plant. The author does this because when the plant starts to bloom then the character�s confidence will come back. The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it gives the story some meaning.	1	1		1																					
2394	4	The Author concludes this story With the @CAPS1 paragraph to emphasize the story and make it seem more interesting as to make the reader want the story to keep going on to find out what happens next.	1	1		1																					
2400	4	Saeng and her mother have to be determined to try their best in order to survive. Saeng and her mother has been thourgh a lot and when she failed the @CAPS1 test, she was more depressed than before, The author concludes this story with this paragraph to give readers the thought oF how it is to be determined to adapt and survive in a different place and though Saeng and her mother are away from their homeland they still enjoy the things they did in Vietnam, like the flowers, and the hot peppers and bitter melons, her friends disagree with the taste but it doesnt stop her from enjoying what she loves most.	2	2		2																					
2408	4	the author conclude this story like that to show a new beginning in the spring. Like how flowers bloom and bud in spring she will become a new better person. that why the author conclude the story like this.	1	1		1																					
2412	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that Saeng is Finally comfortable with her new �home.� After the passage is mostly a reflection of Saeng�s old life, it ends this way to signify that she has become accustomed to her new way of life. For example, it says �in the spring, and the geese return�� that shows that she is now used to the geese and the nature of her new world. The author also uses that paragraph at the end to show a sense of release. Saeng had so many memories locked inside her old life, that she couldn�t grasp new ones in her new home. The authors use of this paragraph is a good way to close out the story because it lets the reader feel the relaxed scene of the birds flying away; Saeng escaping  her pain and becoming  a real part of her new world.  	2	3		3																					
2421	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has meaning. The author is saying that when these animals and living creatures get their chance she too, will get hers. For example, the geese will get to return, the hibiscus will get it's chance to bud and she will get her chance to take her drivers test. I know this because Saeng�s mother starts talking about how great the plant will be in the spring. She even says, �But its strong enough to make it through the cold months�. This indicates that the mom is trying to tell her that she will get a second chance. That is why the story ends with that sentence.	2	2		2																					
2428	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph bY the author shows that Saeng is not giving up and that she found a hobby to look forward too An example �the winter hibiscus was in the ground now and Saeng tamped down the soil around it overhead at lock of Canada geese flew by�, That why the author cludes the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2433	4	"In my opinion, the author concludes the story by saying that she will retake the drivers test because not only will she take the drivers test again, but she will also be more comfortable in her life. The drivers test is not the main problem, it�s adapting to her new environment that is causing Saeng so much heartache. For example,  in lines @NUM1 Saeng�s thought�s are ""A wave of loss so deep and strong stang Saeng�s eyes now and swept over her �and� in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng brake down and wept.� This piches that Saeng is having trouble readjusting to her new life and is reminded of her old memories from where she used to live and cries because it�s gone. I think that failing her drivers test was just little thing that finally caused her to cry because of the stress, and when she said  �and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.� It means that she will overcome all that and move on."	3	3		3																					
2434	4	It was good that the author concluded the story with this paragraph. Saeng loved the hibiscus so when spring come and the hibiscus would bloom it would  be the best time to take that test again from already failing it. It would probably make her more confident to take the driving test again at the right time. So in conclusion that�s why the author concludes that paragraph in the story	1	1		1																					
2438	4	"The story �Winter Hibiscus� is written by Minfong Ho. The author ended the story with this excerpt, �When they come back, �Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The reason for this is so she will have time to adjust. Saeng just needs a little comforting because all of this is new to her. This words use figurative language because the geese reminded her of herself, �Almost familiar to her now. Like geese.""  "	2	1		2																					
2443	4	The author concluded the story with this sentence because shes letting people know that she enjoys nature more than school.	0	0		0																					
2445	4	The author concludes this story with this paragraph because she is telling us what will happen beyond the story we are reading. It means when the snow melts, she�ll start all over again and rebuild the greenhouse.	0	0		0																					
2450	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because of some causes. Saeng vowed silently to herself. That shows she calm down already, she feels better with her new country. She feels the snows meet, the geese return, she says that she will take that test again. It shows one that she doesn�t feel bad with the test more. She knows that she has opportunity to take it again and does it better. She has a different feeling with her problem. She looks her new country with a different eyes. All things with her become better. These are some reasons explain why the author concludes this story with this paragraph.	2	1		2																					
2473	4	The Hibiscus is budding means that the flower was growing. That is a flower with lots of bright colors and nothing else can beat it. The reason another flower can�t beat it is because that flower represents so much thing and it is one of the most natural born flowers around.	1	1		1																					
2475	4	"People have to adapt to different cultures if they move. They could do this in a variety of ways, including making new friends and adjusting to the area. However, when adjusting to a new area, you should still remember your past home as well. This is what Minfong Ho is trying to display in the ending paragraph of the story, ""Winter Hibiscus�. In the story, a teenage girl named Saeng moved from Vietnam to the @LOCATION2 She has various rememberances of her past home while visiting a plant store. She buys a plant that was common in Vietnam and plants it in her garden. The last paragraph of the story says �In the spring, when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that driving test again�. This shows Saeng�s desire to fit in with this culture, by taking the driving test, as well as remember her past, by keeping the flower. This last paragraph summarizes Saeng�s emotion for her old country as well as her determination to succeed here."	2	2		2																					
2481	4	The auther concludes the story with this statement because it shows that to her the hibiscus symbolizes overcoming obstacles. It symbolizes this because she says�...and the geese return and this is budding, I will take that test again� (Ho @NUM1). This shows that even though she failed it this time when the hibiscus gets bigger she will retake the test, it shows ??? or overcoming obstacles. Also I believe that this symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it �gives her strength from her old country�. This shows that it symbolizes overcoming obstacles because it will help her overcome this test. It will do this by giving her strength or comforting her. From this you can tell that the author ends the story with this statement. ???...	2	2		2																					
2482	4	I believe that the author concludes  the story with this paragraph because it says that Saeng is confident and is willing to go back and take the test. Saeng feels good about her self and wants to do this.	1	1		1																					
2487	4	"I feel that the author concludes the story with this phrase as a way of showing how Saeng is adopting to her new home, yet still valueing her old one. The gist of the sentence is that Saeng will take her test again in the spring, showing her perseverance. However, the sentence also shows how Saeng is coming to know her new land. She says,�when the snows melt and the geese return� this is important because the geese and the snow are of her now home, and she now accepts them. However, Saeng also says, �when this hibiscus is budding,""  and this shows how Saeng is still thinking of her old home, because the plant is her connection to the memories of Vietnam.  Therefore, I feel that the author is showing how Saeng is growing up and living with changes in her life by ending the story with this statement.   "	3	2		3																					
2489	4	I think the author includes this because she doesn�t want to leave her audience guessing about what would happen next. Then �I will take the test again.� This quote is saying she @MONTH1 have failed the test with the plant but she is never going to give up and that when spring comes she is going to try again. I feel as though the author added this to give a better understanding of how it feels to leave your homeland to come to a place you don�t no or understand such as the flower situation in the story. When she thought about the plants and how they smelt it gave her the old feelings that she had about her homeland and how close she was with her grandmother. She was so use to plants being free and growing rather than seeing them in pots and not having the room to grow. By seeing all this got Saeng to break down and cry. In conclusion I feel as though the author added the paragraph in the end for understanding and to all so let you no that Saeng @MONTH1 be in a new place with a new culture but she will never give up on that test until she feels that she has passed it.	2	2		2																					
2491	4	The reason I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph was because it was a good learning story you can learn something from it .The author did that so you can get a better understanding of the of the story. It said �saeng .teenage  girl, and her family have moved to the united states of Vietnam.� So from reading that it tells me that its telling you what happen right before the story took place. So you can get a better understanding. To me its rapping it all up for you. Thats why I think the author concludes the story with the paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2496	4	Why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because I think it�s showing how much it actually means to her and shows that she does actually care And by showing that she care's will take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2501	4	The author concludes the story like that to give the reader the idea that you cant just quit if you fail. When Saeng said that when spring comes around I will return and take the test again, that shows that she will not quit and life will go on. That�s why I think the author chose to conclude the story like that.	1	1		1																					
2510	4	The author ended the story with the paragraph in order to show that Saeng is looking forward into her life and with a positive outlook. It shows that she is not going to be depressed by the change in her life anymore. The hibiscus is used as a device for this story�s plot. When changes happen with the hibiscus, changes happen in the story. At first, Saeng is without the hibiscus and feels hopeless. When she sees it, she remembers her past and is sad. Once she plans it, things start to look up. She begins to accept the change when the last paragraph says, �when they come back... and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� it shows that Saeng is looking at her future positively, and with this positive change, the hibiscus is now beginning to bloom. The author concludes the story in a symbolic way that helps express the story�s themes.	3	2		3																					
2511	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph �Saeng vowed silently to herself� because she Saeng wants to do in proper time and season. �winter season�, the land or soil was so cold that plants was not able to grow properly. �Hibiscus costs nineteen dollars�, and she Saeng failed the test. �There was frail, wiry beauty to her Saeng mother that touched Saeng deeply�, she Saeng mother is shining when she worked to plants. These all are the description that concludes in the past which want to make correction and shine like her mother and also to pass the test.  	1	1		1																					
2516	4	When spring comes and all the snow melts then she is going to plant newseeds. The author concludes that because she didn�t do good on the test the first time. But next year she is going to work with her plants then take the test again so she can pass it. The author put that in the conclusion because he don�t want people to think that she just worries about the plants.	1	1		1																					
2519	4	This paragraph means when winter is over and the geese come back from the south, and she favorite plant comes back that used to be in her old country, she will try what she was trying to do before but this time she has more confidence. This is what I think this means.	1	1		1																					
2520	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it sums everything up and solves the conflict of her failing her driver's test. When Saeng said ""� I will take that test again"" it showed that she is determined to pass the tes and will try again. Since the conflict is solved there you pretty much have to introduce a new conflict to keep the story going so the author just ends it. This excerpt from the last paragraph also incorporates Saeng difficultly to that geese because just as geese faces hardships getting her driver lisense. But also like the geese she will go back her face hardships again. "	1	2		2																					
2529	4	The author concludes the response by saying that when spring comes and the hibiscus is budding she will take the test again. because I think she feels hope and faith. I say this because the girl just moved away from her home and feels horribly lonesome and deppresed   because she wants to go home. She I nostalgic for her past and when she sees the plant it gives her a sense of comfort like she is home. When she says �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� I think she says this because she is upset because she failed her test and the plant gives her a sense of comfort which gives her faith and hope that she will pass the test in spring.	2	2		2																					
2540	4	Saeng was talking about testing the plants seeing if the geese liked where she planted them. I know this because she mensioned geese in the last paragraph and in the geese said �yes| when she planted the hibiscus.	0	0		0																					
2542	4	I think the author concludes the story with that paragraph because at the end is talking of a new begining. Also what it�s going to be at the new begining she says that she is going to take the test again.	1	1		1																					
2546	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the plant wasent budding and the geese are going away and then see failed the test because all that made her sad. But when the snow melts, the geese return and the plant starts budding she will be happy again and she will take the test agian and she will pass because she is happy.	1	1		1																					
2555	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it says when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take the test again which means that when she gets older and gets more confidence then she will blossom and get to take the test when she is ready just like the hibiscus will be ready to start to budding again.	1	1		1																					
2570	4	I think that the author uses this quote, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is buding, then I will take the test  again.� @CAPS1 it symbolizes that spring brings new life and hope. �But where was the home thought come? The hibiscus hedge? The way her gentle grandmother?� �BOAT RIDE into the night and it was gone.� @CAPS2 from Vietnam to @LOCATION2. one night she had so much hope, like, abundance, then the next she is in foreign land that is nothing like her old home. The flowers bloom in the spring bringing new life. There is a chance to move on @CAPS1 there is hope. There is hope that spring will come, flowers will come birds will come. It is a chance to let go. The ending quote was said to bring hope and like to her and she sort of promises to herself that it will get better. Hope is what makes every obstacle to get over easier and everything to be bearable. 	3	3		3																					
2572	4	The author concludes the story this way to show Saeng does not give up and is determined to pass the test. The narration says �Not like the kind we had @NUM1]. Saeng feels very strongly about her old home and wants hibiscus just like her and her grandmother used to have. Because Saeng would not bring back the same kind of hibiscus, she is sad and determined to get another one. The text also states, �� and the hibiscus is budding then I will take the test @NUM2]. This also shows she is determined because even though she failed the test once she is going it to try again. She misses her home and wants hibiscus just like she had at her old home. 	2	2		2																					
2576	4	The author concludes the story, �Winter Hibiscus�, with the strong paragraph of one sentence starting that Saeng will take the test when the geese return and the hibiscus is budding. This sentence leaves the reader in suspense while incorporating the main point of the story and combining them to express an idea about what might happen in a continuation on the future of @CAPS1 and this story. After all, the reason Saeng had bought the hibiscus was to comfort her mother and her-self. While she stood watching the geese, the author chose this moment to express Saeng�s feelings to stay determined and take the test. In the end, the author concluded the story with a string sentence which not only summerized the story, but left a cliff hangs.	3	2		3																					
2577	4	�When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself ,in the spring ,when snows melt and geese return and  this hibiscus is budding ,then I will take the test again� . The author concludes the story with this paragraph because this makes you think about the story after your done reading it.	0	0		0																					
2588	4	The author concludes this story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with that paragraph as a sign of reasurrance. Saeng had had a tough few years adapting to the United States from Vietnam, this paragraph leaves the reader with hope that she will overcome this challenge just like a bump in the road. Saeng had just had a rough day after just failing her driver�s test and wanted to buy the plant she saw on her walk home. While in the greenhouse she says, �That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother?� Saeng missed all these things from Vietnam, especially during this rough time. The final paragraph gives hope that she will take the test again and it will all be okay. The winter is a symbol of the hardships she has and will continue to go through. It says,��in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The winter is a hardship for the geese in that they must move away, the hibiscus must survive the cold winter, and the winter is time Saeng will be away from Vietnam. As the geese and the hibiscus overcome it, so will she. This last paragraph is a good, positive and hopeful ending to this touching story, so the reader knows to have hope in life.   	3	3		3																					
2589	4	There is why the author ended the story with this paragraph. It mean that when she comes back after winter she will repeat her tasks all over. For example she will dig, sen flowers, their customers. Then when winter comes again she will do it all over. So has steally the other is using different words to say when winter ends she will repeat her actions. That is why the author ended the story with that paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2606	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph (when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again) because it explains what she is going to do when winter is over. Also to keep the readers guessing on what�s going to happen, to Saeng and her mother. Another reason is to have a new story when winter is over.	1	1		1																					
2611	4	In the story the test was if she could overcome her homesickness. When she want to the greenhouse all of the. plants and flower brought back memories of her homeland. When she saw the flower it reminded her of the times life she would get water from the well and and a flower was floating in it. So after the winter she would go back to the place and see if she was still homesick. I feel she ended it that way because it shows that she will persevere and not give up and try again  	3	3		3																					
2618	4	The author concludes the story of the end because I think the author concludes the end of the story because he wants to kind of say I will be ready next year to sprout again he will be ready to test him to not cry and break down when he sees the plant to think of childhood memories he will be ready o	1	1		1																					
2620	4	The author concluded this paragraph in this story because I think that he is tring to tell the reader a message. The author is tring to say that if a plant can mak it through the cold winter then she can pass her driver�s test. That is why I think the author included that paragraph. 	2	2		2																					
2624	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because the season is over. For example it is starting in the winter the hibiscuses are dying. Also she is leaving and wont come back till she can plant flowers again in the spring, and she will come back again when she takes the test over again. In conclusion that is why the author ends the story with this paragraph.	0	0		0																					
2625	4	The reason the author of �Winter hibiscus� ends the story with the last paragraph is to give hope to the end. It gives a certain lift of joy at the end  of a moderatly depressing story. It just goes to show that if you care enough you can keep moving foreward.  And that the end of your world comes when you make it so. That is why I think the author used such a powerful statement at the end.	2	1		2																					
2626	4	The character has what seems to be a new found confidence and a new joy of the plant that reminds her of her home land comforting her and motovating her. She says when those things come back she will try hard to complete the test. She is setting a time to push herself.  As most people try to do	1	1		1																					
2629	4	In the story winter Hibiscus Saeng is fond of Beautiful flowers that once grew in her home land. Her favirte flower was the winter Hibiscus that had beautiful red pedals on it as of velvet. She also failed a test that she had taken so what the story is trying to say is that nothing can be as good as whats at home but sometimes you just need another chance at something.	1	1		1																					
2630	4	I think he did because he wanted to show how he loved everything in life.	0	0		0																					
2631	4	The reason why the author of the story ended the story like that is because after all the hard time that plant went through, it will still bad at the end of the winter. The author said that the plant will take that test again that test is surviving through the could winter and blunming at the end of the winter	1	1		1																					
2636	4	Because to her it is the best time to do things cause all the happy memories return along with the geese and hibiscus.	1	1		1																					
2641	4	"The author of �Winter Hibiscus� ends the story with the paragraph �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"" for a couple of reasons. Most of all because the hibiscus blooming represents hope - the plant will survive through the winter months and will grow again and become strong. So, too, will Saeng. Although Saeng is in a strange place where she doesn�t want to be, she is able to overcome adversity and hardship. In the same way, the hibiscus can withstand the winter. This is why the author ends the story the way she does, to give the impression that Saeng still has hope."	2	2		2																					
2644	4	The author concludes the story with this last paragraph because it shows by spring she will be ready to retake her test. It shows that like the geese who care and come back, she will have time to study and pass her test. In the story the author includes this last paragraph to truly show her dedication to eventually grow to be comfortable in her new home and to pass her drivers test all in good time. Saeng wants to be comfortable with her new life but isn�t yet because of what one misses. But she knows that after this she can go back and try again just like the geese do often our winter. This was a very effective way to end the story because it really communicated Saeng�s message of dedication and longing to overcome her obstacles, her new home and driving.  	2	3		3																					
2645	4	I think the author concludes like this because its almost like a new beginning. The ending of the story makes you think that Saeng is going to get on with her life. It makes me think that @CAPS1 plans to start her life over in comparison with the hibiscus. Once the plant �starts over� (rebuds) she will start over once again. It also shows that she is determined to continue on with her life in @LOCATION1. She will not let her life be distraught by her move Vietnam. She hopes that she will be able to start her life over again. The ending is a �cliff hanger� to show that her story has not yet completely ended. It shows that there is still possibility that she can get on with her life. It also shows she doesn�t let her failures control her. She is a strong young woman and is determined to overcome this. 	2	2		2																					
2646	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because its a very good ending paragraph that grabs your attention a little bit. Also it shows that the girl is determined to pass her test, so that makes you think this is a determind story. This is why the author concluded the story with this paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2648	4	The author coNcludes the story with this paragraph because she was tryiNg to say siNce the hibiscus is plaNted we are goiNg to see how it does with the winter. ANd wheN spriNg arrives and it's still staNdiNg she caN go take the test. I thiNk the author was compariNg the hibiscus to their life aNd obstacles they will go through, so if the hibiscus is still staNdiNg theN that meaNs everythiNg will be fiNe to where she caN go back aNd take the test.	1	2		2																					
2653	4	 The author decides to conclude the story with that because she wants the moral of the story to be burnt in your head. She believes that you will always have a chance to try again and the flower restarts its cycle and it gets another chance to bud and that symbolizes that you can start over and try again just like the girl is going to do on the test. She is doing the test again when the starts over so she can do. it with the flower and the flower budding will support her and give her hope.	2	2		2																					
2655	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author ends the story in a way that shows that she wants to start fresh. I think this because when she is talking to her mom at the end of the story, she says �In the spring, when this hibiscus is budding, I will take the test again�. She is saying that she wants to start over. and adapt to her new country. Also, I think this because she wants to wait until the seasons change to go take her test again. because she says �when the snow melts and the geese return.� She states this because she wants a completely new slate when she takes her test again. That is why I believe she wanted to conclude her story this way.	2	1		2																					
2659	4	The author of the story Winter Hibiscus ends the story with Saeng saying a vowe to herself because it shows how important the flower is to her. For example, the hibiscus flower gives her determination because it reminds her of home. Saeng says �� and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� The hibiscus flower gives her confidence. It reminds her of her home in Vietnam before they moved to @LOCATION2. Therefore, the author concludes the story with that certain paragraph because it symbolizes the importance of the flower.	2	1		2																					
2662	4	There are many reasons this paragraph is included. It shows the flower will emotionally encourage her when it is budding, because it will remind her of home. This is shown when she says �a blossom of two would have blown into the well� It reminds her of her homeland. It also is to show she is adapting to her new home. when the geese flew by she said�she realized that many things that she thought of as strange before had become, almost familiar to her now.� This shows how she is adapting and is now enjoying her new life. This final paragraph is important because it shows how her life is changing.	2	2		2																					
2666	4	The author ended the story this way because the plant represents new beginnings in which Saeng needs. Seang failed her test & needed some comfort. She went to the greenhouse & spent @MONEY1 on a hibiscus plant that reminded her of her home. It the same time the hibiscus plant reminded her that her new home is another new beginning. The hibiscus plant gives Saeng better hopes that starting over can be a good thing & that the next time she takes the test, she'll pass.	2	1		2																					
2667	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 reason why he does is because he wants to conclude by writing about geese. Second he like plants and the season�s that they bud. He vowed that he would take that test in the spring. He cant wait until the snow melts so that way he can take the test.	1	1		1																					
2672	4	"The author concludes the story �Winter Hibiscus� with this sentence when they come back saeng vowed silently to her self in spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The Winter Hibiscus symbolizes her fondness of the place she used to live before. Its not a real one I�m mean not the kind we had at-at� she was still too shaky to say the words at home� when the hibiscus buds� she will still be fond of her home but she will have adapted better to her current enviroment. The geese will have returned to their home means that she will find a place to call home in this place one day. When she finds that place she will find herself ready to �take the test"" or do things normally. The author concluded the story with the that sentence to show that Saeng will eventually grow into her new life."	3	2		3																					
2676	4	The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus� concludes her story this way to demonstrate the girls determination and to leave the reader anticipating more. I say this because obviously Saeng is determined to do well, but leaving the story hanging builds excitement for more action.	1	1		1																					
2677	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it shows that Saeng is getting used to living in a new place. Towards the end of the text, Saeng says that many things she thought were strange before had become familiar to her. The winter hibiscus was comforting, and reminded Saeng of her home. she says �In the spring when the snows melt� because she is beginning to get used to �the quiet repetition of season upon season�. The geese, which form a distinctive V are becoming familiar to her. The last paragraph is an effective way to end the story because it shows that saeng is becoming accostumed to her new surroundings and is hopeful the future.     	2	2		2																					
2684	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to show that she�ll hopefully be stronger. By that I mean she�ll feel comfortable in her new environment and she want miss her home as much. Also she tired the year but failed the best because she didn�t get her grandmother what she asked for and she spent it on something else. That is why I think the author added this paragraph to this story.  	1	1		1																					
2685	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph because it shows the main character, Saeng, adapting and trying her best with her new life style. For example, when she vowed to herself in the last paragraph saying, �in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. This implies that she is putting more effort in to what she do in her new environment and settings. In conclusion, the author concludes the story with that paragraph to show how someone is adapting to change.	2	2		2																					
2691	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph to set the sonip theme. In the story, the @CAPS1 represents very important thing to saeng � confidence, beauty, adaptation� some things she can apply to herself, & her memories of her old homeland. She had failed the driving test. Afterwards, she bought the @CAPS1 to comfort her homesickness. I saw the @CAPS1 as a sort of metaphor to Saeng the same @CAPS1, but growing differently in a different area just as she is still the same but in a new home. The significance of the last paragraph is mainly about the @CAPS1 budding. It represents to Saeng her homeland by the @CAPS1 blossoming ,it can represent her love for the homeland. When the author wrote �then I will take that test again� it is referring to the new confidence she @MONTH1 have later when the @CAPS1 blooms (another @CAPS1 /person metaphor)	3	3		3																					
2695	4	I think Saeng need to take the test over because to get her grade up. Saeng be waring about the snow, in the spirng because she is think about the flower getting cover over it. Saeng mother late her help with the pepper and melons, and lat her state dinner.	0	0		0																					
2700	4	The author describes last quote because he wants her dream to achieve. We describes �she realized that many of the things that she had thought the quiet repetition of season, almost familiar to her now. Saeng is from Vietnam, and her family have an @CAPS1 dream. so the author wants that her family adapt their new life in @LOCATION2.	1	1		1																					
2705	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph I think because since the girl failed her test the bud reminds her of her grandmothers long grey hair and I guess that gives her good luck so when the winter passes by and the spring time hits thats buds start to come back out and thats when she will take her test again. Thats why the author made this statement the last sentence of the story.	1	2		2																					
2717	4	The author concludes the story wt this passage because its symbolic. When the Geese come back in the spring it will be like a now beginning. When the Hibiscus is budding it has a new life. When all this happens Saeng will have a new fresh start too. Leaving the story to end like this is a cliff-hanger for some. It makes you wanting more, knowing she failed her test you want to know if Saeng will pass it in the spring, @CAPS1 a fresh new start. Everything and everyone will have new starts when the beginning of the new season comes around when the hibiscus blooms it will be like she has the new ability to overcome obstacles, new connections w/her past and comfort during hard times. The Hibiscus symbolizes all this	3	2		3																					
2723	4	The reason why the author used this paragraph is because he was sag that the snow go away in spring time that all.	0	0		0																					
2727	4	She concluded the paragraph with that paragraph to show that she is serious about her gardening and that she won�t garden until geese come back.	1	1		1																					
2734	4	"The author of the story, chooses to end the story with that sentence because the story is mainly about how Saeng failed her drivers test, but when she saw the hibiscus, it reminded her of home and made her feel better. In paragraph @NUM1, Saeng says, �And that rich, sweet scent � that was familiar too,"" talks about how nice the flowers were and how familiar they were because she reconized the scent. Saeng was already upset about leaving her home in @LOCATION1, then coming to @LOCATION2 and then failing her drivers test, just made it worse, but then she saw the flower and it reminded her of her home, so she felt a little better. So when the author uses that quote, they end the story that way to show that she will have enough courage to try again when the flower blooms."	2	3		3																					
2736	4	"In stories, author lend them many different ways with many different effects. In the story, Winter Hibiscus the author concludes the story with this paragraph because it has a �touching� affect to the reader and it basically sums up all the paints talked about in the story. The first example, is in the beginning of the conclusion, it says �Saeng vowed silently to herself�. In this unique quote, the author demonstrates imagery by giving you a mental picture of a silent lonly girl nealing down in the cold garden, whispering silently to herself. This quote and this part of the quote has a touching effect to the reader. Another example of why the author concludes the story with this is because it sums up all the parts covered in the story. ""When the geese return hibiscus is budding I will take that test again� This quote mentions the hibiscus which is mentioned a lot throughout, the geese in the end, and the failing of the test in the beginning. In conclusion, that�s why the author used that paragraph as the conclusion for such a touching story."	2	2		2																					
2741	4	The Author of �Winter Hibiscus� ends this story with that closing paragraph because it wraps up all the themes. It shows that Saeng has determination to overcome obstacles and it uses the plant as a metaphor, just like the rest of the story, the Hibiscus represents Saeng or adjusting to change. The plant �dies� in the winter and this is equivlent to @PERSON1 not getting her drivers licens, but the plant will come back, representing determination or adjustment, this is why Saeng says she will go back and pass the test because she has adjusted and is now determined to overcome this obstacle.	2	2		2																					
2743	4	He ends the story this way to show that she wants to and is willing to overcome leaving her homeland. In the story she goes to a green house. She is in the green house to test herself. She finds a plant from her homeland and and it reminds her of her grandmother. She finds other plants and they remind her of her homeland and she cries. I think she had a real connection with her grandmother. When they left their home country she probably cried for days its like she lost a part of her sole.	1	1		1																					
2746	4	The Author includes that part in his story because it�s talking about na ture and a the beuttifl thing's in natural. Ther�s the @CAPS1 @CAPS2's, tall green grass the white @CAPS3 fence and in the story there are those sanne type's of things that been in nature.	0	0		0																					
2750	4	I believe that she included this because she wanted to show important it was to her. For example when she says in the spring she will take the test again. I think that ment she will work harder to make sure she does everything right. So that she can say she follows through on things that are important to her. These are my thoughts on why she included this paragraph in the story.	1	1		1																					
2752	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is to let the readers know that how Saeng @CAPS1 about the hibiscus. I thinks the author concludes this because he his telling the reader that the hibiscus gives saeng goodluck and with this good luck She will past the test. In the story it tells us how much saeng adores the plant For example when she got to the hibiscus She reached out and toched a petal gently. It Felt smooth and cool. Thats why the author use thal paragraph at the end to indicate how Saeng @CAPS1 and how it make her  feel confident.	1	1		1																					
2754	4	By ending the story in the way the author has in the short story �winter Hibiscus,� the author provides a sympathetic understanding for the reader of seang at her struggle to live in another country & her sadness of wishing to be back home. I think the author was attempting to end the story with a strong feeling for a strong note of Saeng's personality to draw the reader back into what they had just read. For example, by repeating statement on the test saying � I will take that test again,� the author gives us that understanding that Saeng has not given up & lets the reader know she will stand & live strong.	2	2		2																					
2756	4	The author concludes the story here to show that Saeng would not give up. She simpley set a time for her to try again. Saeng wants to make it in this world and wants to have a good life, so she tries new things	1	1		1																					
2758	4	I think the author used this paragraph for the ending because it�s  meaning fail odvestily Saeng  really like garden and it�s  something  special to her . Also when all the snow  melts  she  will  take  the test  and  hopfully get her drivers  licesies.	1	1		1																					
2763	4	She said that she was going to take the test agen because to show her mom that she can do it and Past it this time. instad of worring over her old home.	1	1		1																					
2765	4	"In the last paragraphy the reason why the author uses ""when they come back, in the spring when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test. The author uses this because Saeng finally had found comfort. after  moving from a her homeland veelnam to the united States, she felt home sick. For example, she comes across this flower that reminds her of the time she spent in her homeland. She remember he grandmother's smell because of the plant. So when she finally got home to her mother, she showed the flower to her. They both planted the flower, and @CAPS1 got a sense of relief. Thats why she vowed that when winter was oven and spring came she would take that test, because she had a sense of home in her, that gave her uncouragement and strength. it also shows that even when your are in a different area and you are chew, there's always something that can male you remember the unemove and lime spent where you can from"	2	2		2																					
2770	4	It shows not to give up, it ends almost  the same way it began, it shows that people should not stay too attached to the past each are reasons why I believe the author concludes the story with that paragraph. It shows that people should not give up because even though she failed her test then she will try again later to pass it. Also the story ends the same way it begins by her taking the test or getting ready to which is a good way of writing. One last thing is that it shows that people shouldn�t become too attached to the past because if they look at one thing that reminds them of it they @MONTH1 fall apart, that is why she takes the test, to see if she can look at the familiar flowers without falling apart.   	2	2		2																					
2772	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� the author concludes the story with the lines �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The reason that the author concludes the test with these lines is because she is re-establing the symbolism of the plant. In the text it said that the plant budds in the spring, once it has time to grow and adapt to the new enviroment. Just as the plant needed that time so did the main character Saeng. She just moved from Vietnam and failed her drivers test. Saeng is very unsure of her new culture. For example she likes bitter melon it says. �But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself much prefered it to a Big Mac.� She appears to think she is misunderstood an no one likes her, but just as the plant will adapt to this new life so will she.	3	3		3																					
2773	4	"The auther conclude the story by saying she will take the test again in the spring and uptill then vow silently because the spring reminded Saeng of home. In Vietnam there were many beautiful wild flowers. Sarng goes to the flower shop to get a peice of home. It said the flower's ""leaves quivering in the wind.� This shows that the plant was not the same because there were also no buds. She had just failed her driving test before this and needed hope, so al waiting till spring when the hibiscus will bloom again that will give Saeng a sense of home which will give her hope to do good on the driving test. "	2	2		2																					
2774	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng whole world is the plants a since they are gone there is no motivation.	0	0		0																					
2781	4	The author concludes this story with hope in this sentence. The begining was very negative with Saeng failing her drive�s test and her mother yelling at her. But when this sentence comes the reader is filled with hope for the young girl Saeng. The author does this to show that Saeng will adjust and will peservere wheras before she was so upset, @CAPS1 when she said, �I-I failed the test.� Then for Saeng to refound from this event, gave the reader hope and thats why the author did this.	2	1		2																					
2783	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, saeng vowed don't really like to talk. Saeng liked to be by her self sometimes. When spring come it was a different story. Saeng loved the spring and @DATE2. She would play outside all day every day. Saeng was just a nice girl	0	0		0																					
2786	4	"In the story called ""Winter Hibiscus"" the author concludes the story with this paragraph ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, than I will take that test again."" The reason why the author had put that at the end of the story was because when things go under ground everyone wants to wait and wait until it comes back up again because when you fail everything goes down but if you wait awhile than everything will start to raise Just like flowers and everything else that you can think of. So that is why the author put that at the end of the story cause to tell people that it is ok for people to fail Just as long as you get up and try again until you reach your goal. So that is what the author was talking about and thats why Minfong Ho put that at the end of the story so that people can read and learn for what it says."	1	2		2																					
2789	4	"The author includes the paragraph, ""when they come back...then I will take that test again,"" to show that hibiscus is a symbol of time. Saeng uses the hibiscus to measure the amount of time there will be until she takes her test again.  The hibiscus also symbolizes the power to get through struggling (stay strong). Saeng had trouble with her test, but the hibiscus is there to help push her through it to prepare her for the next test. The hibiscus also helps Saeng's mother push through her hard time of seeing her daughter sad from not succeeding on the test. The plant helps the mother try and stay positive and it also helps the mother by trying to do the right thing for her daughter. In the story. the mother decides to plant the hibiscus in the garden to make her daughter happy. The hibiscus shows strong symbolism and it helps Saeng and her mother stay strong through out their struggles. "	3	2		3																					
2800	4	The importance as to why the author ended this story like this was to show readers the importance of the plant. It seems that because the author is not in her native country that she doesn�t have a lot around in this new place that can comfort her. The author being able to find a hibiscus in a place she thought she wouldn�t be able to gives her strength to do anything that she can. It is possible that whatever the challenge @MONTH1 be that the author is trying to get by the fact that she has some support from the plant gives her the achievement and confidence to complete her task	1	2		2																					
2803	4	The author concludes the story with, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� for several reasons. One reason the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the hibiscus flower will be adaptating to spring just like Saeng should to her new environment in the United States. Another reason is like the hibiscus budding, Saeng has began to grow older and much wiser of things allowing her to go back in the spring and hopefully pass the driving test. Lastly, in the text it says, �she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quit repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This shows Saeng is becoming familiar and at ease now of where she is living just how the hibiscus flower adapts to it's place with ease and gets use to seasons.	2	3		3																					
2815	4	The author most likely concludes the story that way because that is the time that Saeng feels most comfortable. Saeng and her mom moved from Vietnam, were the winter Hibiscus are popular and familiar to Saeng. She ends the text in this maner because it remins Saeng about Vietnam, and how she feels better during that time of year. When she says �And beside it was yet another old friend.� She feels as if this plant is a friend to her and it makes her feel more comfortable. This is why the author ended the story in the manner that she did.	1	2		2																					
2824	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, �When they com back, Saeng vowed silently to hersef, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, Then I will take that test again�. I believe the author concluded the story like this because it shows that the hibiscus represented to Saeng a new beginning and to restart what she had failed. When Saeng saw the hibiscus after failing her driving test, it gave her com fort in a time of disappointment, connection to her past experiences, and the abilities she could overcome her obstacles. Therefore, when the narrator says, �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again"", This implies a new beginning so the hibiscus is representing Saeng. This is why I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2827	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because she/he wanted to close the story with a conclusion that portrays the story. The author talked about the hibiscus in the story as a �comfort in time of distress� a hobby or thing she likes doing with her spear time. In conclusion the author concludes with that paragraph for the reasons stated in the @ORGANIZATION1	0	0		0																					
2828	4	The author ends the story with the given paragraph to get across. It highlights the things important and familiar to saeng that gave her comfort, and uses them to essentially say that she�ll take the test over again once she feels better. The winter hibiscus was a plant that saeng remembered of life back home up to the story, so when she sow the plant , �a wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung saeng �s eyes now swept over her.� Saeng was unable to comfort her emotions when she first saw the plant because she realized how much she missed her old life. The plant is mentioned in the final paragraph because when it blooms in the spring, the winter hibiscus will help fill the emotional void, and help saeng to try to take the test again. She also mentions the geese for the same reason, but in a different way. Unlike the winter hibiscus, it took a while for the geese to become, �through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� Saeng mentions this so that she can get used to the strange and unfamiliar parts of her life, and to come to grips with her failed test. Therefore by mentioning   the things she does in the last paragraph, saeng uses familiar objects, foreign and domestic, to illustrate her coming to grips with her failure.	3	3		3																					
2838	4	The author concludes the story with that paragrap for one main reason.	0	0		0																					
2839	4	The author is showing that Saeng wants to keep on with her mother's gardening. To take over an elders traditions and what her mother started.	0	0		0																					
2844	4	The author concludes the story with that particular paragraph for a number of reasons. The last paragraph states that �when they come back ... I will take the test again,� (Ho @NUM1). Already upset about failing her driving test, the main character is upset missing her homeland. The buds of the flowers give her hope and essentially, the strength to take the test over again. Also when she was originally in the flower shop, after smelling and seeing the flowers, �A  wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her ... And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept �(Ho @NUM2). It is obvious that to the main character these flowers mean so much to her; they take her back to her home country, which she was abruptly torn from and misses, they give her hope and they remind her of the things she loves, like her grandmother. In conclusion, the author chose to end the story with this paragraph because that is what means the most to the main character. 	2	2		2																					
2850	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because saeng  relatestnct  she needs more time. If she takes a break and does what she needs to then she @MONTH1 be able to pass the test.	1	1		1																					
2855	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. Because when the hibiscus started budding it will give her inspiration to try and past the test again. In order to past the test she wanted to feel like she was home, And to have memories of her home to incourage her to try again. Therefore, this is the reason the author concludes the story with the last paragraph.	1	1		1																					
2856	4	The author concludes the story with a paragraph taking the test again to show that the narrator @MONTH1 be upset about being in a new place but she will keep trying. The narrator gets upset when she knows the hibiscus is not like the one's from her old home. This upsets her because she probably misses things that she was used to before. The author uses that paragraph to show the narrator is strong and won�t give up on making things the way they were but also showing that she'll try to adapt to her new home. The author does this to show that you should keep trying at something that you love. The narrator will keep trying when the geese fly back and the hibiscus is budding. So the author is saying try if you fail and set goals to never give up.	2	2		2																					
2857	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons.	0	0		0																					
2859	4	When she moved to america she saw all the beautiful flowers that were out in the spring she saw a blossom that caught her attention it was called hibiscus. She felt it could with it that she went to the florist to see if they had it. Back were she could they grew wild, jittering out from the cracks in ceizors walls the blossom remind her of her grandmother its long gray hair freshly wased	0	0		0																					
2861	4	She will go back to where she started. Its a circle and she will be back the next year where she began.	0	0		0																					
2863	4	I believe that the author concludes the story with this paragraph. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again,� ecause that flower budding would make her feel confident about everything. The reason I think this is because that flower reminds her of past time memories of her homeland. It�s basically like she has a little peice of home in her new home. An example that represents this is, �Not like the kind we had before,� this is explaining the new hibiscus is similar, but not the same as the one from home, so this reminds her of home. This is the reason I believe the author ends the story the way they do,	2	1		2																					
2865	4	Everything in the story is about to change. The winter will change to spring, the snow will melt and vanish, the geese will return, the hibiscus will bud, Saeng will also change and mature as well, Saeng is just like the hibiscus plant as the plant is out of place on the road, Saeng is out of place in the new country and she must adapt like the hibiscus plant. The plant looks different in the United States than in Vietnam because it matured and grew. That is what Saeng must do she must mature and grow in this new country. For example Saeng observed how different the plant looked in the shop window then in did in her home country. She was observing herself and how different she appeared as well. The reason for putting the paragraph at the very end was to show that she had matured already and putting it at the end to show that she had grown. Putting it at the beginning would not give the same effect. The hibiscus plant was able to sustain the harsh winters change. Saeng is able to do that as well and she made the silent vow to take that test again when she has matured just as the things around her have.	3	3		3																					
2868	4	The author concluded the story with the paragraph because it shows that Saeng was not prepare for this test, because she was not accustom to the place, but after seeing the plants that reminded her of home, and knowing that the spring time is when more will blossom, she will be ready to take the test over.	1	1		1																					
2869	4	The reasoning for concluding this story this way is to state that the season of the flowers is over and is to be held off until the spring so that give the author a point where he/she can end the story and begin on a new one for when the flowers come back in the spring so inconclusion this is why the author ends the story with this paragraph that they chose.	1	1		1																					
2871	4	"The author concludes the story with that paragraph because of how it related to when Saeng failed her driving test. But she was determind to take it over when she feels shes. ready and the paragraph sad ""in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take this test again."""	1	1		1																					
2872	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� which was wrote by Minfong Ho. I believe she put it there because it keeps you asking questions. I think because her mom was so disappointed with her that maybe she can change things and make things better.	1	1		1																					
2875	4	The arhuror concludes this story with this paragraph to show people that the story or people in the story have a thing for nature or like writing about nature like whats in nature the change or maybe this story is about nature at its best.	0	0		0																					
2877	4	The author concludes with this paragraph because it fits along with a lot of the story and sums it up well. In the story the hibiscus means a lot to Saeng. Durring the story she relates a lot of memories to the hibiscus. It reminds her of her home and her past so it plays an important role. When she planting it it�s winter and the hibiscus hasen�t bloomed yet. So by saying that she will take the test again when it is budding is like saying she will take the test again when its budding again. She is pretty much acting the same as the flower once again showing its importance. And thats why I think the author ended with that paragraph.	2	2		2																					
2880	4	because she thinks she will do better in the spring for some reason I dont know if @CAPS1 because she will be in a better mood then and it will look more like her home place	1	1		1																					
2882	4	I think that the author concludes the story with that paragraph because know matter what she said or did she had to git the flower because it remids her of where she used to live and how It was there so she stared to cry and the test was not to buy the flower and not to cry and that in th spring she is going to grow her own flower. That is what I think the test is about.	1	1		1																					
2883	4	She see if her plant will survive then the winter just like the ones back at home.. And she things will be the. Same.	1	1		1																					
2884	4	Its the start of a new life. She has a new new school and a new plant, Its is like she has a connection to the plant, when it grow she grows stronger and more confident. That�s when she said when they come back when the hibiscus is budding she will be ready for that test.	1	1		1																					
2887	4	The author concludes the story with this  paragraph  because,Saeng  is determined  to  pass the test. She knows when its spring and the hibiscus is budding, she will retake the test I think she wants to retake the test because  the  hibiscus makes her think about her homeland. It makes her feel more confident. She thinks she can pass it next time. The hibiscus  makes  her  happy and overwhelmed. She wants to retake the test. She�s sure she will do better next time.	1	2		2																					
2888	4	I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because, it shows that if that type of flower could bloom in different places and go through natural changes than so can she. To me the flower is a symbol to the author that encourages her to keep trying. No matter if you have to start all over and doing it again. It�s just this time you will know and would have learned from the past mistakes. Just as a flower blooms one spring it dies in the winter and then comes again in the spring. That�s the same as Saeng failing that test that year she can go back next time and take it again.  	2	2		2																					
2892	4	"The author concluded ""Winter Hibiscus"" with this paragraph to emphasize a new life and new chances for the main character. The future setting of the paragraph, spring, symbolizes rebirth & another start from the cold, hard winter. The author takes this to heart including, more events which enhance this symbolized meaning. the author has uses structured choice to carry her toughts. Recreate, when to convey the theme of rebirth, the author uses words like ""the gesse return"" and ""take the test again"" which add to the importance at the home. Also, the literal action of the ""hibiscus is budding"" @CAPS1 rebirth. In winter the plant is dormant & less colorful, but in the spring the plant shows rebirth through about color in its buds. The author finally conveys the theme of rebirth by ending with this paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2896	4	"The author chose this paragraph because it fit right like a good conclusion showed for example the word again it means that you did something already and it's over but you miss so you retry what you miss, but in the paragraph it's talking about the nature and how they want to test it!(""again"")!."	0	0		0																					
2897	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because it still shows how determined saeng is to take the test again and pass it this time. By ending this story with the paragraph the author is creating suspense is probably for a sequel of another story.	1	1		1																					
2901	4	"The author probably concludes the story with that paragraph to show that Saeng has realized she needs to be confident, and to also end the story on a good note. Also, the author wraps things familiar with Saeng, and things native to her new home into the last paragraph. At the beginning of the story, the girl seemed very upset and lost in this country, and missed her home greatly. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" But once she gets home, and tells her mother she failed her driving test, she seems to feel better. Towards the end, after she planted the hibiscus, she sees geese and she feels as if they're ""almost familiar"". The paragraph that ends the selection does a good job of tying her past (the hibiscus), her present (the geese & the snow) and the drama of the story (failing the test) into one."	2	3		3																					
2903	4	I think the author concludes this paragraph in this story to describe how grown up Saeng is now since it doesn�t look like she leaves with her mom anymore. To the author probably wants to emphasize the reader @CAPS1 of Saeng, now on for she probably leave since she doesn't leave with her mom anymore. In what happen was just her past and will be memorable to Saeng.	0	0		0																					
2904	4	"The author uses that passage to end the story to show that Saeng will try to adopt. When Saeng smells the Hibiscus �The familiar fragrance filled her lungs and Saeng [she] could almost feel. The light sounds of her grandmother�s long gray hair"" This @CAPS1 that Saeng was looking for things that were familiar to her and reminded her of her homeland. The fact that Saeng paid over nineteen dollars for a plant also @CAPS1 how much she missed her homeland. ""d-d failed the test that Saeng paid.� @CAPS1 the reader that she attempted to adapt to her new home but failed. This makes her sad and causes her to miss the way things used to be. at the end of the story she said that ""I [she] will late the test again."" seeing the familiar hibiscus and geese leaver knowing that they will return gives Saeng hope. the last time in the story @CAPS1 the regard they @CAPS2 will always remember her homeland  "	3	2		3																					
2908	4	In the story the �winter Hibiscus� by minfong Ho the writers ends with a paragraph that concludes the story. One of the reasons she concluded with the last paragraph the @CAPS1 she did is because it tells the reader that Saeng  @CAPS1 not given up on her drivers test. �� Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� This explains in more details when  she will take the test Again another years on is because it leaves the reader to think how the rest of the story will go.	1	2		2																					
2911	4	The hibiscus flower is viewed as a symbol of hope and a reminder of their homeland. When Saeng first sees it in the florist shop, she is taken over by memories of home and how all the flowers grew freely there. I believe the author wants the new flower to represent an opportunity for Saeng and her mother to do the same in @LOCATION1. Planting the flower is a representation of adaptation, since they have moved to a new land. Saeng seems to be using it as a motivation when she says �when this hibiscus is blooming, I will take the test again.� The paragraph provides closure and a sense of hope, which is an excellent note to end on.	2	2		2																					
2912	4	the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because it tells that if you fail the first their is always a second time just like the @CAPS1 I dies in the winter and it come back alive in the spring.	1	1		1																					
2915	4	The author includes that paragraph at the end of the story because it connects Saeng to the geese and plant with symbolism. For saeng, the snow represents her troubles adjusting to @LOCATION1, the geese show her that she is, even now adapting to her new homeland when she geese seem familiar. The @CAPS1 hibiscus was pretty but the new @CAPS2 hibiscus, which symbolizes her since she came to @LOCATION1, is adopted to the mre resilient and withstand the snow which symbolizes her problems adapting to @LOCATION1. For saeng, the hibiscus budding again represents her becoming stronger and overcoming her troubles. She wants to go take the test again when she is stronger. The author concluded the story with this paragraph to connect the Hibiscus budding with Saeng overcoming her obstacles. 	3	3		3																					
2921	4	The author conclude the story with this paragraph to show that saeng is going to retake the test over when all these things happen. Saeng shows that she is not going to give up, and that she is going to keep trying. The hibiscus is a lucky charm to her to keep during the test to strive her to pass the test. In addition, the author also conclude the story with this paragraph to show saeng personal thoughts, and how she feels about this test. In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, is a indication that it time to give the test another try. In conclusion, the paragraph is a indication that saeng is never going to forget.	2	1		2																					
2925	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because it shows he determination. In the spring it will be hard for the hibiscus to survive because its a winter hibiscus and it also has determination.	1	1		1																					
2931	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because he wanted the readers to know that Saeng was going to take the test over again.	1	1		1																					
2932	4	When Saeng said that she will go and take the test over next year. She means trying to plant the plants all over again. When Saeng says �Here, let me help, mother. Right then you know that Saeng does want to help with the plants after all.	0	0		0																					
2943	4	In the text, when the mother said �It�s flowers aren�t as pretty, but it�s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That�s what matter� This sentences shows that Saeng is just like the flowers. They�re strong to live through the winter, that shows they are very pretty and strong in the spring. This amphasis that Saeng will be strong and more confident in the spring. That�s why the author put it in at the end. It�s also reflected to the flower, how they�re pretty and strong in spring	2	1		2																					
2945	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph to illustrate the true meaning of the hibiscus. The hibiscus is symbolic to Saeng in several ways, but the most important is that it represents change and growth and the ability to overcome obstacles. Upon seeing it, she is overcome with childhood memories and sentimentality. However, she must adjust to her new home if she wants to grow as a person. She will survive here, just as the hibiscus will survive through the winter. Also, Saeng vows that �in the spring� when �this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� She is determined to succeed, and the hibiscus itself represents triumph over obstacles.  It stands for survival and endurance through life�s disappointments and challenges, from failing a driver�s test to starting a new life in a strange and foreign country. The author�s choice to end the story with this paragraph exhibits Saeng�s ultimate understanding of her strength through the symbol of the hibiscus.	3	3		3																					
2947	4	The author includes the story with this paragraph because since Saeng failed her drivers test for the first time when the hibiscus starts to bud it will represent a change in her life. Also, Saeng use to have hibiscus flowers at her old home in Vietnam so when the flower buds it could show that she has a new home. 	1	1		1																					
2949	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph to show she is not giving up on her new home or forget her old one. She shows she isn�t giving up when she brings home the flower to plant. That also shows she will not forget her old home. Also when she says, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� That shows she is giving her new home another shot and isn�t giving up. Another example is when it says, �Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� Here she is accepting the changes and giving her new home another chance. She is not giving up on it.	2	2		2																					
2955	4	She compares the paragraph to the story to compare it to school. The test is makeing new friends and doing good on the test and classes. In the paragraph it said �Then I will take that test again.� That is the reason she is comparing that paragraph to school.  	0	0		0																					
2959	4	"I think that the author concludes the story with this paragraph because she seems to led comfortable when she saw the geese and plants the hibiscus in the winter and keeps it from dying. In the story it said,""... their faint banks clear and -yes- familiar to Saeng now"". I think this is explaining how she feels after seeing the geese fly over head because she uses to see that in Vietnam. Also, ""when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding�, she gains more confidence because she leds like she�s back in Vietnam. All in all, that's why the author concludes the story with that paragraph."	2	2		2																					
2963	4	The author concludes the story of the paragraph because, the author would like to finish the last sentence of the story. Also at the last of the paragraph is when she is visualizing and putting her effort to the hibiscus. Therefore, her thoughts are appreciated to the plant. The author wanted more evidence to the story. For example, when it said, in the spring, when the snow melt and the geese ruturn and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. It includes the winter time for the plant. Also, the @DATE2 and spring the plant comes back, which the character saeng will get it back, and visit it.	1	0		1																					
2970	4	The author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there waste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over again the author could have concluded the story with this paragraph for many reason. I think the author wanted to give an interseting fact about what happens to hibiscus when it snows! for example the author explain how the hibiscus grow and things that are needed for it to grow, like sunlight, water soil, and picking up there watste. Maybe the author figure that explaining that when it snows the process begans all over	0	0		0																					
2972	4	The reason why the said she will wait til spring to take the test again, is to see if she�s still like the bitter melon over the Big-mac.	0	0		0																					
2973	4	The author concludes the end of this story with this paragraph pecause this saying to take the test again. What she means by this that she will have to do the same thing next year. She will have to addapt to life just like the hibiscus did. She is also saying to do her beest because everything in the world is by living to you fullest. So its aas a good conclusion for Story.	1	1		1																					
2983	4	"The author concludes with this story to show how Saeng is ready to accept her new life. Once the geese and the hibiscus are back she feel like she's at home. When she feels more at home is when she will be ready to take the test again. The text states �run and the geese return"" this hibiscus is budding , then I will take that test again�. Clearly the geese and hibiscus remind her of home.Once she feels at home, she will feel at ease. Thats why the author concluded with this pasage."	1	2		2																					
2993	4	I think the author concluded the story with this paragraph because it shows that the character in the story is starting to adapt to her new country. In the beginning of the story the character � Saeng� is feeling homesick and has not adapted to her new country. She is on her way home from her driver�s test, which she just failed, and on the way she sports a hibiscus in a flower shop. The hishiscus is special to her because it reminds her of her home country of Vietnam. For Saeng the hibiscus represents comfort in time of disappoint, connection to her past experiences and ability to overcome obsticales. Saeng has not adjusted to this change in her life and it has affected her badly. The author concluded the story with this paragraph because he wanted to show the reader that there will always be changes and obsticates in your life but there will always be something or someone that will help you overcome it. The author shows this by concluding the story with this paragraph and showing the reader that saeng was the hibiscus as her way of overcoming and when she is ready and she has ajusted she will take her driving test again.	3	2		3																					
3001	4	The author put that sentence in the story because she feels that will give her enough time to get the test right and cause she likes geese.	1	1		1																					
3005	4	The author uses symbolism to convey a different message. Saeng said in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, and then I will take that test again. The author uses the hibiscus to symbolize Saeng gets older like the hibiscus, that then she will be ready to take that test again. The author uses symbolize to convey more of the story.	2	2		2																					
3009	4	In the short story �Winter Hibiscus� a young girl named Saeng moves away from home. This short story is the girl is trying to adapt to the new lifestyle and changes.	1	1		1																					
3017	4	"The author of ""winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story determined to pass the test after the winter is over and the flower is budding. This shows the correction between the plant and the narrator and the hardships of each. The winter represents an obstacle for the flower, but it will live through it to thrive in the spring. This gives the author confidence that she too can make it through her hardships to thrive. Another hardship that she and the hibiscus both @CAPS1 is being ""root bound."" The author misses her home oF Vietnam very much. However, both oF them must and will adOpt to their new environments.."	3	2		3																					
3019	4	The author Minfong Ho concluded the story �Winter Hibiscus�, with that certain paragraph to show that Saeng would not give up, that she was determined to pass the driving test and also in a way get used to her new home. It is kind of like a motivation, �when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� The motivation is the flower, bringing back good people memories that made her happy and believed in her. Minfong also concluded the story the way he/she did to say, by next year Saeng will start fresh. To become happy with her new life and not dwell on her past. Saeng says, �.. in the spring...� it�s the beginning of a new year to start over, and rejoice. This was a really good way to end the story, because it sets a positive vibe. It�s letting the readers know that Saeng is a strong person, who can remember the past but move on to a new day and life. And I think the author is trying to point out that everyone should have the strength to do the same.  	3	3		3																					
3020	4	She ended it with that paragraph because she wanted to prove even though she misses the �old centry� she will adapt and survive.	1	1		1																					
3021	4	I think the author conclades the story with this paragraph because it sounds hopeful. She wasn�t adapting to her new home very well and that made her feel hopeless.Saeng failed her driving test which only made things worse for her. To make things better, she bought a hibiscus that reminded her of her old home. She found the plant to be very comforting and it helped her get passed the tough times. In the last paaragraph, Saeng is looking forward to the spring so she can retake the test and hopefully pass it this time. I think the paragraph provides a feeling of hopefulness which is way the author concluded the story the way they did.	2	2		2																					
3023	4	Clearly From rending the story Winter @CAPS1, the author @CAPS2 this phrase �when they come Back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test Again� in the story because the passage relates to the title of the story Winter @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
3032	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she says �Then I Will take that test again� she believes in the Flowers. she and the Flowers both adapte to there circumstances. They both being determined to @CAPS1 in @CAPS2 places. They both overcome obstacles. Maybe she wants to see what lays ahead. she hopes she is right about the Flowers maybe, she likes the spring.	2	1		2																					
3034	4	The reason why the author concludes this type of senerario is simply because the author has a pain to cross and or a situation in this particular author you know son but if you get it straight you�ll open your eyes and see that its your time to shine you might as well grab it before you loose your chance you only get one day to prove you are worthy to the people.	0	0		0																					
3038	4	I think the author concludes the story with this paraghragh because when she told her mom she failed her test she was crying, But I think it was deeper than that. I think she missed home so much that she couldn't concentrate. She had to cry about something because she didn't want to let her mom know that she misses home.	1	1		1																					
3039	4	When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concludes the story because as if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel.	0	0		0																					
3047	4	The authar concludes the story with the paragraph they because it shows saeng determination and her overcoming her obstacles of being new in a country. With all of the doubts saeng had right after her test it is very big of her to come to this conclusion of retaking the test, �Here, let me help you mother,she offered� (HO). With her mom comforting her and telling her it is @CAPS1, gives saeng the boost she needs to help her mother and think to herself that she can�t let just one thing hold her back in life. the support saeng has she will definetly pass the test the next time.	2	1		2																					
3055	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph because its show signs of hope and that knowing that spring will come again. For the family and that everything will be ok. For them also. The girl will makes friends also when spring comes.	1	1		1																					
3057	4	In the end of the story they say that she will take the test over again, in the spring when the geese come back from the winter fly. What they are saying is that she will make a fresh start in the spring when the geese come back, so she would just be starting all over again fresh new start to a new year and a new time to study for the big test and time to regroup from the last test that she took and failed the test she will just get a new start and a new chance to do something over again. Her mom was in disbelief when she found out that she failed the test, her mom said to her that it will be ok and you can take it over again, in a new season,	1	2		2																					
3059	4	The author of the story concludes the text with that paragraph to end on a good note and show hope for the future. First, throughout the story Saeng felt lonely and depressed because she missed her home in Vietnam. With all this depression Saeng saw the winter hibiscus that reminded her of her childhood memories. She felt a little hope for adapting to the new environment and new life. The flower represented the light and hope for the future. Next, it shows perserverance factor in the story Saeng fails her drivers test and came home feeling unacomplished. When she says she will retake the test in the spring when the hibiscus blooms it shows perserverance and never giving up. Lastly, the author ended the passage with that paragraph to end on a good note and show a positive outlook on life. No matter where you come from with love and perserverance you can overcome any obstacle. Whether it be your school, tests or home with a little hardwork and faith you can achieve.	3	3		3																					
3060	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph. �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� to show thatshe will do this once she  has gotten use to the change of her new country. When she says, �When the geese return� their faint honks and flying overhead are familiar to her now season upon season. Also when the hibiscus is budding because this will remind her of her home in Vietnam seeing flower and hearing these geese will give her the confidence and encouragement to retake the drivers test.	2	2		2																					
3062	4	The author of �Winter Hibiscus �decided to end the story with this paragraph because its like a new beginning for saeng. In saeng moves and fails the test .The winter hibiscus comforts her from the memories of where she used to live. It gives her hope and in the winter it wouldn�t be as nice as it would be in the spring. Spring is also time for new beginnings because in the winter everything dies and comes back to life in spring .saeng feels she would take the test as a new beginning. From my personal experience I always do spring cleaning because I want to begin fresh. Spring is also filled with fresh air and gives me inspiration to do good. This could be why saeng wants to take the test in the spring time. Therefore the author of �Winter Hibiscus �decided to end the story with that paragraph because they wanted to show how saeng wanted a new beginning.  	3	2		3																					
3064	4	The author, Minfong  Ho, concludes the story with this paragraph for many reasons. The  �budding hibiscus� symbolizes comfort for her. When moving to @LOCATION1 she couldn�t take all her friends a possessions with her, but she could bring memories. The flower reminds her of home, which is comforting after she failed her drivers test. In addition, the �geese returning� symbolizes a new beginning. After being away for so long, the geese returning ushers  in springs a time to start all over after a dreasy  winter. Finally �;,.then I will take that test again.� @CAPS1 that one should never give up. Even though ve was hard for her to adapt to a new  country, she made friends a tried @CAPS2 foods, like a Big @CAPS3. Therefore, Minfong Ho concludes the story with the paragraph to show comfort, new beginnings  a never give up.	3	3		3																					
3073	4	At the end of the story, winter Hibiscus, the author's concluding paragraph shows many of the aspects of the story in a summary, Saeng is determined to go back to the drivers test and is open to a new beginning. The author used these concluding words in the paragraph to express the hope in Saeng of a better beginning and to show her determination to pass the drivers test. The author ties the objects in-a story to represent this determination and new beginning. For example, the hibiscus is a reminder of her glorious home, spring is the time she picks because it is a new beginning, and the geese returning show the determination of her and her to resolve to become new and better.	2	2		2																					
3080	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphisise the theme that changes in life are hard to adjust to. Saeng has moved to @LOCATION1 and longs for home. The flowers in the greenhouse reminds her of where she grew up and her grandmother. ""A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng's eyes now swept over her."" Saeng cannot look at the flowers without crying. She tells her mom that she did not pass the test but in the last paragraph she vowed to herself that by spring she will. The author is giving us insight to Saeng's character. We now know that eventhough it is difficult for Saeng to let go of what she knows and love, she will have the strength to make it in a new world.?"	2	2		2																					
3083	4	"The author includes this paragraph because Saeng is starting anew in a new country. In this country she misses her homeland and the hibiscus reminds her of so. Saeng took a test and failed and in the winter, flowers fail but they bloom again in the spring. When the hibiscus blooms Saeng will ""bloom"" and try the test again. Moving can be a hardship especially when it is to place very unfimiliar. People find ways to make themselves promises & to remind them of their old home."	2	2		2																					
3086	4	I believe that the author concluded the story �Winter @CAPS1� with the paragraph that she did in order to imply that Saeng will not give up. By allowing the audience to know that Saeng was very sad about failing the test, but will take the test again infers that Saeng is a determined person. It is my belief that the concluding paragraph was added to convey the feeling that Saeng was determined despite hardships.	2	1		2																					
3088	4	Mingfong Ho closes the story with that paragraph because it shows how far Saeng has come and her determination to persevere. The narrator says, �She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly facing into the distance �(Ho @NUM1). This is when Saeng is recovering from crying and even though she misses her homeland, she wants to adapt and succeed where she is now. The narrator also said, �she found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again� (Ho @NUM1). Being away from her homeland makes Saeng very ??? (not legible)	2	2		2																					
3092	4	The author concludes that failing the test is not the worst thing. She relizes that times change and you can always get another chance, which is explaned in the last paragh that once the hibiscus buds she will take the test again.	1	1		1																					
3094	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph @CAPS1 It mean so many things about her in just one little sentence. For example ""take that test again"" she willing to do it all over again @CAPS1 she love it and want to do it. Also when she said ""in spring; when the snows melts and the gesse return and this hibicous is' budding"" from that when you come back and don't forget about all the things she just list. That why the author concludes the story with this paragraph. "	1	1		1																					
3097	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph or quote to get the readers something to think about at the end of the reading. For example, It lets the reader now that the person will continue to grow plant when the winter is done.	0	0		0																					
3106	4	The author concludes the story with �when they come back, Saeng wowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again�, because he wants to express to the readers that she is willingly determined for what she has to do to accomplish what she has failed. Since she has failed the test the first time she wants to overcome her failure and succede in it so the author wants her to look determined in the end.	1	1		1																					
3110	4	The story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho,is about overcoming adversity. She concludes the story by writing �when they come back [the geese] then I will take that test @NUM1). The main character, Saeng, had been having trouble at school and on her way home had seen an assortment of flowers that were indigenous to her homeland. �Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense it was almost @NUM2) The sight of those flowers namely the hibiscus reminded her of what she lost and offered comfort in the face of the memory. The winter hibiscus could still survive even though it was not in the land where it belonged. Her mother states �It�s flowers aren�t as pretty but it�s strong enough. That�s what @NUM3). Saeng , after hearing this, decides that she could be strong, too, and would try to do her best in school. She would adapt just like the winter hibiscus.	2	2		2																					
3113	4	The author ends the story with this paragraph because he wants to get the point out that the character dosnt want to rush into things she wants to  do right and not take the quick way out.  	0	0		0																					
3118	4	The author included this because she felt that since Saeng failed the test that maybe she should be given a second chance because she tried so hard before. When Saeng says �Nothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.� It made her mom upset because she used alot of money for one plant just so she could feel at home again since she had one when she was at her old home. Eventually her mom say, �It�s a beautiful plant� to make her feel better because she feels bad for how she acted towards her daughter. After all the things Saeng had to go through is the reason the author added the the last passage into the story.	1	1		1																					
3120	4	The authors purpose of this conclusion is that every year when the snow melts and the geese return she will have to again take care of the plant. Thats clear because taking a test is a big responsibility therefore taking care of that plant is also a huge task refering  to taking the test again. this is what the purpose of the concluding sentence meant.	1	1		1																					
3121	4	Because planting flowers and wasting on the garden is @CAPS1 hobby. And without it she can�t think clearly or creating. So there fore waiting until they are back will make her happier also she able to do her work.	0	0		0																					
3125	4	The story was about a girl walking home after failing her driving test and breaking down about her �home� where she no longer lived. After she had broke down, bought the plant, and learned to actually accept the fact that she no longer lived in Vietnam and accepting that she had failed her driving test, she realized that she just has to learn to like it. She also learned that her time will come and she will one day be driving. The reason why the auethor concluded the story with this paragraph is because this is the conclusion of the story. this is where one realizes the important things.	1	2		2																					
3134	4	Saeng vowed silently to herself and to her mother too. Saeng decided to tell her mother what she had done, �she failed the test� probably her mom get upset with her but then she talk to her again. Saeng  mather�s ask her about the plant that she have with her. Saeng said that she buy the plant by @MONEY1. She was sad because she failed the test and when she buy the plant it probalbly makes her feel better. I think the author probably concludes the story with this paragraph because it bring some kind of hope to her, and she probably will pass the test. When she said �then I will take that test again� @CAPS1 makes her to decide to take it agan it could be the plant.	2	1		2																					
3135	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because the author want to show the readers that Saeng will want to pass her driver licens test. The reason that so the reader show how detirmen Saeng do after the winter The example is that in the story Saeng fail her driver licens and was sad about. The next example is that when she find this flow she know she do it again. This show that the flower help her feel better show that she will do it again. The first example show that she was sad that she fail the test. At the conclusion the author put this statement in the story to show reader tat Saeng will pass the diver licenc test later on.	1	2		2																					
3145	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for a couple of different reasons. The author wants to show with meaning, that the budding of the hibiscus plant will be symbolic. Ho states, �Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits,� This shows meaning because it is currently a point in time where Saeng has to overcome negative circumstances, and with the plant dead it shows symbolically the meaning of the plant. At another point in the story, Saeng realizes that there is much more meaning to the seasons, Ho states, �Through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now,� she is realizing that come spring time when the plant will be healthy and budding, she will be able to succeed and become somehow like a new person.	2	2		2																					
3149	4	In the story Saeng is trying to be ok with her new home. I think the author put that in the story to show that she has not given up. She is going to keep trying to adjust to her new home. Saeng wants to adjust but she misses her old home too much. That is why she is waiting till spring to try again.	2	1		2																					
3150	4	The author concludes the story with that like, to leave the reader guessing. The she means that she is determined to live up to her past, and get through it. The paragraph leaves the reader to wonder is she got through it the following year. He describes the snow melting, and geese coming back as change which is exactly is what she hopes to achieve. The author was trying to show how she can change, and grow just like her plant.	2	2		2																					
3153	4	I think she concluded with this statement because she doesn�t know if she will pass but she isn�t giving up on the test and will try to pass it again when her flower grows back. Right now she feels bad and the plant helped to cheer her up so when she sees the plant next year she wants to take the test.The plant is like a sign of good luck. I think she concluded with this paragraph because it leaves you with the idea not to give up when times are hard keep trying.  	1	1		1																					
3158	4	The author concludes this paragraph to the story because, seasons change, plant don�t most likely grow during winter time. So you learn a lesson and take it as it is and a wait until the next time you learn basically the same lesson, when the right time comes.	1	1		1																					
3167	4	The author concludes with that paragraph because it expresses and continues the theme of perserverance and adapting to change. The conclusion mentions the �test� again. From the reading, one can conclude that this test that the author refers to is Saeng�s confrontation of memories of home without feeling the breakdown from loss. Saeng says earlier in the story that she �failed the test�, having broken down in tears after looking at all the Familiar plants that had been at home. By concluding with this paragraph which says she will take the test again, it shows that Saeng is going to continue to try to adapt to her new home and feel at peace here, instead of feeling the tremendous loss of her old home. It shows the theme of perserverance because she is going to take the test again and try to overcome the feeling of sorrow.	3	3		3																					
3172	4	The authoR ends the STORY this way because their trying To show that Saeng will be dedicated To the hibiscus gardening and once she proves herself she will have passed the test. It also shows that she wants her heritage to be a major part of her life by growing their nations flower 	0	0		0																					
3182	4	"The author of this story was smart to end it by saying she will take the test again in the spring, when every thing bloms. This girl just  failed her driving test she dose not want to take it right away. The blomming of the hibiscus symbolizes her old life at her old home and it is also symbolizing a new start when it bloms. This will give her the confodence to pass her driving test and make he excited to get a new start on the year. ""Spring is when the snows melt and geese return�. This quote from this paragraph states that the snow will melt away and the geese will come back home, just like she wants to go home and fells contible, at home you are contible. The author ended this story of this girl, Saeng, with hope and drive to do what she wants to do. That is why it was smart to end the story like they  ended it.  "	2	3		3																					
3183	4	The hibcus as the author has reveat to the audience is a beautiful flower who in the story is the memories of a young girl who has fail the test knowing she was to depress for her failing the test. The flower helps as a symbol of encourage to the sad girl in her most tragrant event and shows how a little flower gives comfort to the girl.The girl Saeng vowed to demonstrate that when she overcomes the sad memories. She�ll be able to be capable to prove she will pass, after she feels ok about the situation she is experiment with her destroy life after have to come to a different country where you mast have a @PERCENT1 of capacity and it�s logical that the adaptation of the girl is not going to be right away. In othe words, the author message it�s to motivate the people who has problems in their lifes and that life it�s not give up. Instead you should keep working hard until you get it. In conclusion working Hard and @CAPS1 give up it�s a part of our life and it�s up to our selves to overcome failing	2	2		2																					
3184	4	"In the Story the @CAPS1 concluds the story with the sentance ""When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again."" I think he ends it this way because she has accepted that she failed or lost but is willing to try again to accomplish her goal and ""take that test again"". Also she is making a promise, or a vow to her self and to not give up on her goal."	2	1		2																					
3185	4	The author concludes the story with he paragraph because they both go togather the away there both about things going and leaving the season changing. like they don�t won�t to let go but they knew there be back soon. Thats why the author combided the story with the paragraph.	1	1		1																					
3187	4	The author concluded the story in the paragraph. She doesn�t want Saeng vows the whole room to herself where it�s quite when she is taking the test.	0	0		0																					
3188	4	She is  saying that ryt now, is not the right time to table the tst, she is saying that she is going to wait to care back until spring, when the flowrs we blooming to take the test, @CAPS1 she is so acentric abought the exotic flowers, She can�t stand to do it now, when the time isn�t right. So she is saying that she is going to wait until the time is right to take the test.	0	0		0																					
3193	4	"The reason why the author concludes this paragraph is to show saeng that she will be waiting for them to grow back and she will try again for her test. Hibiscus means a lot to her, and will keep trying because she doesnt want her mother disappointed in her again. Example of wher saeng felt shame ""her mother stared at her incredulously.

3194	4	In �Winter Hibiscus,� by minfong Ho, the author concludes the story with this paragraph: �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and geese return and this hibiscus is buddling , then I will take the test again,� @CAPS1 author concludes the story in this way because it is somewhat of a cliffhanger. In the story, @CAPS2 is upset about failing her driving test and she has just moved from Vietnam to the united states and so she is a little homesick. She sees a familiar plant, and so she purchases it for nineteen dollars because it cheers her up ??? reminding being alike the plants in Vietnam. By ending the story like this, you know that Saeng hasn�t given up and that she is going  to try and pass the drivers license test again. But what you don�t know is the end result of whether she passes or not and so it is a cliffhaofer. That is why the author ended the story in this way.	2	2		2																					
3198	4	I think that the author concludes the story she fails the driving test, so they added she was going to take it over. And maybe the plant is or would be good luck to her after the snow melts and the geese return it would be a fresh Start. Also it would be nice after she descovered the plant.	1	1		1																					
3201	4	She going to take the test agan @CAPS1 she feels like She needs to and She @CAPS2  when the snow melts and geese came back that means She wants to take the in the Spring. 	1	1		1																					
3206	4	"The Author concudes this story with paragraph because She loves her garden. She concudes it because the story is about then and their garden and it eventually turns cold leaving them nothing to do untill Spring. Itsuggest they have strong feelings For what they do as it says ""in In spring when the snow nelts and the gese return and this hibiscus budding"" hears she wants to take the tst to overcome and prove She can take care of her Garden."	0	0		0																					
3212	4	The reason why this author includes this story with this paragraph is because it is still talking about saeng and that is more like her and that she has a mind like a butterflye that was trapped a burst out with this open the Saeng and her mom had but a tennage girl me and saeng we kind relate to the same thing.	0	0		0																					
3216	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wants to show how some some people vowed silently because the don�t want to express themselves. Also maybe because they are not very mistful of people even themself. One day I was  like that I didn�t want to talk to anybody. All I want to do is sit in my room and think. Think about my life were I am going to go after i die. I just woulnd sit in my room in the dark wondering if in my room in the dark wondering if I  would come back in another body or will my soul roam the earth. But think I starting think that I am a kid, I got a wonderful like a head of me. I when I get to the one where I need to think about then I would . So  I started talking to everybody again	0	0		0																					
3226	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" at the end of the story the author writes ""when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, In the spring, when the snow melt and geese return and this hibiscus Is budding, then I will take the test again."" The reason why the author said that Is because she Is trying to tell the readers to get right back up and do it again, If you fell once there Is no harm and trying again. When its spring and the birds aren't flying south, she promise to take the drive's test. After failing a driver test Saeng buys a flower at a florIst that remInded her of Vietnam. She takes it home and put it in the garden. Told her mother that she fail, Saeng's mother was very understand and told her maybe next time In conclusion the author �write the last paragraph as a moral to never give up and keep trying until you accomplish your goals in life.  "	1	2		2																					
3230	4	"When they  come back, Saeng vowed to silently herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and  this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again. The author concluded this story in such a way that it makes the reader ask questions much live in the �@CAPS1�s @ORGANIZATION1� when there was a modernist way to interprentle means of a sty by makeing the reader ask questions instead of that beig a moral to the story. For example in the �@CAPS1�s @ORGANIZATION1"" the main character @PERSON1 run away and all are could get as a slaming door. Much live in this story there is a twist in that what test is the main character talking about? Is she goig to try to move ww friends? is this live a resolution she is making to herself? also this leaves the reader wanting more of the story so that they @MONTH1 go back and even read it again."	1	1		1																					
3233	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because she wanted to get her point across. also because she wanted to create an under standing of the complexitier of the passage. The author wanted the reader to feel her message as if they were there to witness it.	0	0		0																					
3238	4	Minfong Ho concluded �Winter Hibiscus� with the lines �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again� to show that there is always hope for better things to come. Saeng had become sad because she remembered her home in Vietnam. She longed for her natural home and familiarity. Her missed memories agonizingly hurt Saeng because she was now for away and in a different world. However, the author started to reveal hints that @ORGANIZATION1 would accept @LOCATION2 and find come childhood memories there too. �Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and �yes- familiar to Saeng now.� Already, Saeng was growing familiar with her surrounding area in @LOCATION2. Her hibiscus would keep her @CAPS1 culture, tradition, and memories alive, as the geese would help her feel happy and accustomed in @LOCATION2. As one kept her @CAPS1 and �@CAPS3 culture alive through memories, she would continue a successful life and pass her test. That is why Minfong Ho ended �Winter Hibiscus� with the particular paragraph.	3	2		3																					
3244	4	The author concude the story with that paragraph because its what she solemely promoted herself.	0	0		0																					
3245	4	In �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the author�s purpose in concluding the story with �When they come back, Saeng  vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then l will take that test again,� was to show how the hibiscus and the other plants in the store symbolized Saeng. When Saeng enters the store, she becomes overwhelmed by how many things she had forgotten about living in Vietnam. �Plants that she had not even realized she had known but forgotten grew her back into her childhood world.� This is when Saeng associates herself and her childhood with these plants. When she sees another plant she knows in a pot, she thinks to herself, �How strange to seat in a pot back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in the brick walls or between filed roofs. �This symbolizes her, because out of her home, she seems to feel strange and caged, too, while at home in Vietnam she was much more free-spirited. The hibiscus plant, when Saeng takes it home, is described by her mother as strong enough to make it through the cold months�. Saeng identifies herself with this description, and so decided that when the hibiscus is done dealing with the bad stuff, she will have, also, and will have budded and grown just like her plant. Then, she will be ready to achieve her goal.	3	3		3																					
3254	4	I thinks that the author concludes the story with the given paragraph to show that she is similar to the hibiscus and geese. First, the geese and hibiscus both have a goal, which is to survive the winters. Geese fly south for the winter to stay warm. This is similar to Saeng worse thing both moved to a different environment where they must adapt. Also, Saeng must experience winter along with the hibiscus. The hibiscus needs tobe strong, to overcome winter, from this, it shows Saeng is like her hibiscus because she needs to be strong to overcome the test. If her hibiscus can overcome it�s test, winter then she can survive to cangner her own.	2	3		3																					
3260	4	I think The Author finish the story of with that @CAPS1 the girls see�s this plant As A symbol of straidth And fAith so she will tAke the test Next year When it comes Back @CAPS1 she truly likes the plant And she hopes it will Bring her lack.	1	1		1																					
3262	4	I think the author writes this because whatever test she has to take she wasn�t ready for before but now whenever the geese return and the hibiscus return the she will be ready to take the test. Maybe she wasn�t mentally prepared. So inconclusion I think when she says the geese and the hibiscus return the she will take the test and maybe she wasn�t physicaly and mentally prepared for it. 	1	1		1																					
3266	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph, ""When they came back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again to emphasize that you can overcome a defeat or failure by waiting until the ""season"" come again for you to re-endure. Basically, the hibiscus(a plant) meant much to the narrator and her mother which was dying and they dug up a hole to help it to grow, so when it grows again that proves that it will be living better. So when Saeng relates the test that will be her her having the opportunity to past the test. The story with this paragraph symbolizing a new beginning about to take place. This actually means a situation that will came again that will help you to get what is needed out of it that you missed. The story and the paragraph emphasizes what life is about to budling a cycle."	3	2		3																					
3271	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph that she did because it was the end and the start of a new beggining. The author uses the sensens in her story. The winter is the current season and spring is on its way. Although Saeng failed her test in the winter when most things die, she is looking forward to spring to start again on her test. The geese will return and the hibiscus will bud to show spring is here with new life. Saeng will also have new life in her test to pass it this time and drive. The spring season will come and new life will be provided to all.   	2	2		2																					
3275	4	"The story  �Winter Hibiscus"" by Minfong Ho. The author concludes the story in a what seems like incomplete paragraph. The girl Saeng vows to take her driver test over when the spring comes. when Saeng was holding the plant, she felt cold and halpless like how the plant did. ""Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, it's leaves quivering in the wind."" By Saeng's mother reassuring her that she was okay with her choice it made Saeng grow as a person, ""I'm glad you got it."" @CAPS1 mother also says, ""look how root-bound it is, poor thing."" That in a way describes Saeng clinging to stay connected with her country. Saeng�s mother also tells her of now the plant will surely survive. When the spring comes the plant will be just as strong, and so will Saeng. Which is why the author leaves off where she did"	1	3		2																					
3277	4	The author wrote the ending paragraph the way she did for many reasons. The main reason for this is because she wanted to end the story on a lighter note. All throughout the story there was depresing nogistalistic tone that made the reader yearn for the past. The author wanted to put on emphisis on being strong even though you @MONTH1 not enjoy where you are at. Also the author wanted to show the strength of the main of the main character Saeng. Even though she has just failed a test in a new, strange world she still wishes to continue pushing foward. This adds more demension the the character and makes her less static and more dynamic. This is a very good story to read if you are homesick and need something to push you forward.	2	2		2																					
3278	4	The author concludes with that statement because it shows she needs time. She needs time to adjust to her new home like the hibiscus to get some roots in the new soil she is on. When she is at the orchard she sees the hibiscus and has memories of her old home making her cry but yet feel good at the same time.	2	1		2																					
3279	4	I believe the author concludes the that passage in the story to show patintions. Saeng was to wait for spring maybe it will feel like her home town again. She likes the spring better than the winter. She likes the birds the geese return in sping. They go away in winter. That way I believe the author concludes that passage.	1	1		1																					
3286	4	"In the story ""Winter Hibiscus"" the girl Saeng @CAPS1 the drivers test ""I-I failed the test"" said Saeng. She had bought a hibiscus because the flower remined her of some of the memories from home and the hibiscus she had at herhouse. at the end she says that she will retake the test when the geese come back, the snow has melted and the hibiscus is budding. She does this I think because she needs time to just think things through to just remember back home and to make a hibiscus garden. The hibiscus in this story is just like Saeng. They both did something wrong or @CAPS1 something Saeng failed the test and the hibiscus was constrited to a pot. But they both are going to change the bad thing.."	1	2		2																					
3290	4	 The author concludes the story with this paragraphto show that saeng is determined. She says that she is going to take the test again which shows that she is determined. Even though saeng failed her driverd test she is not going to give up.	1	1		1																					
3302	4	The author concludes the story with they paragraph that they did because it's about the same thing that they opened the story with.  To introduce the story, the author tells about Saeng failing her drivers test, and then seeing a familiar plant that she wants to buy. The middle of the story is about how she is having a hard time adapting to her new home. So to conclude the story, the author puts that Saeng will take her drivers test again, once the flowers starts budding, and the geese come out. The flower and the geese remind her of home, so this tells you that thinking of her home, and the objects that make her feel at home, comfort her, and help her overcome obstacles.	2	2		2																					
3306	4	I think the author concludes this story wit this ending paragraph because the story is all about how  she feels comforted in the plants and she wants to wait until the weather breaks and the geese to come back to take her test. I think she wants to wait that way she will be more comfortable with her surroundings and she can clear her mind and do her best on the test.	1	1		1																					
3315	4	The author concludes the story with that paragraph because It makes people want to read the next story to see How she close on a the test. In the story she failed the test now that she changed she wants to retake the test because she knows she can do @PERSON1 now than before.	1	1		1																					
3316	4	Cause every thing that is in this paragraph is in the story somewere. So it really intwines to gether. She learns to adapt to her new home land as dose the plant.  	1	1		1																					
3321	4	The author concludes this story with that paragraph to show the readers she was knocked down but she is going to get back up again and take the test again. This is also a very good way to end the story because it shows she is very determined to pass that test and won�t give up and will do anything to pass it.	1	1		1																					
3325	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� for several reasons, @CAPS1, Saeng decides that she is determined to pass her driving test just like the hibiscus. Saeng�s mother says that it is �strong enough to make it through,� and Saeng decides to be strong like the hibiscus and make it through and pass the test. Next, the reason the geese are mentioned in the final paragraph is to tie in the fact that she is getting used to @LOCATION1 because the geese �sound familiar.� As much as she misses her old home, she is adapting. Finally, one can conclude that because she mentions the plant, which symbolizes her homeland and the geese, which symbolizes her new home, that as much as she misses her old home, she�s starting to get used to her new country and she recognizes that she ispart of it. She knows that letting her past get in the way of her will not help her pass the test and, like the plant and the geese, she will return again.	3	3		3																					
3327	4	I think the author ended the story like that because she enjoys to see the geese and she loves the spring and wants to take the test and pass. Sh is studying for it in the mean time.	1	1		1																					
3328	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because the author feels that saeng will pass the test if she has the hibiscus with her, she thinks that because the hibiscus has something unique about it. And as also gives her memory of where she used to live before she had moved to the @ORGANIZATION1. Saeng had seemed out of place she did not know what to do.	1	1		1																					
3332	4	The author concludes the story with the paragraph they did because it shows how much the main character has grown. She has learned that if a delicate flower like the hibiscus can make it through rough times she can too. nature�s fight for survival is like Saeng�s struggle in a new place. She discovers that you will adapt to your surroundings over time. Then after that time it will feel just like home. The adaption principle is shown throughout this story demonstrate by nature or a child�s life it�s there. Therefore the author would agree that the conclusion of the story illustrates the biological and physical growth of Saeng.	3	2		3																					
3338	4	In the story the author concludes that after shes done her test and there's nothing that to see she'll grow more.	0	0		0																					
3357	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph. He concludes with this paragraph because that�s how the girl feel. She feel that in the spring she can do better then what she did.	1	1		1																					
3375	4	"The author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize the willingness of Saeng to overcome the obstacles and adapt to her new life. The hibiscus discussed in the ending quote describes Saeng�s new hope and determination to succeed in the United States. For example in the text it states,""� its fine petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.� When Saeng had found a plant that seemed to the together her past in Vietnam and her future in @LOCATION3, she was overwhelmed. The hibiscus represents newhope in a seemingly impossible situation. When the hibiscus has blossomed, her world will be open and a new life will be waiting to begin. With this thought realized at the end of the story, the reader understands that Saeng has found new stability and will eventually succeed. In addition, in the text it says, �it felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center just as she had known it would feel.� Saeng�s past memones could be reached when this hibiscus was in new and that served as immense inspiration to her. The author ended the story with Saeng�s new recollection and hope to prove that she had indeed found something helpful and stable in a new world."	3	3		3																					
3376	4	The author concluded the story, �Winter Hibiscus,� with the paragraph she chose because she wanted to portray to her reader that even though Saeng was experiencing a hardship leaving her old home behind, she could still find a good life with new beginning here. In the final paragraph the winter shows represent hard times in the past, while the spring represents a more optimistic future, and a new beginning. Although Saeng was grieving at the lass of her past, she could still find happiness here. In the story she once knew hibiscus cran her did home. She finds hibiscus where she is now and it is a semblance and reminder of her old home. Also, the story says.� Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quite repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now.� This quote leads into the final paragraph and shows her acceptance that she can appreciate happly live in this new home. The final paragraph says,�.. when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.� When things familiar to her and things their remind her of her old home come back, Saeng will have the strength to try to accomplish good things for this new life in a new home again.	3	3		3																					
3384	4	The author uses this as an ending paragraph in the story because the next year at the same time she will take the test of life over again.	0	0		0																					
3386	4	In the story �Winter Hibiscus� by Minfong Ho, the main character is troubled because they moved away from home and the culture, customs and even food are different .Therefore, the main character has difficulty adapting to her new environment. The author concludes the ending statement to show that she will not stop trying to achieve her goal. She wants to take the test again change to see if over time things @MONTH1 have changed. The story is very emotional and expresses a great deal of sorrow that is overcome in the end.	2	2		2																					
3389	4	The author concludes the paragraph when Saeng realizes she can miss her old home, but she needs to adapt to the new place that she is in. Saeng misses the old memories of her homeland �A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng�s eyes now swept over her.� But, she begins to realize that not everything has changed, same things are still familiar. �overhead, a flock of canada geese flew by, the faint honrs clears and �yes- familiar to Saeng now.� When Saeng realizes that not everything has changed she gained the strength to continue her new life in her new country.	2	2		2																					
3390	4	The reason why the author concludes the story with this paragraph is because it was a good way to end the story off. At the end of this they was talkin about how saeng would come back when the snow melt and then she will take the test again.	0	0		0																					
3394	4	The author concludes the story like this because it shows how the main character has been effected by the events or happenings in the story. In the beginning of the story we learn that the main character has failed her driver�s test. Also in the story she had spent a large amount of money just for one plant, in which her mother is shocked about. The reader at that point would expect for her to be very sad and depressed. But because of her grandmother and her homeland she instead surprizes the reader by looking on the brightside of things and saying that when the flower blooms again she will take the test again. This shows the connection between the main character and the plant. Giving the plant a humanlike existence.	3	2		3																					
3395	4	"I believe that the author chose to conclude the story with that paragraph to illustrate the oevrall message of the story. That paragraph sums up the message of determination and overcoming obstacles. Saeng is coming from another country and is facing challenges not only in the garden, but in her life as well. She had to learn how to adjust to her new surroundings and never give up on what she wanted to accomplish. So, by saying ""in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again,� she truly shows her determination and how shes not afraid to overcome obstacles that will face her. "	2	2		2																					
3398	4	There are two reasons why he had conclude the story with this pararagraph. The one reason why the author had conclude the story with the paragraph because Saeng had silently had picked up a Winter Hibiscus so she can have to passed that driving Test. Finally; the last reason why the author had conclude the story with this paragraph because she wants to try her driving Test again so she can passed so she can also drive when she gets down passing it. These two reasons were so confusing to figure out what the author conclude in the story with that sentence.	1	1		1																					
3401	4	In the story Winter Hibiscus when Saeng says that she will take the test again in the spring, so she can walk home and see the flower that she found. Also in the story it mentions that in her past childhood she had seen the same flower in her country, but the next time she takes the driving test she would like to pass. It shows that she was disapointed because in the story it say that she paid over nineteen dollars for the test. Her mother was astionished, and yelled at her for a second. Saeng began crying and her mother calmed to show sympathy for her. Now she has the determination to take the test again. 	1	1		1																					
3413	4	The author concluded the passage with a very powerful statement. �When the geese come back � in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, I will take that test again.� This statement shows renewal and persistance. I think she added this because after realizing the plant can come back time and time again, even after the harsh weather, she knew she could do it too. She vowed to herself that when the day comes again she will be ready to renew  herself and get back on track. It conveys persistance also. The plant doesn�t die each season. It�s hardy and comes back. If the girl can be persistant and come back next year to retake the test, she will be considered persistant. I think the girl wants to be just like flower. She sees it as being indomitable, renewing and beautiful. No matter where the plant is being grown, it will always keep those traits.	2	2		2																					
3417	4	The author included this because she was showing that it was winter and the flower was goin to bloom and the geese were flying here because it is cold. Also the author said that because the story title is called the �Winter Hibiscus� which obviously blooms in the winter so that is why I think the author said what she did.	0	0		0																					
3422	4	I think  the author concluded the story like that is because it was cold outside. I also think that the author is trying to say is that when she wrote this letter it was cold outside and she wouldn�t take the test until it was warm again because of the cold. �In the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this is when the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test over again.� 	0	0		0																					
3426	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because It show what Saeng will be doing and If she will go to school. Saeng didn't want to go school because she will wait For the snow to melt ond the geese return and this hibiscus is bucking, and prefers gardening to school. and garden remind For about her homeland. For @CAPS1 Saeng dug out hole and carefully lowered the winter hibiscus into it. The thing that made her thing about her homeland was the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan, The pungent smell of better melon wafled out. Another @CAPS1 she went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground, that show she care about the garden.	1	1		1																					
3427	4	The author concludes her story with the quote, �When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� because the author  is showing that nature and the plant are valuable to her. Saeng (who says the quote) believes that the hibiscus will help her pass the test. Earlier on in the story it shows that when she gets in trouble, she rubs the plant leaves in her hands to help her overcome the problem. The author is making the idea clear and portraying the idea that the plant helps Saeng with obstacles.	1	2		2																					
3428	4	In the end of the story the girl Saeng vowes to herself that she will take the drivers test next year.One reason she @MONTH1 have vowed to herself to do that she would do that is to prove that she can pass the test. Also the flower after she bought it and planted it, and after she remembered all the good times she had in Vietnam it gave her the confidense to go out and get what she wanted.	1	2		2																					
3432	4	In my opinion the author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng was feeling down about not passing her driving test but when she saw those flowers she realize when she came to @CAPS1 she  forget all about her home town. So she decied to get back in touch with a nature side and hold off taking her test intill the spring instead of rushing things.	1	1		1																					
3449	4	 The author of �Winter Hibiscus� decided to conclude the story in that way because she wanted to tie in the theme of new beginnings. Saeng is new to @LOCATION1 and has had a rough time fitting in. She misses everything about her old home, from her grandmother to the old plants there. Saeng fails her driving test, so she feels that all is lost. But the hibiscus plant helped her realize she has another chance. The hibiscus can survive the winter and bloom in the spring and that is what Saeng realizes she must do. The last paragraph said �In the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and the hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.� Spring is the time for new beginnings: the geese return from the south, the flowers start to bloom, and Saeng can retake the driving test. In the last paragraph, Saeng realizes she wants a new beginning as well to be brought I the spring. In conclusion, the last paragraph ties the theme of new beginnings into the story. It shows @CAPS1 new realization and how the hibiscus inspired it. 	3	2		3																					
3451	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph for several reasons. First, when the hibiscus buds in the spring that means that the plant is about to bloom. That also means that Saeng will be ready in the spring to take the test again. Also the last paragraph is at the end because if the plant can make it, then the girl can pass her drivers test and be happy both ways.	1	1		1																					
3460	4	The author concludes the story with this paragraph because Saeng will return to the flowers again in the spring.	0	0		0																					
3463	4	I believe the author concludes the story with this paragraph, because the author wants to express to the reader that Saeng has been comforted by the hibiscus and is willing to give the test another try. She is now more open �minded about the situation. In the beginning of the story, Saeng was upset and annoyed about failing her driver�s test. For example, �the tearstains on her daughter�s cheeks and her puffy eyes. I-I failed the test,� Saeng said to her mother. Obviously she was upset and disappointed in herself. The author didn�t want to end the story with a sad, unsatisfying ending. Saeng changes her attitude about the test by the end of the story. For example, �when they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snow melts and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again.� I believe that this attitude was because of the memorys of her mother country that soothes her and also her mother. In conclusion the author ended the story with that to teach the reader a lesson to let change occur and time does heal.	2	3		3																					
3464	4	"The author of the story �Winter Hibiscus"" concludes the story with the motivational paragraph  because he/she wants to show the reeder that  Saeng is determined to adapt to her new life and home and overcome common  obstacles like a driver's test. Saeng had a hard time coping with her problem so she bought a hibiscus because it reminded her of home. I think that the line �and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take the test again."" from the last paragraph is a symbol for growing up and overcoming obstacles. The conclusion for the story is a nice ending."	2	2		2																					
3470	4	Since it is getting close to winter the geese are going south. The plants are losing there leaves. Saeng says that she will take the test again. It seems that when the geese return and the hibiscus buds it will give her hope and confidence. Especially the hibiscus because it reminds her of her homeland and her grandmother, when she first saw it and held the leaf it brought a tear to her eye. And when it comes back next year it will rejuvinate her.	2	2		2																					
3472	4	The author concludes her story with that last paragraph because it shows the relasonship between saeng and the habiscas, and how much just seeing it feels. It also shows that the habiscus  motivates her because it reminds her of her home land that she loves so much and that its like have a pysical memorie of her home land	1	1		1																					
3473	4	The author is relating to that when the geese are ready, they will come back, when the flower is ready it will begin bud and grow. When she is ready she will take the test, is what is being said. She is explaining that she needs time just as the geese and flowers do as well. So you can compare saeng to both the geese and hibiscus, because they too need time in a way for when they are ready to do what they do. In a way saeng has molded as one with both objects.	1	2		2																					
3488	4	She ends it with that statement to show that she is ready to relive spring in the new country now that she is comforted by the hibiscus. The test is adapting to the new country and she failed it she believes because she had to be comforted by her native plants, but she believes that she will pass the test next year because every repetition of the season allow her to become  more adapted to the new culture. When she says ��when the snow melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding then I will take that test again.��All those things tell her it�s a new year and makes it easier to accept what�s happening.        	2	2		2																					
3490	4	The author ended the story with that paragraph to let the readers know that she did not give up. In the story it seem like she had thoughts of giving up but her thoughts of her homeland comforted her when she thoughts she was going to give up. But the last paragraph of the story she confirmed that she wasn�t giving up.	1	1		1																					
3494	4	The author uses this conclusion for a reason. The reason the author uses this cliff-hanges of a conclusion is to keep the reader interested and wanting more. By saying,�I will take that test again,� the author makes the reader question if Saeng will pass the test next time and the reader will wonder what �the test� is.	1	1		1																					
3507	5	The mood in the memoir that the author creates is a very warm and relaxed sort of mood. The way the author tells you about his parents; the selflessness and the way they put their kids first before themselves really just makes you think about your own parents and how good they are to you and what they would do for you. The way the author talks about his home makes you think of all the colors in the house. I think that the house would be a golden � red color yellow, white, brown and orange on the insides. It reminds me of the way they would have cooked. They would have cooked with colorful peppers, onions, tortillas and oils. It makes you think about what colors you have in your home and what you would cook with.  The music sounds wonderful. Even though they don't demonstrate what it actually sounds like, you can easily imagine it. I imagine it laying in the background while all the adults are cooking and the kids are playing in colorful rooms with the golden sunlight shining in through an open window. I love the mood that this memoir puts me in.	1	1		1																					
3511	5	 The mood created by the author in this memoir was very loving and caring for their friends, family and everyone around them, for example it says how his mom would always keep the door open for whoever was going through a rough time or untill they were back on their feet because she knew they would do the same for her and her family. Also the mood is very thankful since Narciso admires everything that he's done in life and who he's helped out and he's thankful for all the friends he has and the care they have for him and his family and he thanks every oppertunity he gets in life. The mood also shows how that somthing small can turn out to be big on the inside because Narciso has done so much just from the small place he lives in.	2	2		2

One way that this mood was @CAPS1 was that they talked how their enviorment Showed a great sense of family and when I think of family I see the mood as comforting and happy. ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"". This showed the mood because his family always took in people and made them feel welcomed @CAPS2 reason the mood was comforting and happy was that it talked about how all of the people were nice and kind to everyone they met. ""It was a close nit community of honest hardworking immigrants who extend a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were Clearly in need"". This is how the memoir showed a happy and comforting mood."	3	3		3																					
3700	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that it is lave. An example from the text says ""My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families friends, and careers in the country they loved ."" @CAPS1 example from the text says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I've often told them my admiration for the strength and perseverance, and I've thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" In conclusion because of his parents love for him they sacrificed alot, so he could have a happy and good life. "	3	3		3																					
3706	5	"The mood Created by the @CAPS2 in the memoir was happy. First thing @CAPS1 the mood is happy Of this memoir is when the @CAPS2 wrote ""Passionate Cuban music (which I dore to this day)"" that meant that @CAPS3 really love her Culture music. Another thing is when @CAPS3 said ""Growing up in this enviroment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative, And for that true you dont have to be related to someone who really love to say that he/@CAPS3 is @CAPS5 of your family is Just enoght that he/@CAPS3 love and care about you like you for he/@CAPS3. Last thing is when the @CAPS2 said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home, that meant that @CAPS3 will never Forget that her family began so small And then turn big because their family went to their house and they stared their new life in the house."	3	2		3																					
3713	5	The mood the auther has is good. He's very proud of how he lives. The most thing that matters in his life are family. His family cares alot and watch over him no matter what and he is very thankful for all.	1	2		2																					
3716	5	The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The author was explaining what the boy in the memoir was feeling and felt. The boy thought that his parents were really great and he thought that he could never be like them. He was also grateful that he had house and parents like you did. He admired his parents and what they did. He will never forget growing up and living in that house. The purpose of the author was to show you how grateful someone was of what there parents did when they immagrated from Cuba to @LOCATION1.	2	2		2																					
3717	5	"There was a mood created by the author in @CAPS1 memoir. Here are some points to help support this parenthesis identify a new mood, his gratefulness, and his view on things. First, parenthesis identify a new mood. When it goes from sentence to parenthesis the new mood appears then it goes back. Here is my reason why the story, ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with aromas of the kitchen."" @CAPS2, his gratefulness. @CAPS1 is very grateful for how things turned out. Here another reason why from the story. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS3, his view on things. @CAPS1 had very fortunate times in his eyes. Ultamately these were my reasons for the mood that was created by the author parenthesis, gratefulness, and his perspective."	2	3		3																					
3718	5	"The mood of the author in the memoir is very happy. I think it sounds like the child of the greatful family is talking and she is one of the most greatful people I ever read about because she says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house to a home""."	1	1		1																					
3721	5	The @CAPS1 the author created is sentimental, sad but happy at the same time. I think the @CAPS1 is mostly sentimental because the family moves to @LOCATION1 and kind of looks back to good memories that happend in cuba.	0	1		1																					
3724	5	"The mood created by the memoir is shown by many things. Through positive words, often mentioned thankfulness, and a cosy setting, a happy positive mood is shown. Positive words are oftem mentioned in the article for example it @CAPS1 ""It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people,"" in this the words honest, hardworking, and the pease ""extended a hand,"" (which means offered help) all invoke a happy mood. The authors constant thanking of things, like as the memoir states ""(and for which I am eternally thankful)"", gives a happy mood because people are only thankful for positive things. Finally this positive mood is shown through setting, which sounds happy and is described as nice. as the memoir @CAPS1 ""within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This descibtion of the setting shows a clear happy cosy, positive mood. The mood created by the memoir is happy, positie, and nice because the memoir is worded with positve words, has often mentioned thankfulness, and has a nice setting."	3	3		3																					
3728	5	"In the memoir the author creates a happy mood. In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez talks about what he enjoyed and is thankful for from his childhood. He does this by talking about how his kitchen table was surronded by his ""family"". Or as he say ""countloss extended family members cane and went."" This shows that there were always people around. He also says how he is thankful for how his parents came to the @LOCATION1 ""to give their children a better life"".

3735	5	"What is the mood of the memoir? The mood is elated. One reason is because ""My parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This seems very happy to me because moving from your country can be hard. So his parents brought some of cuba with them. That is the reason the mood is elated."	1	1		1																					
3738	5	"In this memoir the author creats a mood of grattitude. To support a claim like this I will provide evidence. It says in the article that ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. This clearly shows how the author is trying to creat a mood of gratitude. His gratitude is being showed towards his parents. Also it says that They came selflessly as many immigrants do to give there children a better life. This shows how the family leaves there comfort to a troublesome life for there children, thus making the children very greatful. The mood created by the author is gratefullness and is shown throw out the whole memoir."	2	2		2																					
3746	5	"In this excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is a sad story. The mood the author is putting sad and happy stories at the same time. One example is when his parents left from Cuba for his son's own sake for a better place. His parents had great jobs in Cuba. His mother was a Chemical @ORGANIZATION1. and his father worked in a labratory. ""In Cuba @PERSON2,had worked in a laboratory and @LOCATION1 had studied chemical engineering."" The author's mood of this story is sad."	2	1		2																					
3752	5	"In the excerpt ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: the Blueprints of Our Lives. Narciso Rodriguez create a feeling of mood about their home life. Narciso talk about life at home and about his parents cooking. He is greatful for his parents cooking and how he learned from them. In paragraph three it states ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" This shows that he considered people around him family and not just his blood relatives. He shows this by talking about how his surrogate grandparents lived in the basement and he didn't know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba. He is always grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. The whole memoir is about love, family which sets a positive mood for the reader."	3	3		3																					
3753	5	The mood in the memoir is very calm. It's not very tense and depressing. An example of it being calm is in paragraph @NUM1 when the words are in the parentheses it's like the person is talking to you. Also how it Just states facts and a @CAPS1. Another example of it being calm is how the @CAPS1 is happy and not sad. It has a flow to it.	1	1		1																					
3755	5	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very touching. the memoir explains how as a kid he didnt have much growing upas a kid but he did have family and he was extreamly greatful and proud of his parents for their efforts to start a new family in a different country without knowing the languge. When I hear about someone being that @CAPS1 it makes me think how times have changed from whe Narciso was growing up in the @NUM1's. He was so greatful and happy when compaired to now he has nothing. But he was abel to show all his gratude with the deepest heart warming simpathyall in all @CAPS2 learned from his parents and knew that family was the most important thing you can have.	2	2		2																					
3759	5	"The mood  in the memoir could be many things the one that really stands out to me though is grateful. One way how @CAPS1 shows this is @CAPS1 says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice @CAPS1 is so thankful that her parents brought her to @LOCATION1 so @CAPS1 could live a wonderful life.Another way @CAPS1 shows @CAPS1 is grateful is @CAPS1 says ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 respects what her gone through to make her life enjoyable and not like what her parents lives were.The last way @CAPS1 shows gratefulness is @CAPS1 thanks her parents every day for what they have done. ""I've thanked them repeatedly"" @CAPS1 says in paragraph @NUM1. I don't think @CAPS1 could ever picture what her life would be like if her parents didn't do that for her. This is what I think the mood is in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
3761	5	"The mood of the memoir is love. @PERSON1 and his family ""... always kept their arms and their door open to the many people (they) consider family, knowing that they would do the ""same for (them)"" (@NUM1). Even though""(thier) nieghorhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States"" (@NUM2) they all cared for each other as if they were one family. Prior to moving to the United States, ""Narciso, Sr., had worked in the laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studed chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start thier lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find"" (@NUM3). They moved to the United States, leaving their good jobs, so that thier son could live a better life Narciso doesnt take this for granted. He engulfs the in a profusion of thanks. Throughout the memoir the author costantly writes about all the caring and love in the lives of @PERSON1 and his family."	3	3		3																					
3763	5	"The mood in the memoir given by the author makes me think of my home. Overall, it makes you feel warm or happy inside. In the second paragraph when he is explaining his house and the music playing it automatically makes me think of my house around the holidays; like when the music is playing and you sing along matter how bad you are. You can tell that this book gives the reader a very positive mood or good ""vibe""."	1	1		1																					
3764	5	"The mood in this memior is Warmth and comforting.Narcis talks about how is family is still rich in cuture and open to anyone who needs a family.in paragraph @NUM1 Narciso decribles his ""family"" that lives/visits often.Clearly, their home is open with a warm heart."	1	1		1																					
3766	5	"The mood of the @CAPS1 in the memoir is happy and grateful a quote for being grateful is is paragraph @NUM1. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice""."	2	1		2																					
3768	5	"The mood described in this memoir is mostly about love, unity, and culture. In love he shows that his parents immigrated mostly to give his children a better future. This is described in paragraph @NUM1.In unity it shows that in their neighborhood most of the immigrants were always having feasts and being really close to each other. This is explained in paragraph @NUM2 where it says, ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship."". His parents taught him how to cook food from his country and also to dance to Cuban Music as it says in paragraph @NUM3. These are the types of mood described in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
3772	5	The mood created by the author is touching. I think that the mood is touching because Narciso Rodriguez is talking about how his neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, & Italian immigrants at a time when racism was the norm & segregation prevailed in the United States. Also b/c he had to share a house with alot of people, his parents struggled both personally and financially & his parents couldn't find a jobs. That's why I think the mood is touching.	1	2		2																					
3782	5	"The author creates a mood that he is very greatful to his parents. His parents taught him how to cook in a Cuban-style, (wich he loves to cook). ""(and for wich I am eternally greatful)."" His main greatfullness, is of their love and sacrifise. They would take in someone who needed time to get back on their feet, wich he found amazing. ""I will allways be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" And he is not affraid to let them know, ""I've often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance and I've thanked them repetedly."" @CAPS1 the memoir, the auther creates a mood that he is greatful to all his parents love and sacrifices, not only to himself, but to everyone they've helped."	3	2		3																					
3786	5	The author creates a loving, and caring mood. He makes it feel that you too could be invited into their home with open arms. That if you are feeling down they would pick you right up with a warm meal and a cozzy bead. He describes that they left Cuba to come to the land of oppertunities. That this family is filled with the most important thing needed to survive, @CAPS1.	2	1		2																					
3790	5	"The mood created in the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez is very happy. The mood is happy because all you read are good things @CAPS1 put you in a good. one example is ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that ""family"" had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" @CAPS1 means to me that any one can be your family."	1	1		1																					
3792	5	"The author's mood was wondering and near the end, it changed you happiness. I thought the mood was wondering at first because he was wondering what ""home"" was all about. Then, it was changed to happiness because now the author knew what ""home"" is all about."	1	1		1																					
3800	5	In the memoir the mood created by the author is the mood of happiness and appritiation. This has the mood of happiness because it just fills you with happiness to know the everyone can be one big family no matter what race and having realized that anyone can be family even if their not a blood relative. This memoir gives you the feeling of appritiation because it makes you appritiate what you have and appritiate having any kind of family. Also just to have everyone united as one and be thankful for my culture and it kind of makes me want to explore my culture and express it more.	1	2		2																					
3806	5	"The mood in this memoir I believe  is appreciation and caring towards others. @NUM1 home as well as neighborhood was a place of unity and caring for one another like a family. In the memoir it says that people were always coming in and out of the house for a place to stay or for a meal to eat and were always welcomed with open arms. ""Family""  to him didn't mean you were related but were loved and cared for by other and with that mindset he had a huge family. His parent left behind their lives in Cuba where they were both scientists and had friends and family there for their son. They knew that the United States had better oppurtunitis for Narciso (in which he becomes a designer). He states several times how grateful he is of his parents for them to move to the @LOCATION3 for him as well as making his house feel like a home."	3	3		3																					
3808	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from Home: The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of our Lives the overall mood of the author is greatfulness. Narciso begins the memoir by telling us how much @CAPS3 appreciates his culture and all that his parents do for him In paragraph @NUM1, ""... And unwittenly passed on to me the rich culinary skills and love of cooking... (For which I am eternally greatful)"" @CAPS3 has an optemistic outlook on every aspect of his family and his culture. Most of it had to do with how @CAPS3 grew up and was born into a family who had just finished their hardships of getting int @LOCATION1."	2	2		2																					
3815	5	The mood of the storry is happy. She discribes how lucky she is to have parents like her own, and be Cuban. She loves the music, the food, and the culture. She's glad her parent were careing and helped people.	1	2		2																					
3816	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was happy and up lifting. The author discussed the positives in his life. He did not dwell on the negatives, did not say what he would like to change. The positive mood of the memoir made it entertaining to read.The author emphasized the fact that his parents moved to @LOCATION1 because it was best for their children. They would sacrafice having the jobs that they deserved. They immigrated to @LOCATION1 to give their children a better life. His parents cared about the future of their kids, and they were unselfish.The way in which the author honors his parents makes the story very enjoyable. The mood is positive and keeps the reader interested and involved. It was a very good story.	2	2		2																					
3817	5	"The mood created in this story was happiness and greatfulness towards his parents. In the story he told the many sacrifices his parents made to give him a better life than the one they had. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" ""But in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for their spirit of generosity."" His parents came to the country knowing little engish and having to start their lives over just so that his life would be better."	2	2		2																					
3819	5	The author creates a special mood in this memoir. The mood the author gives is a very comfortable mood. He talks about his family and how they all ate together and always had relatives stoping by. It gives you a sense of togetherness. It gives you a sense of how the family interacted and became one with the neighborhood. So the author of this article really shows how just the whole town had a sense of togetherness with the family.	2	2		2																					
3820	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" I believe he goes from a calm mood to a proud mood. He starts off describing his life so far and family. How he used to live in a one-room apartment in Cuba and how his family lives in Newark, New Jersey along with other Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immagrints. Then he talks about the neighborhood and how together are great solidarity and friendships. Also, a honest and hard working community mostly immagrints. He also said, ""I will always be grateful to my for their love and sacrifice."" (paragraph @NUM1) I think Narciso feel thankful and proud to be a Cuban and have such wonderful parents. ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (last sentence)"	2	3		3																					
3825	5	"The mood created by the author is welcoming. ""In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the iron bound section of Newark, New Jersey."" This gives the feeling of being welcomed because it makes me feel like we just saw Narciso Rodriguez's house and we are about to walk in. ""In our neighborhood, despite custums elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solitary and friendship."" This makes me feel welcome because it doesn't matter if you are different you are still family. ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen."" This gives me the feeling of being welcomed because it was imagery that makes me imagine and I'm able to picture this house, with brilliant smells and lovely cuban music playing. In conclusion, the mood of being welcomed is portrayed strongly throughout the memoir, especially when he is describing his home"	3	3		3																					
3830	5	The mood described by the author is homely. In the excerpt the author invites you into his own house, his own life. that creates a nice mood, descr ibing how everyone got along and that everyone .is. family.	1	1		1																					
3834	5	The mood in the memoir is basicly showing love, happiness, and friendship. The way that the mood shows love is in @CAPS1 @NUM1 and @NUM2. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 is says Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. In @CAPS1 @NUM2 it talks about how his parent welcome refugees to celebrate their arrival to @LOCATION1. Happiness was shown throughout the story. And friendship was shown as well The way that friendship was shown by his parents keeping their door open to whom who did not have a home. But let them stay in their home until their back on he or she is back on there feet, and considerd part of the family.	2	2		2																					
3840	5	the @CAPS1 mood was good he have spicecfic details and told were he was from how his parents were ect.	1	1		1																					
3841	5	The mood the author creates is the sadness of living one country where freinds and family lived. To happiness of the times they've shared in the United States. As the memoir states the center of the home was the kitchen where here parents split cooking duties and where passionate Cuban music filled the air the the kitchen's aroma. In the kitchen was the backdrop to life in their home. The author also creates a mood that is filled with their hope of creating a better life for the family even if it meant leaving their country, freinds, and family behind. The author also creates a mood of love and caring which her parents showed for her and her sister. These are the moods the author creates throughout the memoir.	2	3		3																					
3845	5	"In the memoir, the author creates a very peaceful mood. He achieves this by using a blunt voice and unusual punctuation.The author's voice is very blunt. for example, he describes his house as a ""simple house"" numerous times in the memoir. He tells the reader more than enough about his simple home, and there is almost no conflict in this memoir. This gives the reader a sense of peace and never leaves the reader hanging or wondering about something.To help him with that, the author uses lots of unusual punctuation. Parenthesis are used five times in this writing, as well as five words with dashes. This punctuation is used to give extra information, like the age of ""twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria"" or about ""Passionate Cuban music (Which I adore to this day)."" When the author gives extra information, it gives the reader a sense of peace and makes him feel ""at home"", which is the topic of the memoir."	3	2		3																					
3846	5	The mood that is described in this story is love. Why did I pick love? I picked love because in the story it says a lot of stuff about family and Cuba and home (Cuba, is where the love (family) is. In this story is states that his love comes from his family and love comes from every family and @PERSON1's loves his family he says it alot in the story.	1	1		1																					
3849	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a verry happy tone. The reasons that its a happy tone is because @CAPS1 tells about her Childhood hapily by talking about the unity of his invirorment and the happiiness, cuban food, and Cuban music that filled his home and that still fills his home today because he injoyes it so much.	2	1		2																					
3853	5	"In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our loves the author creates a mood in the memoir. The mood that he creates is a relaxed and laid-back mood.The way the author writes is very smooth for example ""in 1961 I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey."" That is a very relaxed sentence.He then goes on about his life. He tells about his neighborhood, family, religion and much more. Towards the end he tells what he is grateful for.The author told this story as if he was being interviewed and he was very relaxed and layed back."	1	1		1

3859	5	"The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez in the memoir is very thankfull and happy. Narciso does a very good job of show his moods, like when he says, ""Growing up in this environment it instilled me a great sense that 'family' had nothing to do with being blood relative."" Here, you can tell that the mood is happy because the way he says how his family would welcome anyone into their family, but It also shows that if you grow up in a good family environment, you're also going to want to invest those lessons into your own kids lifes. Another example of mood is the last sentence, ""I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home."" Not only does it show again that what you learn when you are little you always want for your family, but also shows that you cannot call a house a home till you are able to live their with your family and the home always have a good mood in it. In the end, the mood in this memoir by Narciso Rodriguez, reflects the proper, but not only way, to have a good mood in your home."	3	3		3

Also there are certain words in the passage that would help with the mood, words such as selflessly, solidary, love, friendship, and sacrifice. In my opinion, this words help bring the mood to a happy, calming feeling to the passage. The ""happy"" mood is created by the authoR in this memoiR."	2	2		2

It is also lifting because Narciso's parents gave up everything and everyone so that their family can live a better life. Another reason why it is lifting is because in the story it talks about how the family doesn't have to neccisarily blood related and can be someone you love and will help you. That is why I think the mood created by the author in the memoir is lifting.	2	2		2

It wasn't a happy or sad in was a flat mood, because Its talking about how their in debt needed to move the kid lost all of his friends. The kid can't attend school because they can't afford any type of education. so that is why its a basic or flat mood. I also belive its a basic mood because it says that ""kids have to do a lot of the work"" because They are the youngest and the older can't do that work or they will get hurt. Towards the end It gets to a happy mood because it say ""my parents will always be there for me."""	2	1		1

And in his eyes, his whole community was one big family. His parents were kind, giving and generous to everyone. Despite the different customs elsewhere, all of these cultures were united as one family. They would lend a hand for anyone who needed it, because they know that they'd do the same for them. Throughout his life, he'd never forget his wonderful childhood and all the things he was taught, @CAPS1 and Generosity.	2	2		2

3945	5	"The mood created by the author is @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and relaxing. I think that because all he's talking about is his family and how much his parents did for him. For example in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I will never forget how my Parents turned this simple house into a home."" To me that sounds like @CAPS2 because he knows he can always come home to his Parents if he ever need help. Another example is in @CAPS3 @NUM1 it says ""I learned there about how to love"". That to me sounds like when he was growing up it was rough and he never actually loved some one in his life until now."	1	3		2																					
3948	5	"The mood of this memoir was appreciative. The author reflects upon his experiences at home in a positive manner which expresses the fact that he is thankful for what he had.

This quote shows Narciso's appreciation for the culinary skills his parents passed down to him. The extra information in the parentheses also provide a grateful tone to the piece of writing. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" The language used (grateful) shows the intence thankfulness he feels. Throughout the entire reading the word ""grateful"" is used repeadtly. The use of repetition provides a reader with the knowledge that that word is very important. So grateful appears to be a keyword. Also, later in paragraph @NUM2 it says ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed on me at such a young age"" There is so much passion in this phrase. ""There is no way to express my gratitude"" shows that he's just so thankful there is not way to even express it.

3970	5	The mood the author created in memoir was that of happiness and acception. Even though Narciso Rodriguez is Cuban, as well as his family, he fit into his neighborhood, and most likely made a lot of friends very quickly. This gave a feeling of acception as well as a lot of happiness. That is the mood that the auther set on the story.	1	1		1

They were all friends and had a good bond. He had people at his house for dinners. It was here in the United States, that he really understood what family was or what a home was. He couldn't show his parents how grateful he was for them to go through such a hard time to make their childrens lives better. The thankful mood he displays makes the story more meaningful.	2	2		2																					
4077	5	The mood created by the story could be described as thanfullness or gratitude. After reading about a loving pair of parents that gave everything they had just for their children makes you feel guilty and respectful of your own parents. The author portrayed that they were grateful for their parents and they he or she knew they would never be able to repay them. From what the author says, times at home financially @MONTH1 have been tough, but because they had such a loving family, everything was alright. It makes me happy and proud to think that my family plays a huge part in who I am. The mood that is created by this story is admiration.	2	2		2																					
4080	5	"The mood of the memoir created by the author was that he was very greatful for what his family has done. I know this because throughout the memoir he would always say how much he appreciated how his parents made this house into a Cuban home. I also know that the mood of the memoir by the author is greatful because he said how he liked that his neighborhood had many different cultures such as Spanish and Italian. The author also said ""I will never forget how my parents turn this simple house into a home."" That is what I think the mood of this memoir is."	2	3		3																					
4082	5	"In this memoir about Narciso Rodriguez the ton is happy and loving. In this memoir there are many examples about how the tone is loving, and happy, but heres a few. First in paragraph @NUM1 there + two phrases in parenthesees that show how @CAPS1 loved the things like the music and the cooking of his home, and family. ""(and for which I am eternally greatful)."" And, ""(which I adore to this day)."" @CAPS1 wouldn't have added the use things in unless @CAPS1 truly meant it, and if @CAPS1 really loved his home. Also what sets the tone is how @CAPS1 talks about loving his parents, and how @CAPS1 is grateful for them. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice,"" @CAPS1 states in the first sentence of paragraph @NUM2. Lastly, the last sentence of the memoir is happy and puts a smile on your face after you read it, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" In Rodriguez's memoir, it has a happy and loving tone throughout it."	2	3		3																					
4085	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author sets a certain mood. I think the mood created in this story is love. My reason for thinking this is that the story talks about how the parents sacrificed everything to move to the @LOCATION1 so they would have a better life and so would their children. Another reason why love is the mood is because he talks about how even though the people he spent his time with weren't his blood relatives, he still consider them all family. Lastly, I think love is the theme because he shows an undying gratitude towards his parents for his wonderful childhood and making the place he lived in feel like home. That is why I think the mood the memoir creates is love"	3	2		3																					
4090	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is happiness and love I think that this memoir is about happiness because in paragraph @NUM1 he explains how fun and happy his home is. And his family cooks together which he really appreciates and @CAPS1. I also think this memoirs about love to because through out the whole memoir he talks about his appeciation and love for his family and friends. And thats why I think the mood of this memoir is happiness and love.	2	2		2																					
4092	5	"The mood in the memoir is happyness, and friendship, and glory, an example is ""My parents always always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us. A feeling of friendship and honesty is ""it was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, where clearly in need."" and that is the mood of the memoir."	1	2		2																					
4101	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" the mood created by the author is very loving and grateful. He talks about how great it was growing up in his home. He also says how gracious his parents were. In the memoir he said, ""I will always be grate ful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could ever have done."" This shows that he sounds very grate ful to his parents for everything that they have done. The mood also sounds very loving because he loves his parents for moving to @LOCATION1. His parents also sound loving to him because they were brave and sacrificed a lot for him. these things are why the mood of the memoir is loving and grateful."	3	3		3																					
4102	5	"The mood of the boy in this story was he was happy talking about how his whole family could come to his house for any meal in the day. Also his friends could come over too. While he was explainng how he didn't ever get to meet his real grandparents from Cuba he didn't sound as happy as before the text was more happy. At the end of this memoir the boy said "" I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" When he said that his mood went to happy and thankful for everything his parents gave him in his life also like the main thing is  his cooking skills came from his parents too @CAPS1 he is very thankful for what he has. That is the boys mood in the story."	2	3		3																					
4114	5	The mood from the auther her Life was very good @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in a simlpe house cuba. @CAPS1 Do alot of fun thing with her family. her grateful parents their Love sacrifice and I've often @CAPS1 Told then that what did was so much courageous and her parents told her that the early age the demonstarat how important family and friend are.	2	1		1																					
4117	5	"I think the mood of the memoir is overall positive. The charactor is always complimenting his parents and is always telling him he admires ""their strength and perseverance."" @CAPS1 of the memoir is the child complimenting the parents and culitur. Narciso strongly adores him family."	1	1		1																					
4125	5	"In the memoir, the mood created by the author is very understandable and true. Throughout the memoir the author says how grateful he is for his parents. In the memoir Narciso explains, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso's parents had to go through a lot of hard things. They had to leave their country, their friends and family, and they had to pretty much start their lives over again. But his parents stood strong in those hard times. They cared and taught Narciso many important things. The mood the author sets is very loving. The author had very incredible parents that he is very grateful for."	2	2		2																					
4127	5	"In the memoir, the author doesn't just describe the journey to @LOCATION1 and the house he lived in. He gives a in depth and warm description of his life in @LOCATION1 and the relationships he made. He also spends some time talking about the selflessness of his parents and what they do to make the new immigrants feel welcome in this new place.The author sets the mood that makes people wanna read this if they are feeling sad and they just want to get a warm, cozy feeling from it. I think the mood in this gives off a sence of being selfless, but also coming together when all are segregated and form unity. When you turn segregation into unity then good things are bound to happen. The authors says this in his memoir: ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" The mood of this story really shows you that the world doesn't have to be a cold, heartless place.If we do as they do, we can all live in unity."	3	2		2																					
4131	5	"In Narciso Rodriguez's memoir, the author created a very thankful mood. When Narciso talks about his family's culture at home, he constantly tells us how much he sill loves it today. ""Passionate Cuban music (which I adored to this day) filled the air..."" (@CAPS1. @NUM1). Instead of just telling us that there was passionate Cuban music in his home as a child, he included the parenthasese to remind us that he still loves the music he used to listen to. This makes him sound very thankful that his parents played that music in his home. In addition to him giving us reasons to believe he is thankful, he tells us in his memoir that he constantly thanks his parents. ""I've thanked them repeatedly."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2). He tells us plainly that he thanks his parents, and that he is very thankful for what they did for him when he was a child. Finally, ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" (@CAPS1. @NUM2) ends his memoir and proves to us how thankful he is. Only a person who is very thankful ""will never forget..."" something. Throughout Narciso's memoir, there is a very clear and constant mood of thankfullness."	3	3		3

In paragraph @NUM2, he also says he will always be greatful to his @CAPS1. Leaving your freinds and families behind is a brave action.He also creates a sad mood when he says that all imigrants come selflessly to this country to give their children a better life.

4139	5	"The mood in this selection is prode and happy. I know this from some clues in the text. the first and biggest clue is when the auther states some facts like ""and for wich I am eternaly ""greatful"" and ""witch I adore to this day. Also when she says that ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"" it shows how prouud she is."	2	2		2

4150	5	"Living life in a country or place away can be very difficult from what I've known, heard and seen. Poverty often takes over the situation with a side of racism and discrimination occasionally. Nonetheless, this well-told memoir tells of the contentment and good side of it all. The happiness that was created in a place that Narciso calls home. In the home, he still got to experience Cuban culture including music, traditional cooking and best of all ambiance of family being around. ""Here the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home."" This quote kind of lightens up the whole idea of this memoir and how people from all over came together to celebrate the wonderful joys of life even though at times they were frowned upon."	2	2		2																					
4151	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is love. Narciso and his family had so much love that they were able to overcome struggles and help others to overcome by allowing them to stay in their home, and live with them. They allowed people who weren't even apart of their family to become part of their family, they loved and cared for other, possiably even more than them selves and gave up everything they had in cuba to come to america for a better future for their children. The amount of love in this house is what turned it form an ordiary house and into a loving, caring, compassionate, and selfless home, not only for Narciso but for everyone in the community, and family"" that was created. That is what the mood of this memoir was, and in whom created it."	2	3		3																					
4167	5	"The mood that is created by the author is joy. The reason I think that is because Narciso's parent's are immigrants who works hard. They could've stayed in their own country but they wanted a better future for Narciso. When Narciso realized that he felt happy and filled with joy. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents."" When you're grateful you feel happyness. This is the mood that I think this author created."	2	2		2

Narcisos family is nice to everyone and everyone in their neighborhood is nice to them. He explains his parents doings.

For example, in paragraph @NUM1 where it states, ""was a close-knit community of honest, hard working immigrants who extended a hand to people, not nessecarly of their own kind, were clearly in need"". This line showed me how much love there must've been. Also, that everyone cared about everyone else. When the author is showing how her parents left their country to come to @LOCATION1, you can tell how grateful the author is this is shown extremely clear in paragraph @NUM2 where it states ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice.I think this story made me realize that you need to apperciate what others do for you.

All though ""they struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" they had to do what they thought was best for their children. Their simple house was the best place for them to be together as a family. ""The warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love"". This memoir made me connect this family to mines how similar it is.

4240	5	"The mood is a mixture of things, it's really hard to say withe all the emotions the author throws around. But however the strongest feeling is unity, and family.I'm Not sure family can be called an emotion, but it is I think something that can be described by several. One of course is unity, or as he says it, ""great solidarity and friendship""it's rather sweet how he charectorizes family as something as the bonds you make withe people in contrast to other cultures where family is from blood ties and family s always first. So in a way I think his way of thinking comes from his culture.But also he puts in a bit of sadness but overall seems to be extremely thankful for what he has. As they say ""happiness is nothing without appreciating it"" and as he says ""I learned the real defnetion of family"" so apparently he knows real happiness"	3	2		3

He talks about how they created their New Jersey home into a traditional Cuban home. For example he says that the kitchen is the heart of his home and how his parents taught him how to cook, which he is greatful for. Lastly his mood towards his friends is that he treats them and considers them as his family. For example his landlord's daughter cooked meals for him more often than not. Also his ""real"" grandparents wich weren't his real grandparents because they were still in cuba. Those are the reasons that create the authors mood in the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4297	5	"The author's mood of this memoir is extremely thankful and appeciative. He said he will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifices, and mentions what struggles they had, beginning in a one room apartment then affording to move into a three room apartment for him to call home. He explains how his parents started their lives entirely over in @LOCATION1, and needed to take whatever work they could find. They were able to endure their hard times with the faith that this struggle would help lead themselves and their children into better times. The author had so much admiration of his parents strength and perseverance. He learned the true meaning of 'family"" and about how to love. He was really appreciative for all he had, and the lessons of generosity and how important family & friends are that his courageous parents had taught him, that had also become the basis of his life."	3	3		3																					
4298	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the author creates a family mood. Rodriguez talks about how family always visits. The memoir states ""countless extended family members came and went..."" (paragraph @NUM1). He also explains that family isn't always the people related to you. Rodriguez says that his neighborhood ""came together in great solidarity..."" (paragraph @NUM1). Rodriguez says that he is most grateful for his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Narciso Rodriguez really creates a mood filled with love, caring, and family."	3	3		3																					
4304	5	I think in my opion is that the author was very comfortable with his words and his way of being human. His parents was originally from cuba, @CAPS1 was in to there culture nice to other in there surrounding. For an example @CAPS2 say It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to the country and where I celebrated His first birthday.	1	1		1																					
4307	5	"The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in the story is happy This is because he got to move to the @LOCATION1 and be born hear for a better life. He Also loved growing up hear with the cuban traditions and music as stated on paragraph @NUM1 ""And for what I am eternally grateful,"" wich I adore to this day."""	1	2		2																					
4308	5	In this memoir, Narciso made the mood peaceful because he named the music that was playing and all the family that ate with them. Narciso also talked about them cooking. I think the moods peaceful because he doesn't say anything bad about his parents. he only says the good things about them. The mood could also be grateful because he was grateful for many things that his parents did for him such as pass down the love of culinary. He's also grateful for his parents leaving Cuba and @CAPS1 everything over again @CAPS2 that he could have a good job and a good life. Another possible mood can be warmth because Narciso loved his family and probably felt the warmth of everyone when they all went over his house.	2	1		2																					
4310	5	Narciso @PERSON1 so proud he was Cuban immigrante and how his parent did so much for him. he realized that (in paragraphy @NUM1) family had nothing to do with being blood relative. And How all culture just came together as great solidarity and friendship doubt to when overt racism was norm and segregation prevailed in United @ORGANIZATION1. He learned the true meaning of family. How his parent turn a regluar house into home that he loved. He was grateful how his parent made so many sacrifice that turn something into life time expenence that he will never forget. He was happy how little thing turn it great memories, that he can't wait to tell the world.	2	3		3																					
4311	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir was greatful. The memoir was all about how Narciso Rodriguez admired his parents courage, selfishness, culture, heritage, strength, and perseverance.  Narciso said, ""I will always be greatful to my parents for their love and sacrifice"" @CAPS1 also said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are."" Not once did the authors say anything negative about his experiences growing up. The memoir focused on how @CAPS1 is so greatful for everything his parents did and sacrificed for him. In conclusion, the mood created by the author of the memoir was happy and greatful."	2	3		3																					
4313	5	"The mood created by the auther in the memoir are love, happyness, and @CAPS1. Love is one of the moods because they welcome people in need ""My parents always Kept their arms and their door open to the many people we consider family, Knowing they would do the same for us. Happieness is one of the mood because Narciso is pleased with parents. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and secrifice."".  @CAPS1 is one of the moods because all every one in the neighbor hood got along. ""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these culture came together in great solidarity and friendship.""."	3	3		3																					
4314	5	The mood created by the memoir is exciting because he likes fashion design. He makes the story about clothing design. He also feels happy because he likes the home and has turned a simple house into home. He felt sad because he was born in a simple house. He wanted somewhere he could call home.	1	1		1																					
4325	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir was warm and inviting. The auther made it feel as. if I was really there in his neighbrhood. the auther took the things most people take for grantit and elaberated on them. he made the mood feel real he made the reader that they were a part of the story.	1	1		1																					
4326	5	"the @CAPS1 the author created was a warming @CAPS1. He gave events from the past which created a content tone. He also used discriptive language about the food, Music, and family. in this memoir it stated that he appricieated his parents very much for their selflessness. in @NUM1 it sais ""Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing to do with being a blood @CAPS2"". This is showing now nis family treated him real well. All in All he gave a good tone in this story."	1	1		1																					
4329	5	Though out this story there is a certain @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. like how these people got there dream home and this was it. How there Parents Came to this country not knowing the language or have a good edication but Still becoming succesful and living in this house. Where these people learned to love. and the best part having family near by.	2	1		2

He also talked about sad moments and happy moments he didnt get to know his real grandparents until 1970 when they were allowed to leave cuba in paragraph @NUM1.	1	1		1																					
4342	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is a happy and a loving one. A reason why I think this is by talking about how he and his neighbors (of different descent) All got along very well in solidarity with one another which creates a sense of love. Also when he talks about happy times like when he and his family are cooking in the kitchen they are having a good time, laughing, and listening to Cuban Music. Lastly when he and his family take in family or even just really close friends who they consider family conveys a true sense of happiness, peace, and love.	2	2		2																					
4343	5	"The @CAPS1 of this memoir creates a mood that is very touching and meaningful. It shows the hardships his family had to overcome as well as the good that came frome it all. The @CAPS1 states in his memoir, that, although his family was going through tough times, they left their door wide open to family that needed help and always had the thought of others in their mind. He explains how hard it was for his parents to leave their home and jobs in cuba, but that they did it for him, so he would get to live a better life. one more thing the @CAPS1 said in the memoir that was very touching was when he said, ""But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me..."" These words show us how much of an impact his parents action had on him and how they helped him in life. These are some examples of how the @CAPS1 describes the mood."	3	3		3

4354	5	"In this memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, there is certain mood. I believe that the mood is supposed to be seen as joyful and uplifting. The whole memoir is describing what a rich child hood the author had, from his home itself to all his family, he had nothing but great things to say. When talking about his home, he says ""Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am externally grateful)."" I would say that is pretty enlightening. He also says how grateful he is for his parents. The mood of this memoir is nothing but good."	3	3		3																					
4365	5	"one mood of this memoir was that of a traditional Cuban home. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM1, ""My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary Skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban Music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" A second mood of this memoir was the impression of a Cuban family who faced my hardships. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM2 ""They Struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships."" The last mood gives me the impression of what a real family is about: love, loyalty and friendship. In the memoir, paragraph @NUM3 ""It was here where I learned the real definition of ""family"". And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."	3	3		3																					
4367	5	"The mood of the @CAPS1 is happy. In the memior, Narciso Rodriguez describes the happy and fun times of living in her small home in New Jersey. He describes how his family, which consisted of her mother and father turned their @CAPS2 house into a cuban home and opened the doors to other refugees that were going through difficult times. In the last @CAPS4 Narciso explains that this is the home where all her first birthdays happened, and where her friends and family would gather. The message the @CAPS1 was trying to get across is that it doesn't matter how big or expensive a home is, it matters who is in the home that makes it a special place to be. The reason I know the @CAPS3 mood was happy is because, she had wonderful people in her life. Her home wasn't big and fancy but as described in @CAPS4 @NUM1 ""It was a simple house that my parents opened to other refugees."" In this @CAPS5 he is saying that his home was full of happiness and love. Narciso's once simple house had turned into a home, filled with friends and family."	3	3		3																					
4370	5	The mood of the memoir is nostalgic and happiness. He tells the readers about his econimic backgrounds. He also explains about his family and what they meant to him. then, he talks about his house and about how he had he had his birthday there. Those are some examples on how they create the mood.	1	2		2

In the memoir, it says, ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" Narciso loves his parents and the way they raised him."	1	2		2																					
4374	5	I think the mood in this storie was mostly happy and grateful. Because he loved living there with his parents and having family members around and being able to learn about his heritage. And learn about all the cooking. He seems to have had a very nice childhood and has always thanked his parents for that. they gave up everything to go to america to raise him and he seens very grateful.	1	2		2																					
4377	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from home: the blueprints of our lives. The mood created by the memoir are described in many ways. To start of with, ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that FAMILY had nothing to do with being a blood relative."" Quite the contrary, his neighborhood was made up mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, @CAPS2 will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrifice. @CAPS2've often told them that they did was a much more courageous thing than @CAPS2 could have ever done. Finally, It was here where @CAPS2 learned the real definition of ""family"". @CAPS2 will never forget his house and his gracious neighborhood and @CAPS2 will never forget how his parent turned this simple house to a home. In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"", from home: the blueprints of our lives. The mood created by the memoir where discribe in these ways."	2	2		2

Here he shows his compassion for his parents because his parents left cuba and went to @LOCATION1 to start a new life. Also, they wanted a better education for their children so they left family, friends, everything behind so they could restart their life. Another way how Narciso shows love to his parent is by using what his parents did to him into his life. Narciso used the better education, to have a better life. Now he is a fashion designer.

And the family was so enthusiastic and happy just because their family was together	1	1		1																					
4440	5	In the memoir the mood created by the author I think was more of a serious, informative, and uplifting mood. The reason for why I think this is that the way his lifestyle is described as a happy and enjoyable life of also being able to talk about some serious topics like his culture and the diversity of the cultures of the poeple that live on the street. Also by how he feels so confortable with all the people that are in his apartment building and all the people that come to his house for dinner to call them family.	2	2		2

Another reason, was that you should always help your family s during bad times.

In conclusion this is how the mood creates the author."	2	4		3																					
4479	5	The author creates many moods in the story. While reading this story I felt happy, sometimes sad and overall it made me feel good.The mood that the author is trying to sel is happieness and unity. even though many cultures and ethnic backgrounds were in his neiborhood they all came together as one. Then at other times I felt sad because he grew up with racism still in america. The story makes me feel good because the author is trying to say that it is not the materialistic things that make you happy it is the family and freinds that surroud you every single day.	2	2		2																					
4480	5	"I believe the was more of a ""thank you"" in the memoir and here a three reasons. I think Narciso Rodriguez is thanking his parents for making him have a good childhood. Like in the excerpt ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home. Another reason I think he's thanking his parents because he was praising them. In the excerpt ""I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" @CAPS1 Narciso is forever grateful to his parents. Like in the excerpt ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" These are the three ways the mood was more of a ""thank you"" kind of thing in the memoir."	2	3		3																					
4481	5	"on paragraph @NUM1 in the article it say's ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done."" I think that the mood the auther is creating in the memoir is happyness because Narciso is very geatful to his parents."	2	1		2																					
4483	5	The mood created by Narciso Rodriguez  in his memoir is thankfulness. Throughout the memoir Rodriguez talks about the life his parents gave him and how thankful he was.	1	1		1																					
4485	5	This passag has a very calm and happy mood. He is looking back on his childhood and the memories. He talked about the cheerful house, people and neighborhood. You could picture the house and smell the aromas. Narciso set a very nice setting and tone that the entire passage was lifted in energy. You could tell he was passionate about what she was writing. He showed a real admiration for his childhood and the people he shared it with. The way he felt about her childhood was potrayed beautifully in this piece and that really helped the reader get into the happiness and community like feel. Her gratefullness potrayed into the mood and made the entire piece fun to read.	2	2		2																					
4488	5	The mood the author portrays is love and unity. The author portrays his love for his parents when he explains how selfless they were in immigrating to @LOCATION1, and sacrificing so much for the sake of their children. They also show unity by explaining how close everyone in his neighborhood and family are. They all share a similar culture, and they consider a lot of the people in their neighborhood family, even if they are not blood-relatives. A lot of their family lives close by, and they often spend time together, usually for meals as it says in paragraph @NUM1.	2	2		2																					
4489	5	"In the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez, from Home: The blue prints of our lives by Narciso Rodriguez, Narciso explains the mood of his home. One way is in para graph @NUM1 when he says ""Passionate Cuban music filled the air, mixed with the aromas of the Kitchen"". This @CAPS1 the mood of family. It gives you this sense of a warm family.Another way is in paragraph @NUM2. He says ""My parents always Kept their arms open to the many people we considered family"". This gives a loving and caring feeling. It also gives the sense of family.The last way Narciso explains the mood is in paragraph @NUM3. In this paragraph he just gives an overall warm and inviting mood. He says how appriciative of his parents he is. He really @CAPS1 the mood to be thank ful of everything they have done. These are a few ways Narciso @CAPS1 the mood of the memoir."	3	2		3																					
4495	5	the mood of the @CAPS1 in the article is like kind of happiness and @CAPS2, relax, and grateful. Because their grandparents are coming from Cuba. Narciso Rodriguez feels like being an immigrant from Cuba and making a family in the United States is hard. Because you have to start your whole life over so you can get a job and provide for your family. This is what I think the mood of the article is about in the memoir.	1	2		2																					
4496	5	In this memoir, the mood is very light hearted and kind. It gives you a feeling of peace and community.Several times the author tries to show appreciation. Not for any one thing in particular, just gratitude. For example, in paragraph @NUM1, he puts phrases in parentheses for no reason other than to show gratitude for his life as a child. As a result of this, while reading you get a feeling of peace and kindness.Because of his repeated display of gratitude, the mood is light hearted and unserious.	2	1		2																					
4501	5	I think in some parts @CAPS1 was happy. And then is other parts @CAPS1 was sad because @CAPS1 is talking about her first house in america. @CAPS1 is happy because @CAPS1 can look back on the memories and be happy.	1	1		1																					
4507	5	The mood in the memoir created by Narciso Rodriguez is a comfortable. It's comfortable because as I read the memoir it made me think of my own home life. And how important my family is to me. It also allowed to see how full and good his was to. I mean I love his descriptions of the food cooking in the kitchen and all the great smells. Also, the wonderfull music that played and the people that always came over to visit. And all that good family comfort that we all crave at one time or another. That's the feeling I get when I read Narciso Rodriguez's memoir.	2	3		3																					
4514	5	The mood created by the author was warm, welcoming, and gratefulness. When the author described his home, it gave a feeling of warmth and it was very welcoming. He made me feel like I was invited to his home with open arms and I could feel the environment around me. He gave of a feeling of gratefulness when he explained how grateful he was to his parents for sacraficing everything and how much he appreciates everything they have done for him. He showed in the passage the warmth and love in his home.	2	2		2																					
4516	5	His mood was like happy and unsatisfying at the same time. They also say like how his/her life is so I think this book is good to. Or we can say article. It's like all about how his/her life story is.	0	0		0																					
4519	5	The mood created by the author was grateful and happy. The mood was grateful because Narciso was glad his parents moved to the @LOCATION1 and started their wonderful home. Narciso was grateful of this because he grew up in an environment he loved.                                                                                                                                                     The mood created by the author is happy. The mood is happy because Narciso is happy that he grew up around people who loved him. This made him happy because he knew that he was safe and loved with these people. When his community of differences came together to form one community, this made Narciso happy. The mood is both grateful and happy. I would also be grateful for this, happiness is key to having friendships and famalies.	3	2		2																					
4520	5	In the memoir Narciso Rodriguez, the mood is set to reflect family values and memories. For example in paragraph @NUM1 she explains that her family is From Cuba and they raised her in a replica of a traditional Cuban home. She tells us that her parents bolth cook traditional Cuban foods and teach her how to cook as well. Then another example is from paragraph @NUM2 when she tells us that her family stays with her a lot, such as uncles aunts, cousins, grandparents, they @CAPS1 stay whith her until they are able to get on their feet again. Finaly in paragraph @NUM3, @NUM4 and @NUM5 It explains the sacrifice that her parents had to give in order to start a new life in the US, and about how her familly takes in other refuges and also about how she will never forget her parents and all the memories that go along with the house.	2	3		3																					
4521	5	The mood of this memoir is love and staying a family. The author sends a message to her readers when one leaves what they once had. Her tone tells the mood by writing with passion. The mood is basically is being happy with what you have. that's how the family written about acts in this memoir.	2	2		2																					
4531	5	"The mood created by the author of the memior exposed various emotions and contrast. In paragraphs @NUM1 and @NUM2, the author talks alot about culture, he explains how they could not live without having their practice, in their lives. ""Rich culinary Skills and the love of cooking (and for which I am internally grateful). Passionat Cuban music (which I adore to this day) ...""In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity"". Another mood the author captures is greatfullness. In paragraph six the author explains how he is so grateful for the strength and courage his parents showed from moving away from Cuba. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing that I could have done."" The final way the author creates a mood is during the last sentence of the memoir. The author states ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote captures the mood of being thankful for the unity of his family. He looks up to his parents for making his life as great as it is today. These are some moods the author creates throughout the memoir."	3	3		3																					
4532	5	"Througout the story, Narciso Rodriguez shows examples of how grateful, loved, and unified his family felt with their struggles they had overcame and heritage they were proud of. Paragraph @NUM1 illustrates the fond memories Narciso has of his house and childhood. Paragraph @NUM2 displays Narciso's strong sense of family within his local @CAPS1 community. Paragraph @NUM3 explains Narciso's parents' rough journey from Cuba to @LOCATION1, and paragraph @NUM4, Narciso explains how grateful he is for his parents' hard work and determination for their children to have a good life.

4541	5	"The mood that the author was trying to create was a sense of hope, family and happiness. Hope was @CAPS1 because his family helped others by letting them temporarily stay with them until they got back on there feet which provided hope for the extended family. Family was @CAPS1 be cause in the last paragraph he is explaining how in this tiny apartment you learned the definition of ""family"" through welcoming refugees and celebrating his first birthdays and having a loving, careing enviroment. Finally I think happiness was @CAPS1 because he was explaining how grateful he was for his parents coming to america to give him a better life and also in paragraph two he was explaining how his home environment was filled with cooking and music which can be factors of happiness. These are some moods that the author was trying to show."	2	2		2

Narciso tells how his parents sacrificed everything in Cuba for him. The whole neighbor was tight-knit and loved each other. Family was defiantly a huge part of Narciso's life and he expressed that with his writing. His home was a ""traditional Cuban home"". By having his heritage surrounding him, his childhood was very pleasant. ""Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our new home"". Narciso sets a loving mood with his great family and home memories."	3	2		3

Those with the moods of the story"	2	2		2																					
4584	5	The mood created by the author was a happy and exciting mood. This is because the family was so excited about moving to a new place with better oppertunities and educational purposes. It also changed a regular house into a special home for them because they had people over and over and over which finally became family. The neighbors also helped create the mood by not creating any negative action or violence in the author put the family's location in a non-american neighborhood.	2	2		2																					
4597	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir would be grateful and happy. It really makes you wanna think about life and how good it is, thanks to parents and grandparent, even anchestors. It makes you want to love your parents even more seeing how they went through alot and probably gave up alot for you. Like leaving their homeland or giving up great things like @ORGANIZATION1 and Narciso Rodriguez Sr did for their family or son. They wanted a better life and education for their kids. They had to leave their homeland, where they were born and raised and give up some things to get better things. They had to give up their job and skill's they already knew how to do for better things. The good thing that happened or that they get is more freedom and better life and education, it's not easy leaving everything you love and where you are born but has to be done for better things and opportunities. Reading this memoir gives you or leaves you with a satisfying, grateful, happy and kinda sad mood.	3	3		3

4613	5	"In the memoir, ""Narciso Rodriguez"", the mood is very grateful. All throughout the story, the other kept stating that he is extremely grateful to his parents for their selflessness and care. This mood shows most in paragraph @NUM1 because he continually thanks his parents for moving to the United States from Cuba to help him when he is born. He thanks them for leaving their friends, family and jobs to help him, even if the new jobs they get are not what they deserve.So, as you can see, the author is very grateful to his parents, making this the mood."	2	1		2

4622	5	The mood of the memoir I believe to be grateful or enspioring. Narciso's parents are imigrants from Cuba who live in a rasict community and are working to be able to support there kids. They are great parents to Narciso and provide him with basic nacessidies. They feed him, and buy him clothes.

4637	5	the mood created by the @CAPS1 is a serious mood. The mood is serious because he is explaining his childhood and his home. he explains how his parents raised him. He also explained how his parents left. That was the mood of the @CAPS1.	1	2		2																					
4647	5	In the excerpt, the author creates a loving mood. It mentions that Narciso will always be grateful to his parents for their love and sacrafice. That's telling us they get along well and really care for eachother. And then there is his siblings that live in different parts of the apartment. They help set the table and eat with them so I can tell they are all really loving and caring and all enjoy being a family together. This why I believe the author is creating a loving, and peaceful mood.	2	2		2																					
4649	5	"In the passage ""Narciso Rodriguez from home: the blueprints of our lives,"" written by Narciso Rodriguez @CAPS1 ponders, and re-memmorates past events about his parents home in Newark, New Jersey. The author creates a suttle, but happy memory in the passage.                                                                                                                            The first reason to why the mood is a suttle, but happy one would be because their are serious parts of the passage, and happy parts of the passage. In paragraph four Narciso recalls having a lot of his family members living near his familys his house. When @CAPS1 says, ""Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regulary joined us at our table."" @CAPS1 refers to the supper table when @CAPS1 says, ""our table."" The mood gets suttle when @CAPS2 talks about being greatfull to his parents for coming to @CAPS3 as immigrants with no working knoledge of @CAPS4 language, or writing. @CAPS1 also says in paragraph five, ""to give their children a better life."" @CAPS5 these are many terrific details to explain the mood that Narciso is trying to put into this passage."	3	3		3

He talks about the music and food of his childhood but he also talks about his Extended ""family"" and how they always had someone staying in the house until they could get back on their feet. He also talks about how the House dosn't make a home- its the people that do. If no one lived in a House it could never be called a home. The family and friends @CAPS2 bring it closer and closer to being a Home."	2	2		2																					
4654	5	"In this memoir Narciso talks about his life. As @CAPS1 talk @CAPS1 always creates a @NUM1 creates a mood by talking about his environment. In paragraph @NUM2 it say, ""that ""family"" had nothing to do with being blood relative."" @CAPS1 created a good mood cause @CAPS1 knows @CAPS1 has a lot of friends.Secondly, Narciso creates a mood talking about his first friend. In paragraph @NUM3 it says, Alegria lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen tables for meals more often than not.

4657	5	"There are many ways to describe the mood of the author in this memoir. I think the overall feeling and mood in the memoir is happiness and greatfulness. Narciso Rodriguez's parent were from Cuba and they werent very wealthy. Narciso grew up in a three room apart ment in a niehgborhood filled with immigrants from Cuba, @LOCATION1, and @LOCATION2. Narciso had great parents according to the memoir it says in paragraph seven, last sentence ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home."" @CAPS1 means that @CAPS1 didn't care about the amount of space they had in the apartment @CAPS1 just cared and love the amount of love and the relationship they all had eachother."	2	2		2																					
4660	5	"It was a very high up, cheerful mood. It made me feel as if I was there. In paragraph @NUM1 it said ""I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". That means he thanks his parents for all the hard work they did. The @CAPS1 they made. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it said ""my mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the Culture"". He is proud of his parents on coming from their country and speaking a different language and learning a new one is hard. All in all it was a very high up, cheerfull mood."	2	2		2

His parents loved him and sacrificed a lot for him. His simple house was a home. These things created the happy and thankful mood"	2	2		2																					
4667	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is that of love, kindness, and welcome. This is true because the author uses adjectives such as passionate, warm, humble, and simple to describe how the family lives surrounded by kind people with a loving ambience. Also, the author describes how his family always welcomed others into their home and received a similar kindness back. This, @CAPS1 describes, is because they consider everyone as family, which, as Narciso believes, is because of their love for each other. finally, the author explains how @CAPS1 is extremely grateful to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 states that @CAPS1 ""thanked them repeatedly."" This also shows how Narciso wrote his memoirs to be full of love, especially for his parents, which dictated the mood of the piece."	3	3		3

4682	5	In the memoir the author created the mood of being happy and joyfull. One reason I feel this way is by the way he talks about what goes on in his home. Like when he talks about the hart of the home being the kitchen and how his parents passed on the skills and a love for cooking to him in paragraph @NUM1. Another reason I feel this way is the way he describes the types of friendships he has with is neighborhood. Like in paragraph @NUM2 he talks about how all of the different cultures come together and have great friendships with each other. As I read this it makes me think of all the fun and joyfull things that happened at my house and wonder what else will happen at my house in the future.	2	3		3																					
4683	5	The mood in the @CAPS1 is happy. Happy because Narciso is happy to have a home and family. He is happy about the courage his parents have. He is happy that he is loved.

4713	5	I feel like the mood in the memoir is being grateful for your family for many reasons.      My first reason is Narciso's parents came to @LOCATION1 from Cuba just to make sure that there kids will have a good life.       Another reason is his parents did hard labor and worked really hard to make he a good life. They also made there house feel like a home for their son.

4727	5	The mood created by the author in this memoir is peaceful and loving. Narciso really believes that the definition of home is relationships & love rather than furniture and expenses. His home sounds really great because the way it is described in the memoir, you can see that his family are very caring and selfless people. The fact that his parents take in strangers and allow them to stay at their home really shows that they are very caring people.	2	2		2																					
4730	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir. Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that family had nothing the memoir life was hard. Quite the contrary our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban and Italian immigrants at a time when overt recism. in their neighborhood despite customs elsewhere all of these cultures came together in great solidary and friendship. Over all these was hard for the author memoir	2	0		1

To my knowledge, there aren't any grave, dark, sad parts of his life in the memoir. Finally, the author says that he is grateful for his rich culinary skills, passed down by his family, and his parents' love and sacrifice.

Narciso says how his parents gave him the love and skill to cook and how he still has that love and his love for Cuban music.

Instead of pointing out or remembering the bad things about his childhood, he writes about the good parts of his childhood. For example, his parents gave him oppurtunitys despite their struggle. His parents made their home a happy place to be, even though they were going through times of rasism and segregation. Also because of his parents positive attitude, it made him a positive person. Another reason the mood was heart-warming was now Narciso's parents demonstrated with their lives and teachings how important family and friends are. Narciso's parents have given up and done so much for him, resulting in who Narciso Rodriguez is today, makes this memoir truly heart-warming.	3	3		3

4900	5	"In this memoir the author has created more than just one mood. He has, in my opinion, created around three. Love, gratitude, and carring.The mood of love was created because in the memoir, Narciso Rodriguez tells us that family isn't just blood relatives. It can be anyone. In his case his whole neighbor hood was his family. Family can be anyone and to me family is or can be people that you love. That is how the mood of love was created by the author.When I read the memoir and got near the end, I personally felt the mood of gratitude. I felt that because the author is grateful for all the things his parents did for him, one example is when his parents left their hometown so that their son could have a better life. My parents did that for me, so I could relate on a personal level. I know I'm grateful for them making that big decision.I also think the mood of caring was created. I think that because in the memoir the author says that his parents would let people live with them until ""they got back on their feet."" I felt as if the family was caring doing that, its not like anyone would do that, so the family was caring. That is why I felt the mood caring was created by the author."	3	3		3

4953	5	The mood created by the author, Narciso Rodriguez is very happy and uplifting. The whole story is an optimistic view of Narciso's child hood. None of the bad parts of his childhood are written about. He writes about his perent's coming from Cuba and how some of his family would come and eat with them. Narciso's memoir is a happy look back at his child hood.Narciso is very grateful for his family, specifically his parents. They came from Cuba to @LOCATION1 to start a good life for their son. This causes the beginning this memoir to start off with a happy, uplifting mood. As the memoir progresses, it still maintains the same happy mood. Paragraph @NUM1 is a great example of how the mood created by the author is so happy. Paragraph @NUM1 talks about how Narciso's family would go to their house and share meals with them. Narciso was happy to be around his family. The best example of the mood created by Narciso is the final @NUM3 paragraph. Paragraph @NUM4 talks about Narciso's gratitude towards his parents. He loves them so much for coming to @LOCATION1 and leaving their promising jobs in Cuba to give Narciso a better life. The final paragraph talks about how Narciso's whole family a house into a home.

4954	5	In the article Narciso Rodriguez from Home: The Blueprints of our lives, the mood in this story is very happy, and heart warming. When she talks about how they have their own cultures, and live in the kitchen, and how the sit down at dinner together as a family, it makes the mood happy and wishing you were there. The different imigrants that live in the neighborhood that are very friendly and kind to one another and are hard working makes life there seem nice and easy going. I think how the parents give up everything like house, food, Cuba, and everything else in the gave up just for their kids to go to a good school, eat well, have friends, be near relatives and everything just to make their kids happy. That is a lot of work to have all of that especially in another country. Another happy thing they would do is with their lanlord they would set the table and eat good food and goof around and have fun. It is good to have friends and family that care about you and are willing to give up everything for you. It makes the mood happy.	3	2		3																					
4961	5	"In the story Narciso Rodriguez a certain mood is created. For example, one mood is love. @CAPS1 family did everything for love. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us."" This quote shows @CAPS1 family took care of everyone even thought they did not have much themselves.Another example of mood is being together Narciso's family helped out all imagrants to get back on their feet. Paragraph @NUM2 says, ""they came selflessly, as many imagrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved."" Narciso's family helped the less fortunate very often. The mood of this story is very inviting and peaceful."	3	3		3																					
4964	5	"I think the mood created by the author was very warm, greatful and happy. I think this because he often expresses how his parents sacrificed a lot of things and made his childhood ful of joyous memories. ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" In many paragraphs he explains how he admires them for their strength and perseverance in moving from Cuba to @LOCATION1. I also said happy because he is happy that his childhood was so memorable. ""Innocence of childhood... endless celebrations."" This shows me that he enjoyed the parties and being a kid. (growing up in that household.) This is why I think the mood is so grateful and happy."	2	2		2

4971	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is talking about this boy's life and about his parents and what they do for a living and what they are and how they are nice to other people....

4977	5	"The tone of Narciso Rodriguez's memoir was a happy one with many positive feelings, memories, and undertones mixed in. Rodriguez sets the mood in the @NUM1 paragraph when @CAPS2 describes the warm, inviting, and cozy feeling that was given off at his home. Here @CAPS2 describes how ""passionate Cuban music... filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen."" This gives off a warm, innocent vibe, staging the mood for the memoir @CAPS1, in paragraph @NUM2, the mood is expanded so that it also encopasses the welcoming feel of the house. Here, Rodriguez says that his ""parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people [they] considered family"". Finally, this excerpt gives off a proud and graceful mood. This pride and gratitude from Narciso Rodriguez is directed toward his parents @CAPS2 uses many words like ""courage"", ""selflessly"", ""struggled"", ""braving"", and ""hardships"" to describe Rawedia and @PERSON2's actions with a proud undertone Rodriguez then talks about how grateful @CAPS2 is to his parents ""for their love and sacrifice"" (paragraph @NUM3). Then @CAPS2 goes on to talk about how deeply grateful @CAPS2 is towards his parents for all they did for him in great detail.

4989	5	"Based on the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" by Narciso Rodriguez, the mood created by the author is peaceful because the whole memoir is talking about love and care for each other and your family.In this memoir there are many times where the author discusses his love for cooking. ""It was the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with not just scent in music but life in love"". This quote shows that Cuban feasts caused him to experience life and love with his family and loved ones. ""It was here where I learned the real definition of family"". This proves that his life in New Jersey at his house helped him realize the true meaning of family. The last quote that made this memoir peaceful was when he said, ""And for this, I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood where the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home"". This quote shows the love and affection that Narciso Rodriguez feels about his parents and his home.After reading this memoir, that was the mood that was created by the author in this memoir."	3	3		3																					
4990	5	"The mood created by narciso Rodriguez was appreciation, or that's what I got out of it. Throughout the whole memoir, narciso's affectionate language and explanation to his life and his parents was constant and grasping. In paragraph two, he uses perenthesis as if his gratitude is so strong, that he can't bear to leave out how thankful he is. He set the scene with new experience and inspiration, Which he always thanked his parents for introducing him to. ""I will always be grataful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I've often told them What they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done...""p. @NUM1.

Also the author portrays how thankful and grateful he is for everything he was taught, was sacrificed for him, and for the life lessons that were instilled in him.

The author also explains how grateful he is for everything his parents went through for him in paragraphs @NUM4 and @NUM5 giving mood of happiness and grateful ness. Narciso also creates a mood of love, as of that he had for his parents and ""family"" that he says transferred his house into a home in paragraph @NUM6."	3	3		3																					
4993	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is very happy and warm. The author talks about how grateful Narciso Rodriguez is. Narciso also loves the home he grew up in. He also talks about all the people that live near him and how he loves them all like family. His parents are very good cooks, and they taught Narciso their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with him today. His mood is very loving and caring, and its his family and how he adores them that is the mood created by the author in the memoir.	2	2		2																					
4996	5	The mood is @CAPS1. The story talks about Cuban culture. He talks about all the @CAPS1 times. All the time he spent with his family celebrating cuban herritage. They would all come over for dinner. Thats how he set the mood.	1	1		1																					
4998	5	"A wonderful mood was created by Narciso Rodriguez, the author, in this memoir. While reading this story, I could feel the love, peace, & appreciation created by his words. Throughout the memoir, he really expands on the love & appreciation he feels for his parents. Paragraph @NUM1 states: ""I'll always be grateful to my parents for their love & sacrifice."" Also, in paragraph @NUM2, he again mentions his parents & how they had turned a house into a home. You can feel his awe & appreciation spilling out of his words. Also, the childhood home is described in paragraph @NUM3. Rodriguez describes the house's feeling as warm & elaborates on the things he's grateful to and will always love. The mood of this memoir is very specifically felt."	3	3		3																					
4999	5	The mood created by the author in the memoir is made up of happeness, love, and lastly respect for his parents, whitch shows how the mood is actually peaceful. In the memoir the author stated memeries of his neighborhood that was good. The authors stated about how the cultures formed together, helped each other and worked hard to make a living as well is a future for their kids, which shows his respect for his friends and family. The author states his gratitude toward the hard ships his parents went through for him and for the dream of a better tomorrow.	2	1		2																					
5004	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is to show gratefulness towards the author's parents. He wanted to portray the fact that his parents sacrifice their lives for the author's life.Narciso repeatedly conveys the message that ""family had nothing to do with being a blood relative"", but people who care for one another; people who ""come together in great solidarity and friendship"".The most important family to Narciso are his parents who sacrifice their lives, in order ""to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved"". He says that he will always be grateful to his parents. He admits ""that what they did was a much more courageous thing than ""he"" could have ever done"". Narciso infact, cannot thank his parents enough for showing them how important family and friends are.In the end, @PERSON1 realizes that a home is a place you live, and celebrate birthdays, and do work, but mainly a place where everyone is welcome and a home is a family in itself."	4	3		3																					
5014	5	I would say the mood that the author was in was happy. I would say that because he always has something nice to say. He never gets into fights with his mother or father. He talks about how he is grace full. how he would never agure with his parents. How he's  always had a good life from when he was a kid to now when he is an @CAPS1. He was going to move into A new @NUM1 bedroom apartment soon. That way he can call It his home.	1	2		2																					
5016	5	"The mood created by the author in the memoir is a nice ""homie"" feeling. The author tries to let you know a home is more than physical walls it is a place for relationships are made. ""The congregation of family and friends."" The is is signifagant because all of the good times an celebrations occurred with the people he loved in his home. The author tries to show the love and affection throughout his home. ""always filled the air with not just sent in music but life and love."" The author shows the love that goes on throughout his home."	3	2		3																					
5018	5	"It creates a mood of happiness ""but Cuban music filled the air as it mixed with the aromas of the kitchen."" this shows what his home was like"	1	1		1																					
5019	5	"The mood created by the author in this memoir is the appreciation through the author's parents. Another mood is the happiness of ""home"" or family. In paragraph @NUM1, the author is grateful to her parents for their love and sacrifice and courage. In the last paragraph, paragraph @NUM2, Narciso mentions how welcomed refugees that just arrived to the country were at their house to stay, that the ""warmth of this Kitchen and humble house where a Cuban feast always filled the air with life and love"" made her learn the definition of ""family""."	2	2		2																					
5020	5	"In the memoir ""Narciso Rodriguez"" from ""Home: The Blueprints of our lives"" the mood created by the author is that his parents were loving and caring. His parents were loving and caring because they made their house into a home. His parents were selfless and caring when they come to the United States. In paragraph @NUM1 it says ""I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrafice"". This shows his parents were loving and made sacrafices for their children to have a good life. In paragraph @NUM2 it says ""they struggled both personally and financially"". This shows they cared about their family because they sacraficed things to struggle & make their family happy. In conclusion, the mood is being caring and loving."	3	3		3																					
5025	5	"The mood that the author in the memoir created was good by his love, his blood relative, and also by courage.To start with her love is like part of her life. He love his parents. For example In the storie say's ""I will always be grate ful to my parents for their love and sacrifice."" @CAPS1 this mean she loves he parent for every little single thing they did. Also he learn how to love people.As will as her blood relative meaning that he @CAPS2 got to do with nothing of this. She is from cuba, and came to the united state on 1956. Also born to this a simple house. His that build a traditional home.This is how the author describe the mood, by his love, his blood relative, and also by courage."	2	2		2

Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations"". This creates a warm mood because the kitchen seems like a very friendly place due to the people gathering together.Another way the author creates the mood is by saying that ""my parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we concidered family, knowing that they would do the same for us"". (paragraph @NUM2)These are the ways of the author of ""Narciso @CAPS1"" created the mood in this story."	2	2		2																					
5034	5	"The mood I think the author created in the memoir was love.The reason why I say love is because to me he cares about the his family and he also stayed with his family tradition and he care and follows them. He also loved being with his family. For example in paragraph @NUM1 in the article it say; ""I will never forget that house or it's gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to LOVE. I will never forget how my parents turned the simple house into a home. and to me that shows Love thats why I think the author created Love as his mood in the memoir."	2	2		2																					
5037	5	"The mood created in this memoir was manily for me family and Love. for most of the memoir the author was talking about exprens he had in the house, and the love he had's for his family and frend's. The first example I have for the mood is when he say's ""as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life."". This shows the parents love for the kids. a second example I have is for family when the reading say's ""growing up in this environment instilled in me a great senst that ""family"". and he is talking about thy are all so close nit. This reading was a good example of a closs nit comunity and of parent scracise. for they kid's."	2	2		2																					
5043	5	The author created such a specific mood for this memoir. She @CAPS1 off by telling alittle history of how she came to be in @LOCATION1 but quickly changed it to what her home was like. Narciso emphisized the importance of her culture but more importantly her family and friends. she talked about how the latin music, the big cuban cooking all made what is her home. She focuses more on the gratitude of her parents even more than her heritage and family bonds. She's focused on how her parents made a house a home.	2	2		2																					
5047	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they faced was the existing law against airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it illegal for the dirigible to tie up on the building. Another obstacle faced in allowing dirigibles to dock was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable. If a dirigible caught fire over the densely populated area of New York, there would be a good chance that many people would be hurt. A final obstacle faced was ""nature itself."" The winds on the top of the Empire State building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even though a dirigible would be attached to the mooring mast, the back of it would move around the mooring mast in a dangerous way. Many obstacles were faced by the workers of the Empire State Building in order to allow a dirigible to dock there."	3	3		3																					
5051	6	The builders of the Empire State Building a great idea. They wanted to be able to tethered dirigibles, or blimps, to the top of the building. However, there were many problems with this idea. First of all, blimps themselves were not very sturdy. Strong winds could easily blow dirigibles trying to dock into the spires of other buildings. Dirigibles also started to use hydrogen gas rather than Helium. Hydrogen gas is extremely flammable. The smallest the sparking could set the whole blimp ablaze. The docking system its self was also a problem. The only way to keep a dirigible level was to hang lead weights off the side. One concern was that a way could fall off and fall into the densely populated city below. This could've proved very disastrous!	3	3		3																					
5053	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock at the mooring mast. Al Smith was the architect, and man behind the idea of the Empire State building. He and the maker of the Chrysler building were competing against eachother to construct the world's tallest building. To make the Empire State building bigger than the Chrysler building, Smith was going to construct somthing that John Tauranac stated, ""Would be equipped for an age of transportation that was only the dream of aviation pioneers"". That dream was to travel by blimp. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for the dock of air ships. It was not going to be as easy as the concept. The architects couldn't drop a mooring mass on the roof because it would stress the buildings frame. The greatest reason the mast would never fufill its destiny was for safety. The excerpt states, ""Most derigibles used hydrogen"". Hydrogen is flammable. There was also a law that was, ""against air ships flying too low over urban areas"". After numberous attempts and modifications, the idea was shelved."	2	3		3																					
5055	6	"The @CAPS1 The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, shows the thoughtful, intelligent, yet obstacled ideas of attaching a landing dock to the Empire State building. The obstacles that builders of the Empire State building had to overcome were that wind speeds where the dirigibles would land were too strong and would whip the balloon around like a rag doll. They would ""have to use lead weights"" which would pose another problem, questioning the foundation of the building. The weight of the building also the weight of the lead weights might collapse the structure. The gases they use ""hydrogen and hellium"" make the balloon fly, but hydrogen ""is highly flamable and can't be used in populated areas."" There was ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 are the obstacles and the reason ""the mooring mast of The Empire State building was destined never to fullfill its purpose""."	3	3		3																					
5060	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in an attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One major obstacle was constructing a mooring mast that would not threaten the buildings structure. The builders had to modify and strengthen the frame of the Empire State Building. According to the excerpt ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the framework."" Another big obstacle was safety. At the Empire State Building's hight it would have been illegal to land a dirigible. The dirigibles, at that time, were filled with hydrogen. If the dirigible ever exploded, it would threaten the hundreds. of pedestrians on the streets of New York City."	3	3		3																					
5063	6	"The idea of mooring dirigibles to the top of the building that stood 1,250 feet above the streets of downtown New York was a facinating and amazing idea. An idea that would bring New York into a whole ""age of transportation"" (@NUM1). Unfortunately this wonderful idea had a few holes in the plans. Later the architects that were building the mooring mast had discovered that their idea was not going to be fulfill. The idea had too many obstacles to overcome. The fact that ""most dirigibles outside the U. S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@NUM2). If anything was to go wrong, it would be catostrophic seeing as how below them were highly populated streets. Also, ""the greatest obstacle was nature itself"" (@NUM3). There was just too much wind to keep the aircraft steady and undercontrol. The reality of the fact was that the idea to moor derigibles sounded great but there are far too many risks to carry out the plan."	2	4		2																					
5066	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, there was many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced with allowing diriibles to land there. One of the obstacles were the safety problems. The drigibles had to come close enough to the Empire State building so they could be able to tie the dirible down. This put the diribles too close to the people. There was a law that that stated that airships can't fly to low to urban areas. There was a disaster that happened in Lakehurst, New Jersey that they were trying to prevent from happening in New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another problem with that builders faced was that the strong winds of nature did not allow diribles to get close enough to tie down to the mast. There were many obstacles builders had to face that at the end it was not worth making the Empire state building a dirible dock."	3	3		3																					
5069	6	"the obstacles the builders went threw was using hydrogen which is flammable. Another one is the ""wind on the top of the building were constintly shifting due to violent air currents."" the third one is when the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. last but not least the law against airships flying to low over urban areas."	2	2		2																					
5070	6	There were many obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One obstacle was the wind. At higher elevation the wind is much more powerful. This would make it very difficult to accually get the dirigible close to the mast. Also the structure of of Empire State Building. The framework was not built for the amount of weight that would be on top of the building. Builders made over @MONEY1 worth of fortifying the framework. Those are some obstacles that builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
5076	6	The builder's of the Empire State Building faced many difficult obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. The greatest obstacle of the use of a mooring mast was the wind. At the top of the Empire State Building the winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The winds would cause the back of the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. Another reason the dirigibles would not be able to more at the Empire State Building is because there is a law that says airships cannot fly low in urban areas. This would make it illegal for the dirigible to approach or dock at the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
5079	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are described. One obstacle was that most dirigibles were highly flammable. In paragraph @NUM1 it says, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible caught on fire near the Empire State Building, the accident would affect many people since its a densely populated area. Another obstacle the builders faced was the winds of nature itself. Even if a dirigible was docked, it would still swivel around too much. In paragraph @NUM2 it says, ""... they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" One more obstacle they faced was an existing law. In paragraph @NUM3 it says, ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" The architects faced many obstacles while trying to bring their idea to reality. It's better to plan ahead and think of every obstacle before bringing ideas to life."	3	3		3																					
5080	6	The builders had a very hard time because of where it was located, and how the dirigible was to dock. Their first problem was the fact that it was so tall, it was hard to work on. Another problem was the fact that the blimp would be pulling in on the building, so it had to be reinforced. The final problems that made them most an unreliable choice, were the wind conditions and the fact that the tail end of the blimp could swing freely. These all contributed to make the mast on the Empire State Building a bad idea.	2	1		2																					
5081	6	"From the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the architechs building the Empire state building faced many obstacles. in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. An obstacle they faced in attempting to let the drigbles to dock there we're the winds. As it says in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around..."" The dirigible would not be stable. Another obstacle they faced was to weigh it down, they'd have to use lead weight but it wouldnt be ""practical nor safe"" dangling high above people in @LOCATION1 on the Street. Overall The architecs faced a lot of obstacles for docking the dirigibles, Most being either practical or not safe."	2	2		2																					
5085	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" written by @PERSON1, there were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with that should have been apparent before they built the mast. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" It says in the ""The Mooring Mast"" that at the top of the building winds were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also if the dirigibles were tethered, the back of them would move around while the dirigibles would also be high above the city with people watching. Unsafe for many. ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" It's illegal for a ship to tie up with the building or to even go to an area like that. These thing should have been brought to the builders attention with obstacles such as nature and lawbreaking are in play."	2	3		3																					
5093	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For one thing, the builders couldn't simply place a mast on top of the empire state building, because the building would surely collapse. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the empire state building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"". To change and fix this problem, over sixty thousand dollars would be needed for the modifications. Another obstacle the builder's failed to see was the actual construction of a modern-day dirigible. The dirigibles, ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly Flammable"". If the dirigibles were to ever explode while docking, the situation would have been horrible over a densely populated area of New York. Lastly, the greatest obstacle of the building was nature itself. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around"". this would be very dangerous. The dirigible could @CAPS1 over pedestrians the streets meaning it was not safe at all. There are three obstacles that prevented the empire state building from allowing dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
5094	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders faced obstacles such as how the dirigibles would stay tied to the mast. They weren't sure as to how they would keep the dirigible from swiveling from air currents. As said in paragraph @NUM1, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's framework."" Another problem faced was the use of hydrogen in the dirigibles made them highly flammable."	2	2		2																					
5096	6	"In @PERSON1's excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Although dirigibles were a modern form of transportation they were highly dangerous. As it states in paragraph @NUM1, ""Most dirigibles from outside of the U.S used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen in highly flammable."" This along with the ""violent air currents"" as stated in paragraph @NUM2, were two of the risks that the builders had to take into consideration. The builders needed to converse the idea of a safe way in which dirigibles could dock there insuring that no one gets hurt. Another obstacle the builders had to take into consideration was the law passed in which was, ""against airships flying to low over urban areas,"" as explained in paragraph @NUM3. The excerpt clearly explains the complications the builders had to endure and take into thought when constructing the Empire State Building. In conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building underwent many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	3	3		3																					
5097	6	There are many obstacles that the builders face when creating the empire state building.  First off the height of the building more come into question as much and there were to many discussions about the Top of the building.  The empire state buildings first goal was to be the future of city they wanted to food people onto blimp.  another problem is where really is know way to get the blimp steady enough to stick to the building and the large aircrafts are not suppose to fly back close to the building because other building are around.  In conclusion, they did face many problems.	0	2		1																					
5099	6	The greatest abstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. There were high violent air currents causing the building to constantly shift. It was neither practical nor safe.	1	1		1																					
5101	6	"In the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, many obstacles of building the Empire State building as a docking station for dirigibles are describle. John Tauranac, the man who came up with the plan to dock dirigibles on the top of the empire state building forgot some very important things to take into account. First the entire building would have to be modified because ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stres to the building's frame"" (paragraph @NUM1). The second problem that would need to be solved would be the safety of the city. Many ""dirigibles from outside United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM2.). If an accident like German dirigible Hindenburg happened, it would be ten times worse. Lastly, the ""violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM3) would pose as one of the greatest obstacles. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to tie up but could not get close enough because of ""forceful wind."" (paragraph @NUM4). The obstacles of making the empire state building into a mooring mast caused too many obstacles that could not be solved."	3	3		3																					
5105	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. In paragraph @NUM1, the excerpt tells the reader of a huge issue. It states, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of a building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame."" Due to this over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Another set back is in paragraph @NUM2. It states, ""The greatest obstacle... was nature itself."" Due to violent air current, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Tethering the mooring mast would do little help. Lead weights could not be used. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""dangling weights high above pedestrians..., was neighter practical nor safe."" All of these obstacles showed architects, the project at that time was impossible."	3	3		2																					
5117	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock. Firstly, the thousand foot dirigible would attach to the buildings by a single cable, adding stress to the frame of the building. The builders were forced to modify and strengthen the foundation to address the issue of stability. similarly, builders had to deal with the issue of wind pressure which were constantly shifing at heights of over @NUM1 feet in the air. The load of the dirigible swinging in the breeze would transmit pressure and stress onto the buildings foundation. This was a high safety concern, and pivotal to the decision that dirigibles could not dock at the empire state building. Lastly, builders were forced to face the law against airships flying too low over urban areas, making it illegal for dirigibles to even attempt to land on the mooring mast. The builders faced significant obstacles such as building weakness, safety, and law enforcement, that made attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State's mooring mast, virtually impossible.	3	3		3																					
5119	6	"Though in theory the idea of the mooring mast seemed attainable, in reality there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. An initial problem was faced during the process of adding the mooring mast to the building. As stated in the article: ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. ... The steel frame... would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new situation."" This modification, necessary to overcome the obstacle of attaching the mooring mast consumed over @NUM1 thousand dollars and much time and effort. A second obstacle which interfered immensely with safety was ""nature itself."" The violent winds at the top of the building would cause tethered dirigibles to ""swivel around and around"" the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in airfields could be weighted down by lead weights, but this idea could not be executed because ""... using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Such problems as these created many obstacles for the builders of the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
5121	6	"The architects of the Empire State building believed that dirigibles were able to dock on the building if there was a mooring mast. However there were many obstacles to over-come to allow this to happen. If a dirigible landed on the mast, it would force a lot of pressure on the building as it swayed in the wind. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored... would add stress to the buildings frame."" And as nature played a role, the wind could swing the body of the dirigible possibly causing the frame of the building to break and the building to collapse.Another obstacle that the architects faced was danger. American dirigibles used helium, while dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen, which is highly flammable. ""... the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey..."" The architects realized that they Hindenburg explosion would have been worst if it occurred on the Empire State building ""... above a densely populated area...""."	3	3		3																					
5122	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring @CAPS1"" by Marcia Amidon lusted theres alot of problems when trying to add a dock for dirigibles at the top. One problem or obstacle was the safety of the dirigible itself, ""most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly inflammable."" (@NUM1). Another obstacle was nature itself, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@NUM2). The last problem was the existing law aganist airships flying too low over cities or urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" (@NUM3). These are three reasons why in the excerpt ""The mooring @CAPS1"" by marcia Amidon lusted that there were alot of problems when trying to add a dock for drigibles."	3	3		3																					
5127	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obsticales in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem with the height and alltitude of the Zeppelin. Even if they docked, the back of it would be moving around everywhere from the wind. Another reason was that on May 6, 1937 the Hindenburg was burned to the ground after takeoff. witch means that it was very flamable from using hydrogen instead of helium. All raised safty issues that needed to be sought out.	2	2		2																					
5128	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were long; some were as long as one thousand feet. Dirigibles were docked by an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front to the back. The architects could not drop a mooring mast on top of the building. A one thousand-foot dirigible held by only a single winch would be to heavy for the buildings frame. In order for it to work it would have to be strengthened to accommodate the one thousand foot dirigibles. This would be a process worth over sixty thousand dollars, just for the framework. Another obstacle was safety. Dirigibles out of the United States contained helium meaning it was highly flammable. If an accident would occur like in Lakehurst, New Jersey then a lot more people would be harmed considering downtown New York was densely populated. Other obstacles were made for the builders of the Empire State building which proves that it was not a good idea to dock dirigibles.	3	3		3																					
5130	6	During the construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building the builders faced several obstacles. The greatest obstacle was @CAPS1 Nature. The winds at this height are shifting to frequently causing the dirigible to be tossed around the mast, making it unsafe to board. Another obstacle was how they weighed dirigibles down with lead weights. Having lead weights at this height was risky because they could plummet down upon the people below. The third obstacle was a law against the airships flying too low in urban areas. This made it impossible for any dirigible to dock or even come near the Empire State Building. These obstacles forced the builders to shelf the mooring mast construction.	3	3		3																					
5132	6	"In the piece ""The Mooring MAst,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, it describes what the mast on the Empire State Building was really for. There were many obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to @CAPS1 on the mast. One problem they faced was that the dirigible landed on the roof would add stress to the building's frame. The stress and wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation of the building. This means the building would have to be modified and strengthened. Safety was also a big issue for the mast. Because the dirigibles used hydrogen, it could catch on fire and be destroyed over a densely populated area. Another obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting. This made the back of the ship swivel around. Lastley, it was not successful is because of the law against airships flying too low. Before the constructors built all this extra to the building they should have thought of all the defects it could have."	3	3		3																					
5138	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were wheather. Nature itself would ruin the time frame of building. Winds would shift, even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.Another challenge the builders ran into was that dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.	2	2		2																					
5140	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced while trying to dock dirigibles. One obstacle was nature. At the top of the building, the winds constantly changing because violent air currents. This would make a ship swivel around dangerously. Even if it was tied in the back would move. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of ship with swivel."" Another obstacle was safety. Foreign ships use hydrogen, and extremely flammable gas. In fields, they use lead weights to weight down. If an accident happened with either it would be extremely fatal. A flaming dirigible or a falling metal object  at extreme heights would cause serious injuries because the landing is above a highly populated city. ""Dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 use hydrogen... is highly flammable."" ""Could be weighted down by lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be hanging high above pedestrians on the street."" A law forbids ships to fly in low urban areas so, if the moore worked it couldn't be used. These events led to the quiet dissaperance of the thought in the late 1930's."	3	3		3																					
5143	6	There were several obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first problem they faced was they would have to change & fix the @CAPS1 of the Building in order to compensate for all the Stress there would be on the Building when the dirigibles landed. After they constructed & built the landing, there were several more problems. The first problem was that the hydrogen in the balloons is very flammable. This is a problem because New York is densely populated & with a flammable substance above there heads, it poses a threat. The second problem was the dirigible itself. It can easily blow in the wind, & would constantly wave in the wind, & unlike in a field, weights cold not be tied to the back of it because of the crowds below. The third & final problem they dealt with was the law: airships are not allowed too fly low over urban areas. The Empire State Building was too low in an urban area for anything to fly over it. Several of these problems led to the failure of the original idea & left the Empire State Building with a tall post of no purpose.	3	3		3																					
5145	6	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, was that it wouldnt be able to tie cable tether, because it adds stress to the buildings frame. Also in the story they tell you how the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommadate to the new situation.	2	1		2																					
5150	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were that most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Another reason was the wind. The winds on top of the building were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" It will not be safe for the pedestrians below the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
5153	6	In the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, obsticals of the Empire State Building faced to attempemt to allow dirigibles to dock there were enginering challenges. A problem with the docking was that the building was complete before the idea came to mind. A second problem was that the whole skeletal structure had to be changed in order for dirigibles to be able to dock. Then the question on how the airships, dirigibles, would stay next to the building. These were harder problem after it was illigale to have dirigibles to be close to buildings as well. Plus the fact that if they crash they are flamable and could kill people. Those are some facts that made it difficult for the Empire State building to build a dirigibles docks in the novel, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted.	3	3		3																					
5157	6	"In the excerpt ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle that the builders faced was safety.  In paragraph @NUM1, it was said that ""most dirigibles from outside of the @CAPS2 used hydrogen rather than helium"", now hydrogen is highly flammable. In paragraph @NUM2, it states that ""if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around"", now thats niether practical nor safe. If the ship is tied, the back should be stable. The last obstacle that the builders faced was a law against airships flying too low. In paragraph @NUM3, it applies that ""this law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Though some ships did attempt to reach the building, there was no success in that."	3	2		3																					
5159	6	"Builders had to face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The biggest obstacle is that it is unsafe to have it dangling over the city and thousands of pedestrians. The dirigibles would be held by a single cable tether and that would add a lot of stress on the buildings frame. Another big obstacle they faced was nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" Over @MONEY1 would be needed for this to happen."	2	2		2																					
5161	6	"In building the dirigible docks on the Empire State Building builders faced an onslaught of problems that should have been easy to pick up on. Everyone got caught up in the hype in my opinion. Outside of the U.S., other dirigibles used hydrogen, which is highly flammable, instead of helium. After the Hindenburg disaster, ""... the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" Winds also played an obstacle in the construction. ""... the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" The dirigibles would not be able to tie to the dock and stay because of violent air currents. There was a law holding airships from flying too low in urban areas. ""The law would make it illegal for air ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area...,"". Finally, times changed and planes became the new fad for air transport, ending dirigibles run as the main provider."	3	3		3																					
5162	6	"The empire state building builders had to face hard obstacles by.... ""accommodating passengers,"" new routes, and the greatest obstacle was to nature itself. By accommodating the passengers they had to bring them to the existing transatlantic routes. This was because the new routes weren't made yet. Reasoning being is because the building needed to be more taller. So then they added more things on the top of it. They wanted the State Building to nature itself because the building @CAPS1 Shifting from ""violent air currents"". Also the dirigible was more open fields to the moor. The State building also was weight down by the lead weights."	1	1		1																					
5163	6	There are a few obstacles the builders faced when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One was the violently changing wind currents at the height the docking to place. This would move the blimp and possibly send it into another building, puncturing the side of the balloon. Dirigible after dirigible being docked would put a lot of stress on the building itself. It would disrupt the frame and possibly effect the building as a whole. Also most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable as seen in the Hindenburg disaster. Due to all these reasons the mooring mast never saw a docked blimp.	3	3		3																					
5166	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, had many obstacles of the construction of the Empire State Building in allowing dirigibles to dock there. The author states ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" That law was considered illegal for a ship to approach the area and to get tied up to the building. Another obstacle was the lack of landing area, it was a challenge to expand in New York City, causing it hard to land dirigibles. The greatest obstacle was nature itself, the weather would cause the dirigibles to swivel around the mooring mast. The author states, ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights... dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."""	3	3		3																					
5177	6	Many obstacles stood in the way of docking the dirigibles on the empire state. One obstacle the builders faced was the law stating airships couldn't fly too low over urban areas. Also, the builders would have to reinforce parts of the building to support the stress the dirigibles would place on the frame.Lastly, nature would not allow the dirigibles to be safely docked due to the fact the violent winds would shift the back of the dirigible making it sway wildly. These obstacles made sure that dirigibles could not be docked at the empire state.	3	3		3																					
5185	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted there are many obstacles that the builders stumble across. Many people would have a hard time with creating the docs for the dirigibles for the Empire State Building. One major obstacle that the builders had was ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area."" Another obstacle that they could come across is that the dirigibles could take to long to fuel up and could cause a jam with other dirigibles. Even though they had this huge obstacle they managed to get their way and they found a way to actually use the dirigibles without any types of problems."	1	1		1																					
5188	6	In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. So Al Smith thought putting a mooring mast at the top of the building, would allow dirigibles to dock there several hours. It would allow the dirigibles to refuel or get serviced and let passengers on and off. Another obstacle would be how the dirigible would be moored. It would be held by a single cable tether, which would add stress to the frame of the building. The stress of the load and wind pressure would have to be transferred all the way to the foundation of the building, which was about eleven hundred feet below. Third obstacle would be using hydrogen or helium. If they used hydrogen it is highly flammable, and the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire. Those are some of the obstacles the builders had to face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																					
5192	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the architects faced many problems. One of these problems was the buildings frame. The frame needed to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the new mast. Another huge obstacle was safety. In paragraph @NUM1 the author states, ""hydrogen is highly flammable."" If a dirigible were to go up in @CAPS1 not only the passengers would be in danger but everybody on the crowded streets below. The winds at such a high altitude also posed a threat. Paragraph @NUM2 explains that the violent air currents would cause the back of the ship to swivel all over the place, making it hard for passengers to unload. These were just some of the many problems builders faced while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
5195	6	The obstacles the builders fact was that they could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. The Steel Frame of the Empire state Building would have to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new situation. The greatest reason was safety: most dirigibles from outside of the united states used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. existing law against airships flying too low.	3	3		3																					
5197	6	The building was big and beatful.	0	0		0																					
5207	6	One of the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced was that the construction of the mooring mast would add stress to the building due to its height. The architects, however, were able to design a special type of stainless steel that would be illuminated from the inside and provide support. Another obstacle was that the dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and having such an airship with flammable gas nearby civilization was considered unreasonable. Thus, a law was passed that forbid the transportation of dirigibles close to the public. Nature was also against the architects, and so posed a safety hazard when high-speed winds attempted to @CAPS1 the dirigibles from the sky while being weighed down with lead weights. In the end, the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was never used due to these issues.	3	3		3																					
5214	6	"There were obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example, on the excerpt is says, ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on."" This shows that builders had to build a mooring mast to have some time for refueling or service and have people get off and on safe.Another example from the excerpt is when it says, ""The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform."" This shows that the builders build a gangplank for people can walk up or down the gangplank safe from the dirigible."	2	1		2																					
5216	6	The @CAPS1 of the Empire State building faced many Problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Some of the problems are some blimps are filled with hydrogen wich is highly flammable. If a blimp with hydrogen in it exploded over @LOCATION1 that would not turn out so good For people in New York City. Those people could die. Also one one blimp exploded in New Jersey the blimp had hydrogen in it. So when that happened they thought a lot about the docking station and only to allow blimps with helium in them to dock there.	2	1		2																					
5228	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced multiple potential problems in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, the strong winds up above the city streets could have caused the dirigible's back and to blow sideways and puncture on the tops of other buildings. On top of that, many dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, making them highly flammable. Also, the added stress of a dirigible moored on the Empire State Building could have easily cracked or collapsed the building and its foundation. Luckily, the builders and engineers behind the mooring mast had enough sense to cease production of the mast, because it was merely an excuse to cover up the competitive nature of the building's designers.	2	3		3																					
5229	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles trying to allow dirigibles (blimps) to dock there. Lack of a suitable landing area was a tough obstacle. It is against the law for airships to fly low over urban areas. It would be dangling high above people and it wouldn't be safe. The way the dirigibles stays up in the air is it uses hydrogen instead of helium yet hydrogen is extremely flammable. To have a dock for the dirigibles on the Empire State Building it would not be safe and the builders would have to think of a new plan therefore, there would be many obstacles.	2	2		2																					
5231	6	"In this @CAPS1 ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 the builder of the empire State building faced many @CAPS2 during the building of the Empire State building.The @CAPS3 obstacle would be the wind. Because The building was so high And the more up the more Air and wind they had to stop landing or Drop off the dirigible. A dirigible is also a ballon or blump but there different because the dirigibles can be controlled by pappellers. Another reason was the @CAPS4 equpment. They didnt have the right equipment to dock the dirigible. So they @CAPS5 from letting them dock there ever again. They also @CAPS6 to stop it because it's over hundreds of civilians and if something goes @CAPS4 the balloon could fall on the civilizians.Those Are the reasons Why in the @CAPS1-""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1 had to face problems with docking ballons."	3	2		3																					
5236	6	The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. One obstacle they faced was that if a thousand-foot dirigible was moored at the top of the building by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the building's frame. Another obstacle they faced was that most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen not helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around the mooring mast. Those are some of the obstacles they faced trying to dock on the building.	3	3		3																					
5241	6	"In the excerpt there were a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The largest issue with allowing the dirigibles to use the building as a mooring site was safety. It mentions in paragraph @NUM1 that the German dirigible, the Hindenburg, was destroyed by a fire in New Jersey. This brought on thoughts about it happening at the Empire State Building. If a dirigible caught fire while attached to the building there would be a high death rate due to New York City being so populated. Another obstacle would have been keeping the dirigibles from swiveling around the mooring mast. In paragraph @NUM2 the point that having lead weights away down the back of the ship would be quite dangerous with so many pedestrians on the street below. Yet another reason why trying to more the dirigibles to the building was not practical was because of ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"" (paragraph @NUM3). This made it illegal for the ships to tie up to the building, let alone get close enough to try to. Tying all of these reasons together is the fact that the wind was too strong at the top of the building for anything to happen safely and without some sort of injury."	3	3		3																					
5252	6	"In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles. First, ""the lack of a suitable landing area"". They had to make room for the huge dirigibles to land. Second, ""add stress to the building's frame."" They had to make the structure of the building stronger so it wouldnt break. Lastly, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"" if they were going to be able to make this work they needed to find a way to calm the wind by the tower. Hence, In ""The Mooring Mask"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, in order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders of the Empire State Building had to face obstacles."	2	3		3																					
5255	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One important issue was the Mooring Mast. According to @ORGANIZATION2, ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" (paragraph @NUM1) Another problem would be the dirigible's load. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" (para. @NUM1) One of the main things the architects forgot to take into consideration was the buildings frame. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation.""(para. @NUM1) The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
5259	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building taste some obstacles in attempting to have a dirigible dock.  The dock would break the laws.  The dock would also be a danger to the people below.  It would also put a lot of stress to the frame of the building."""	1	1		1																					
5281	6	"The obstacles that needed to be overcame, to create the idea of a docking platform on top of what was going to be announced as ""The tallest building,"" was going to be tough. The steps taken to make this idea come to life, began with consulting with experts. They took tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the @ORGANIZATION1 in New Jersey. When it was time to start constructing, the issue of the stress the building would intake from the mass of the Dirigibles became a problem. They modified the buildings frame to accommodate the new situation. They also designed a stainless steel tower with a stepped back design that imitated the overall shape of the building. over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications were made to achieve the goal of ""The Mooring Mast"""	2	3		3																					
5284	6	The builders of the Empire state building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders had to be cautious about safety, which played a big role with the dirigibles. Many dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable they wouldn't want the city to be destroyed and at risk of a massive fire. Another problem was nature itself. There were violent air currents above the building and not be a danger to the local pedestrians of New York. The final obstacle builders faced when trying to pursue the dirigible idea was a law that prohibited airships flying too low over urban areas. They would be breaking the law to even allow it within the area of the building, with so many issues occurring in the development of the dirigible plan, the idea of using them quietly disappeared.	3	3		3																					
5285	6	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced was. how to build the morring mast. how to atach the mooring mast to the frame of the Empire @CAPS1 Building.	1	1		1																					
5299	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. in the excerpt ""The Mooring Mask"" by @PERSON1. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building were all very competitive for the Building to be very tall and they did not have a very great plan that they used. They wanted the building to have a great top and wanted it to also be useful, so they wanted dirigibles to dock there They figured out after that it wasn't such a good idea when they looked into the history of how many accidents happened. If any accident happened in New York like that then it would be a very big deal because there are so many people that live there. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mask. They felt it would be unsafe for many reasons. This is the reason why the builders went through many obstacles"	2	2		2																					
5301	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast I have seen how the builders of the empire State building ran into obstacles trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The empire State building was already standing in the architects decided to renovate and make a dock for dirigibles. The architects working on this project had to strengthen the buildings frame. They also had to have wenches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring. The architects also needed to install housed elevators and stairs bring passengers down to the base floor and back up. After the renovations were done to be empire state building it had 102 floors. After the building was done the owners found out that they could not let dirigibles on to the building. They would break the law of airships flying to low in urban areas. So the empire state building was finished but you could not use it for dirigible's.	3	2		3																					
5302	6	Al Smith announced that the Empire State Building would reach the new height of 1,250 ft on December 11, 1929. His plan was to build a mooring mast, at the top of the building to make it equiped for modern travel. The bulders faced three main obstacles, when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle was safety. Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION2 used hydrogen, which is highly flamable. When Hindenburg was destroyed in a fire, the owners of the Empire State Building became worried that a much worse accident would occur in New York.The second and greatest obstacle was nature. The winds was at the top of the building constantly shifted, which would cause the back of the dirigible swivel around the mast. The only way to solve this problem was with lead weights. This was not practical or safe.The final obstacle was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for the dirigibles to tie up to the building.In conclusion, the three main obstacles that the builders faced were safety, nature, and the law.	3	3		3																					
5308	6	"In this project to construct a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, there were some problems. The idea of the mooring mast was to be able to dock dirigibles to the top of the Empire State Building + be able to have passengers get on + off the dirigible from + into the building. The big problem that it faced was the wind speeds that high up in the air. At nearly @NUM1 feet in the air the wind would be whiping around even a massive, steel, docked dirigible. When New York governor, Al Smith put forth ideas to construct this mast nobody realized untill after that it was a somewhat rediculous task. In paragraph @NUM2, it states, ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After it was ruled impossible, people started to realize that everyone was just caught up in the new modern travel idea to be down to reality."	2	1		2																					
5309	6	In the excerpt, it talks about making the empire state building the tallest in new york. It was the tallest building until archetectures built the chrysler building. The chrysler building stood 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the empire state building. So Al Smith realized he was gonna loose his tittle for having the tallest building. Then he came up with the idea of adding a top or a hat to the building.The idea Al Smith came up with was adding a landing spot for blimps or dirigibles. Al Smith knew it wasnt gonna be easy so he thought of possible reasons why it wouldnt work. He had to design another figure that would be able to hold the mass of the blimps. He also had to think about how passangers would get on and off the blimp. He also remembered most blimps use hydrogen instead of hellium which hydrogen is highly flammable. For example the German blimp hindenburg was destroyed by fire in lake hurst.	2	2		2																					
5318	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that countries other than the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flamable, if it caught fire above a city, the results would be diasastrous. Another obstacle was that at such a hieght,  the winds would blow the back of the dirigible around. Perhaps the most obvious obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building was the law that airships could not fly below a certain hieght over cities. All of these obstacles combined to make the project impractical and impossible	3	3		3																					
5324	6	"Dirigibles, or blimps, were seen as the transportation of the future. In order to add height and yet serve a purpose, architects of the Empire state Building decided to build a mooring mast upon the building to accommodate ""aviation pioneers."" @CAPS1 the mast was built and gave the building its desired height, the usage of it as a docking station for dirigibles would never be fulfilled. The obstacles that builders had in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock included the height of the building, wind speeds, and the safety of civilians. The height of the building was 1,250 feet, thus having violent shifts in air currents. ""The wind s on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dirigibles also used hydrogen for fuel and lead weights to be weighed down; however, by using the mast, hydrogen and the use of lead weights provided a safety hazard to civilians below. Builders had created the mooring mast to dock dirigibles, but the idea caused problems and was never fulfilled."	2	2		2																					
5325	6	"The builders of the empire state building attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there was a fuetle effort. The tried a numerous amount of different ways to approach this idea. There were a few different theorie's on what would be best, and how to develope the Mooring Mast by Al Smith and John Tauranac. Each man had a different thought on how the whole structure would turn out. The architects designed a new glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that ranged from the bottom to the top of the empire state Building. This structure helped support the mooring are, where the dirigibles were docked. But the fate of the Mast was not to bright. ""The Mooring Mast of the Empire state building was Never destined to fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" This statement is utterly true. And shows the work of the architects was never fully planned and over looked for the Mast to be durable."	1	0		1																					
5326	6	Based on the excerpt the obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in atteptin to allow dirigible to dock there were the fallowings. One obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. The greater obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The dirigible couldn't do anything even if tethered it to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast.	2	2		2																					
5330	6	"Many obstacles were faced by the builders of the Empire State Building as stated in the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2. These obstacles included safety and availability. The idea of being able to dock a dirigible to a building in the middle of a densely populated city such as New York was extremely unsafe between the explosive tendencies of Hydrogen and the unmanageable winds. With the winds the dirigible would continuesly move around the mast creating an extremely unsafe environment for all. Availability would also be put into question, in paragraph fifteen @ORGANIZATION2 tells about the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles @CAPS1 to dock due to the unavailable route of save entirence. This unavailability made traveling to the mooring mast almost impossible. The obstacles in the mooring mast include availability and safety."	3	2		3																					
5332	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a number of different obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there, the most difficult of which were the urban location, money, and the weather. The urban location was an obstacle for the builders because there are laws against airships flying too low over a density populated area and you can't weight the airship down like you could if it was on the ground because the weights would be dangling over the city. The second obstacle was money because it was becoming increasingly expensive to pay for all of the modifications to make the mooring mast the reality. The third and most dangerous obstacle was the weather because wind and other various kinds of storms can control the airship and make it difficult for it to dock at the Empire State Building. Therefore, the obstacles of the urban location, money, and the weather made it virtually impossible for the mooring mast to be constructed.	3	3		3																					
5333	6	The dirigibles were not able to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building for obvious reasons. When the construction workers were building the mast, they didn't realize how dangerous it was having a dirigible landing on the top of the building. There were a few cautions that the workers realized. First off, if the dirigible catches on fire like the one in Lakehurst, New Jersey, then a lot of people would be at risk because it is such a big city with massive amounts of people. Another reason they realized after was that it was too dangerous for the dirigible to land there due to the high swirling winds. If they tried landing there, but the violent winds wouldn't let them, then it would not be the least bit safe. This is how the workers of the Empire State building faced obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there.	2	2		2																					
5334	6	"There Are @CAPS1 things that Are worry Some About dirigibles docking there. One of them was the fact that ""The dirigibles would sway in the wind As the passengers walked down A Gangplank"". This would be unsafe because As it sways, it could knock the passengers off the plank and cause them to fall."	2	0		1																					
5337	6	"The main obstacle in allowing dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building's Mooring Mast was safety. ""Most dirigibles... used hydrogen... and hydrogen is highly flammable."" ""The owners... realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above downtown New York."" If an accident were to happen with a dirigible it would be putting hundreds of people's lives at risk. That is why this idea was unpractical and unsafe.Another obstacle in allowing dirigibles to moor at the Empire State Building's mast was nature itself. ""The winds on top were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This would cause the back of the ship to swivel around the mast. Lead weights could be used, but that was neither practical nor safe where they would be dangling high above pedestrians."	3	3		3																					
5343	6	The obstacles of getting the dirigibles to be able to dock at the empire state building was, they couldn't put the fuell on top of the building. Putting mooring mast on top of the roof would make it very unstable and putt a lot of Pressure on it. For this to happen they had to modify the structure of the roof, which ended up costing over @MONEY1. After succefully building that they had another obstacle. It was trying to figure out how the dirigibles wouldn't move around with so much wind currents. They never figured out how and the idea just disappeared.	1	2		2																					
5344	6	"From the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attenting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the designing as well as the cost of this project could encounter problems. Such as, ""add stress to the building's frame."" If the mass interfered with the frame of the building, then changing the material of the building could cost ""over sixty thousand dollars!"" In addition, safety was a major component when trying to construct the mooring mast. For example, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen...and hydrogen is highly flammable."" New York is a very populated area, which means when building a mooring mast, safety must be considered into perspective. Lastly, their were restrictions on airships flying too close to cities. As it states in the excerpt, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" Overall, when constructing the mooring mast, many builders were blind to the potential problems, making the project unsuccessful."	3	3		3																					
5345	6	One of the obstacles they faced were the strong winds. Because of the violent air currents the winds were constantly shifting. The dirigible would constantly be moving around. They couldn't even weigh it down, because there would be people far below them, and they could fall. A second obstacle they faced were the laws against it. There were existing laws about airships flying too low over the city. It was illegal for the airships to even come into the city.           Those two obstacles stop them using the dock for dirigibles.	3	3		2																					
5346	6	"Based on the article ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there were, the strong wind currents, the fact that dirigibles were very flammable, and that they were very large and hard to keep still. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that the use of hydrogen rather than helium should have stopped the project. Also in paragraph @NUM2 it states that the biggest obstacle was nature itself. For the reasons above those are some of the obstacles builders faced in attempting to have dirigibles dock there."	2	2		2																					
5349	6	In the excerpt the @CAPS1 were faced with multiple issues on their theory. It took lots of time for people to begin realizing reality. For example, Airships had a law preventing them from getting to low to urban areas. Also they realized major would play a negative role. Wind would cause the @CAPS2 to swing around all Docked. They thought to way down the rear of the ship, but soon realized that is unsafe over many people below. They had heard of a @CAPS2 in New Jersey was Destroyed by fire, Due to its hydrogen, Also unsafe in New York with such a @ORGANIZATION1 population. Overall they began to realize saftey issues and how unpractical it was to do all of this.	3	3		3																					
5350	6	"The idea of allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State building was unrealistic because there was a lack of identification of possible flaws in this plan. As a new form of transportation, dirigbles were not safe. This was proven true when the German dirigble, ""Hindenburg"", exploded in 1937. In addition, a more significant obstacle that was not adressed when the plan was created was the problem with its location. In the crowded streets of New York City, suspending flamable dirigibles above population is unsafe. This location is also an obstacle because of the equipment needed to land the dirigible: lead weights. The use of lead weights to way down the dirigibles is unimaginable with the possible dangerous situations it could create. The creators of this idea solely designed this system on top of the Empire State building to incorporate a futuristic form of transportation to make the building more unique. The Empire State building builders and encountered many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock their because the concept was far past the capabilities of their age."	2	2		2																					
5351	6	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced are dirigibles use hydrogen to float. Hydrogen is a highly flammable gas and if it was ignited it was cause a lot of property damage. Also at 1,250 ft there is a lot of wind. The dirigible would blow around the building causing unnatural stress to the building. It would be very difficult to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	1	2		2																					
5352	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.In designing the mast, the steel frame of the State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new siteation, @MONEY1' worth of modifications were made to the buildings framework, Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself.The mooring mast failed. Most dirigibles from outside of the @ORGANIZATION2 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable. Weather, such as violent air currents, were the greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mast.	3	3		3																					
5354	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock. For example the building had to be reframed because its original frame could not support the weight of a dirigible on top it. Also the materials inside dirigibles are highly flammable so an accident above an urban area thats highly popuated would have been costly/fatal. Another obstacle was the wind, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents the dirigible would be swiveling around and unstable, thus making the idea for docking dirigibles on top of the empire state building unpractical and unsafe.	3	3		3																					
5363	6	The builders of the Empire State building faced many challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was that putting the mast on the empire state building then having a giant dirigible moor on to it would cause stress on the building and could pull the mast right off causing it to weigh the dirigible down to the people and buildings it could cause death and destruction. Another obstacle was timing the construction right. They dont want the mast to be done when the whole building is only on floor @NUM1 out of 102.	1	2		2																					
5365	6	Based on the excerpt, The Mooring Mast, the building of the Empire State Building had many obstacles the builders had to overcome. Some practical obstacles in building this landmark was the law against airships flying low, the complete dirigible mooring equipment wasn't installed, and greatest obstacle of all was nature surrounding the Empire State Building.The first obstacle builders had to overcome is the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The problem with flying too low is the dirigibles couldn't even try to attempt to reach the building. In December 1930, one dirigable approached the mast, but couldn't get close enough fearing the forceful winds would cause it to run into the sharp spires. As if that wasn't a problem, the dirigible mooring equipment wasn't even installed which meant the newspapers being delivered would have to be caught by dangling ropes from the dirigable, which could get tiring. The greatest obstacle of all was nature. Winds at the top of the building were really strong due to the violent wind currents, which could cause the dirigable to keep moving, even when tied up to the mast.Overall, the nature of weather was the huge obstacle.	3	3		3																					
5369	6	Obstacles the builders had to try and over come were the extra preshure on the frame of the @CAPS1 and the diffuclt docking process also the high speed winds that made it basicly impossiBle to do.	1	1		1																					
5374	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles as an attempt to allow dirigible to dock there.  In paragraph @NUM1 it shows an obstacle the builders spaced.  ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself.""  This is because the wind.  The wind would shift due to violent air currents."	1	1		1																					
5375	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. When it says in the passage, ""could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof,"" this means that the architects would have to modify and strengthen the building for a ""thousand-foot dirigible"" to land there. Over @MONEY1 of changes had to be made for this. Safety was another problem. Dirigibles from other countries used hydrogen instead of helium. Because hydrogen is highly flammable, downtown New York could have been destroyed by a large fire if a dirigible caught fire there. Nature itself was also a problem. ""Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This would cause the dirigible to swivel around, which would be dangerous. The architects came in contact with many problems."	3	3		3																					
5376	6	The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirt dribbles to dock there was, if they dropped the mooring mast on the top of the building they would have strengthened the frame because of the wind pressure, and pressure from the single cable. Also most dirigibles from out of state were highly flammable because they used hydrogen rather than helium. Another problem was that New York is a highly populated city and they did not want to take the risk of having something fall from the top of the building on to citizens down below. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature. The violent winds were constantly shifting due to the violent currents. Even if that could get the dirigibles tied down the back would be flying around. They also suggest using lead weights to hold it down, but if they fell the pedestrians on the street would be in great danger. The last obstacle faced with the fact that there was a law about airships flying to low over urban areas.	3	3		3																					
5378	6	"While builders attempted to create a landing area for dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, they ran into many problems. Al @CAPS1 idea sounded unrealistic but with enough motivation they were set on trying to make it happen. After so much renovation, work, and ideas they had finally realized all the potential problems.What's being built all the problems became apparent. The main reason they never used the dock is because they realized it could possibly catch fire, like it had in New Jersey... ""The owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area..."". Also they warned about the intense winds on top of the tower. They feared it would continuously blow around the dirigible without a way to weigh it down. Another reason is it is against the law to fly airships to low over urban areas. The builders faced many obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
5380	6	"Many of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were issues that should have been thought about before construction began. At such a height their whirlwind issues that could push the derigible in undesired directions. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air current."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1). After the Hindenburg exploded the concerns for the same thing happening was a large safety concern. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2 Line 6)"	2	2		2																					
5383	6	"From the story the Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders faced huge problems when they tried to make it accessable for dirigibles to land. One major factor was the winds at such high altitude, ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders not only had to think of a way for the ships to be secure and not low around, but also needed a way to support the weight of the dirigible because of the already heavy building. These are only some of the great problems the builders needed to deal with."	2	2		2																					
5384	6	"After reading the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, it easy to see that this project faces numerous obstacles to overcome. The builders of the Empire State Building have a lot on their plate in order to allow dirigibles to dock their. For example, the builders have to modify and strengthen the @ORGANIZATION1 frame and also construct a mast to which dirigibles could dock.If there was to be ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,... (@NUM1) it would add an enormous amount of stress to the entire building This is why the steel frame of the Empire State Building has to be strengthened, and ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@NUM1). The builders of the Empire State Building also have to construct a mast for the dirigibles. In the end, ""...the architects who designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a step-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself"" (@NUM3). This idea of adding a mast for dirigibles to the Empire State Building creates much work for the builders.This excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 easily illustrates the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building have to overcome. From modifying the frame to constructing the mast, these builders sure do you have a greatly increased workload."	2	2		2																					
5392	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, because they had to come up with a way for a mooring mast to land on the Building's roof, because a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable can add stress to the building's frame. The Building's frame would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate the situation. That wasnt the only obstacles money was one of the problems as well, ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework."" That's a lot of money that is being used just for a frame of a building. Safety was an obstacle as well, ""The greatest  rason was one of safety Most dirigibles from outside the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" I think safety was the greatest obstacles they had, because what if a hydrogen dirigible was to blow up on top of the Empire Building. think of all the people that could get hurt because they dont call New York the city that never sleeps because people stay up at night in there house. They call it the city that never sleep's because it's alway's moving, there's alway's people on the streets and downtown New York is alway's full of people."	2	3		3

5412	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a couple of obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles the builders had was with the stress of the dirigibles load as said in the excerpt in paragraph @NUM1.             Another obstacle they had with landing the dirigibles to dock was that they had to modify and strengthened the steel frame of the Empire State Building. They needed to do that so it can accommodate this new situation, which is to get dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
5418	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, it describes many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building had to face in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first obstacle they had to face was the constant change in nature and how it could affect the dirigibles. The dirigibles would ""swivel around"" because of the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" This could put pedestrians on the street in danger because the ship is on top moving and could be unstable. Another obstacle is safety. Outside the United States the dirigibles ""used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" Other countries ships could set on fire in the United States and put people in danger. Also the fact that the loading dock was more than 1,250 feet and loading off could be unstable because of the winds. The last obstacle faced was the ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas"". Therefore it was illegal to get the dirigibles close enough to the buildings safely. All these obstacles faced made the workers and planners realize this idea could not be achieved without harming anyone or putting people in danger."	3	3		3																					
5432	6	The empire State building builders faced a couple of Problems of docking dirigibles to the mooring mast. Some, I don't even know, @CAPS5 I'll just buildup from here & @CAPS1 what @NUM1. The dirigible. Now I never learned about the @CAPS2 of a zeppelin, but I do know one thing. Do @CAPS7 get out from the front, or sides? I @NUM2. The mast itself. This thing was a failure from the @CAPS3. (don't question why I chose Something else for one of the multi-@CAPS4 questions). The reason why is that @CAPS5 many things could go wrong. This thing can @ORGANIZATION1, & @CAPS6 fall off unless @CAPS7 do something really special for forging a building this high.Overall, it's been a long while, anyways these problems, & Several others that I forgot to mention for obvious reasons are @CAPS6 the reason why we don't use  zeppelins as much anymore...	1	0		1																					
5436	6	There were plenty of obstacles the builder faced it trying to allow the dirigibles to dock here are some. First having something this big land on a @NUM1 foot building would add lots of stress to the buildings frame. All of this stress have to be distributed throughout the eleven hundred foot building which was unthoughtof. In order to make the building suitable for all this weight it would cost over sixty thousand dollars and that was alot concidering every thing elsethat they were doing. Those were @CAPS1 a few obstacles they had trying to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the empire state building.	2	2		2																					
5442	6	"Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building created many obstacles for its builders. Some of which weren't even discovered until finally attempting to do it.The first of the builders problems started with trying to prepare the actual building for the added stress that would be applied when having dirigibles try to dock. They spent @MONEY1 on modifications to reinforce the framework of the building. Then ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower..."" This created lots of unnecessary work for the workers, as well as made obstacles.There was also a lot of danger associated with docking dirigibles that the builders had to deal with. The violent changing air currents would require them to make the mast as sturdy as possible and account for the movement of the dirigibles. Finally the builders find out the biggest obstacle which is that it is legal for airships to fly that low over urban areas, so technically they weren't even allowed to do what they did. Thinking back on it, it is obvious to see that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose..."""	3	3		3																					
5446	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First the building had a flat roof and a dirigible moored to the top, only held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame. Modifications to the building would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Other problems the building faced had to do with safety. Some dirigibles used hydrogen which is highly flammable and if an accident were to happen in New York it would be disastrous. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. The winds were constantly shifting and even tethered to the mooring mast, the ship would not be secured. This was also very unsafe. The Empire State Building never succeeded it's purpose."	3	3		3																					
5450	6	"Builders faced many obstacles such as safety, nature, flammability and law in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the mast. The first problem is ""the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill it's purpose."" The dirigibles also, use hydrogen not helium, which is very flammable. The Hindenburg, a German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey and, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse [it] could have been if it [happened] over densely populated area such as New York. The violent air currents also played a role, the back of the ship would swivel around and around. When dirigibles moored in landing fields they would be weighted down with lead weights, which would be dangerous for pedestrians on the street. Also, there was a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. There was no way dirigibles would be able to dock at the mast"	3	3		3																					
5451	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building in New York faced many obstacles while attempting to allowed dirigibles to dock. One obstacle of the builders was creating the Empire State Building with the strength to hold the dirigible, swaying in the wind, without the building falling over. The weight of the dirigible would have to be transferred to the bottom of the building which was almost eleven hundred feet below. The largest obstacle, however, was holding the dirigible in place while it was docked atop the building. The winds were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" and would make the dirigible fly wildly around the top of the building (@CAPS1 paragraph @NUM1). The building would never be used for its transportational all purpose because of the dangers and obstacles of the mooring mast and dirigibles."	3	2		3																					
5452	6	While designing and building the mooring mast atop the Empire State building, the engineers seem to have ignored some seemingly useful information. As with any vehicle in the air or at sea, wind is either your enemy, or your friend. The engineers should have taken into greater consideration that changing wind speeds and direction 1,250 feet in the air are huge threats. Your dirigible will have a hard time getting close enough to the mast to moor, never mind to stay steady enough for passengers to exit, and board safely. Also if the law itsself prevented you from floating your blimp at such low altitudes, then its game over. Why even bother if its illegal? Although it seems like a futuristic sci-fi, and not to mention downright cool way to land a blimp, to many things prevented the idea from prevailing.	2	2		2																					
5453	6	There were many obstacles that the Empire State buildings owner faced. One obstacle was not having enough room for the dirigible to land. To help solve this problem, the architect added mooring mast to increase the buildings height. Another obstacle was that the steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be expanded in order for there to be more height added to the building. Altogether this would cost over @MONEY1. The main reason, and obstacle was safety. The owner had to make sure that the dirigible was not flammable, in which it was. Wind and nature also played a big part in deciding to go through with the idea. The strong winds would make the dirigible swing and constantly shift. This would make the dirigible hang over people on the streets of New York, which was not safe. The idea that landing dirigibles on top of the empire state building was neither safe or practical, and there were just too many struggles and obstacles for a plan like this to ever follow through.	3	3		3																					
5455	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibels to dock there. The main reason the diriibles couldn't dock there was because the dirigbles load. The load would cause stress. The wind pressure also is another reason dirigbles couldn't dock there. ""The wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The dirigbles were docked by means of an electric winch. The electric winch was fine but, it also says ""the dirigible could swing in the breeze"" this could have been a safety concern also."	2	3		3																					
5459	6	Architects had to face many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire State building. The very first problem architects faced was adding a mooring mast to the building because they could not Simply just drop one on, they had to go back and re-support the whole skeleton of the building. Another problem is if the dirigible were to fail like the hindenburg it would plument in a ball of fire to a very populated city down below. The greatest problems architects had to face was nature itself There were violent winds constantly if a dirigible had been tethered down it would move violently and go @CAPS1 down on pedestrians down below, which is too much of a risk for the architects to take.	3	2		3																					
5466	6	The obstacles that the builders of the empire State building was really difficult. The worker had to make sure that the building was'nt so tall that it would so tilt. The workers also faced competition They needed there building to be the biggest and they didn't give up until there building was in fooy the tallest building in @CAPS1.	0	0		0																					
5468	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, new friends would have to include more money. Anything done so top of a building so large would have to be balanced by strengthening the foundation. According to paragraph @NUM1, ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another large obstacle the builders would have to deal with was finding a way to neutralize the violent wind currents atop the @DATE1 ft. building. Even if the front of the dirigible was anchored to the mooring, the back would be left to sway in the wind, Any accident or damage done to a dirigible over such a highly populated area such as downtown New York would have devastating results. In conclusion, the risks of allowing dirigibles to dock atop the Empire State Building outweighed the rewards. When dirigible travel became less practical, the plan was scrapped completely."	3	2		3																					
5470	6	"Problems the builders of the Empire State Building cam across were some tricky, life threatening ones. The first being as mentioned in paragraph @NUM1. When it explains that if a dirigible was to try and dock and something went wrong and it caught on fire, their would be serious damage done to the people below on the streets. Another obstacle the builders had to deal with was the ""greatest obstacle"" in paragraph @NUM2. the fact that the wind a top of the tower would be whipping the dirigible around with just a cable holding it to the mooring mast. Not making it safe for anyone around the building or in the blimp. One other reason the builders had to figure out when building the mast, was that no airships flying low could enter the area as mentioned in paragraph @NUM3. Those are some of the problems the builders had to face if they wished to dock dirigibles on the building."	3	3		3																					
5474	6	The architects had few problems. As said in @LOCATION1, stress from the Dirigibles Load was too much for The building. They would @CAPS1 over sixty thousand Dollars of modifications. Other Then That They @CAPS2 had to redesign And then make it.	1	2		2																					
5483	6	In the excerpt, The Mooring @CAPS1 by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building had a hard task on their hands. They were building the tallest building in the world and when Al Smith, the head in the construction of the building, said to make it taller things got even more difficult. Mainly because they wanted this newfound height to be used as a dock for dirigibles. What they didn't know is that it is a little more difficult than just tying up a blimp to a building. They had many obstacles at hand. The architects would have to modify the building because a thousand-foot dirigible moored on the building would add stress to the building. Dirigibles used hydrogen which is extremely flamable, if it were to catch on fire in downtown New York it would be desasterous. Nature poses a threat as well, the winds on  top of the building would cause the dirigible to swivle around. The final obstacle is there is a law that prohibits airships to fly to low in urban areas. In the end the plan failed.	3	3		3																					
5493	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"", it is clear the architects were blind to the problems of the mast. Al Smith was becoming competitive to build the tallest building, and that was blinding him to potential risks. The people wanted to progress transportation of their time had not fully analized the future complications. In designing the mast, paragraph nine quotes, ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of a building... would add stress to the building's frame"". Even in early progression of the mast, it was clear this may not work. Two months later the building was reframed and the mast was added. May 6, 1937, owers of the building realized that if an accident like the destruction of 'Hindenburg' occurred atop the building, it would be devastation to happen above the densly populated Downtown New York (paragraph @NUM1). Another obstacle, as said in paragraph @NUM2, is nature itself. Winds at such high elevations were often unpredictable and would be extremely dangerous to have a tethered dirigible to swivel around and around the mast. Therefore the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building never fufilled it's destiny, but is now a site tourists flock to. By the end of the 1930's, the idea of dirigibles as future transportation was replaced by airplanes."	3	3		3																					
5496	6	The builders didn't have a suitable landing area for the Dirigible, and if the Dirigible were to land on the Empire State Building's flat roof would add stress to the building. Money was one of the big issues the builders faced. In paragraph @NUM1 its saying that the greatest obstact was nature, The heavy winds on top of the building were shifting due to the violent air current. for the Dirigible itself would be swivel around the mooring mast, and for the safety of the people as well. Another obsticle was the law, that flying too low over urban areas were not allowed.	3	2		3																					
5498	6	In constructing and building the empire State building to make it allowable for dirigables to dock there took alot of thinking on the builders' part. First they had to see what the building could handle and try to calculate what it held so it wouldn't fall. Then they had to figure out the safety of the passengers and pedestrians, a way to get in and out as safe and easy as possible. Despite all the work the builders' put into crafting Al Smith's idea, the chances just weren't realistic at all to the public and the plan had to be shut down. Although it makes a good story and is a crutial learning block for constructers to be.	1	1		1																					
5499	6	"Based on the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the first problems they faced was not being able to land. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the lack of suitable landing area."" (@CAPS1 6). This was a major problem because they had nowhere to land this object; this cannot modernize their traveling.Another problem that the builders faced was safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This caused a problem because how were dirigibles from other countries visit us if they caused a threat to the safety of the people. They were not going to take that risk.A third problem was nature and the weather. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) The blimps had a very unsteady landing The winds would thrash them around. This was very unsafe @CAPS5 thats why it became an obsticale for the builders."	3	3		3																					
5500	6	The obstacles that builders faced at the empire State Building in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there are. The possible dangers of having something fall on them. The hydrogen is highley flamable so the dirigible could blow up and ingor any one aroud it. The empire state building may not be strong enough to withstand the the moving of the @CAPS1 the back side moveing so much from the dangorouse winds, so the @CAPS1 could possibly pull off part of the building and could @CAPS2 nearby pedastrians.	2	1		2																					
5504	6	Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. The main problem was safety. When the front was masted to the building the back would move around. Another big problem was that the dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. Also, it was illegal for airships to fly that low over urban areas. Another obstacle was that the dirigible could not get close enough to the building because of wind.	3	2		3																					
5509	6	"During the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. Often times something is predicted to work out a whole lot easier than it actually does, which is exactly what happened in this situation. As stated in the excerpt ""the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" For the builders, this was quite a project and took an extreme amount of time and effort. Also, the builders eventually realized that there were huge safety issues with this new design. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. This was a huge obstacle that stood in the way of their plan. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Shifting winds due to violent air currents were also a huge issue. All of these things contributed to the mooring mast not ever becoming successful."	3	3		3																					
5511	6	The obstacles of the builders of the Empire State Building faced were hard because they couldn't just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building do to the frame work Also the stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. Which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would also have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. And over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications have to be made to the building's framework The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from sides, with a steps-back design that imitated over all shape of the building itself capital rocket-shape mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny-aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm.	1	2		2																					
5513	6	"The problems the builders had in attempting to build the Empire State Building were first of all, the dirigible would have to be tied to the mast and the single cable tether would ""stress the buildings frame."" In paragraph @NUM1, the author says that the wind pressure and the weight of the dirigible could not be supported by the current foundation and so the frame would have to be made stronger and changed. The final problem was when ""Columbia"" delivered newspaper to the Empire State building. The mooring equipment was not installed because of previous problems with the design, laws and common sense used when making this building. The rest of the problems had to do with the obliviousness of reality due to the actual effectivness of the building."	2	2		2																					
5515	6	"The @CAPS1 who made the Mooring mast faced many obstacals when trying to get dirigibles to dock. Some were safty, nature its self, and pre existing laws. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The greatest obstacal was nature. Winds at the top were always changing and could make the dirigibles crash to the mast. An existing law prevented airships to fly too low in urban cities. For all the work the @CAPS1 put into the mast it could never live up to its potential."	1	2		2																					
5522	6	"The excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2 is a story that takes the reader through the obstacles and attempts builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building. Al Smith, four-term governor of New York, planned to construct the Empire State Building after he was in office.Smith was competitive and realized that the building was close to earning the title of world's tallest building. So in 1929 he announced that the building would be 1,250 feet and he would do this by adding a top or hat to the building which would be distinctive. The idea was to add a mooring mass and observation decks to the top and have it be able to dock dirigibles, or blimps. Architects later realized that a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by one cable tether would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of a dirigible's load with the pressure of wind would go all the way to the building's foundation. The plans that have builders working so hard on frame work and observation decks failed. It was not practical to dock a dirigible, it wouldn't be safe. By the late 1930s, the idea was given up on, but the Empire State Building is still open to one of the observation decks and is a very popular attraction in New York."	2	1		2																					
5530	6	"Based on the article The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as the lack of landing area, being practical, and ensuring safety. The lack of landing area was of the the challenges. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Since no dirigible could land on the Empire State Building without some fish and landing space this was a challenge the builders of the building faced. Another challenge was making the dock practical, ""one set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement.."". This shows that a practical arrangement of the talking has yet been made, and therefore it was another challenge the builders faced. Lastly, the builders of the Empire State Building faced safety issues, "".... are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast""-this informs that the safety of docking dirigibles has not been unsured yet, that it was still a challenge the builders faced area altogether, the builders of the Empire State Building faced challenges such as the lack of landing areas, being practical, and ensuring safety."	2	4		2																					
5537	6	In the excerpt the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. The builders did not think of what would happen to the dirigibles if something went wrong. Also on how tall they are makeing the empire state building.The first obstacle the builder faced in building the empire state building was what if something happened to the dirigibles. For example what if the dirigibles are highly flamible like the Hindenburg. The second obsticle the builders faced was on how tall they made it because of how tall it was the wind current was very strong.In the excerpt the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles. They tried to over come them but there were to many.	2	2		2

Even if the dirigibles successfully docked at the top of the building the back end of it would be thrashing around from the wind. If this happened and the blimp became uncontrollable it could crash into another building and fall to the ground where all the downtown New @CAPS1 walk. Putting weights on the end of the blimp would help that situation but as @CAPS2 says, ""dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" Another issue the builders faced was the fact that dirigibles were highly flammable. They learned their lesson and got it into their heads that their idea might not be so good after when the German blimp, the Hindenburg, was destroyed. "	3	3		3																					
5544	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders of the empire state building had to deal with many obsticles while trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The author tells us the readers that dirigibles were actually enormous steelframed balloons. with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. While the builders were trying to droop a mooring mast on top of the empire state building's flat roof. In the excerpt tells us the reader that ""a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. All though the dirigible is as light as the air it could mess up the frame of the building. Another obsticle the buildors had to face was when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in @LOCATION1, New jersey on May 6, 1937. The owner of the empire state building realized how much worse it would have been the accident happened in New York such as a populated are as downtown. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"". Even though the empire state building didn't get to put moors on top of the building it still became the world's tallest building."	3	3		3																					
5549	6	"In a competition with architect building the Chrysler Building, Al Smith wanted to construct a taller building with a purpose. That purpose would be to dock dirigibles on a mooring mast. This seemed like a good idea, taking a mode of transportation very popular and new and allowing it to run in New York City. Then their were problems, in the beginning the architects knew that ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"". So, with the time thay had, they assumed that they fixed the problem, but when it was finished the architects knew that ""The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to fufil it's purpose..."" Most of the problems didn't arise from the building but the practicality of having a dirigible land in a big crowded city, such as the highly flamable hydrogen that fills most dirigibles or the closeness of the other buildings to the blimps could cause them to burn. Overall the idea was good in theory, but could never be excuted. Only two dirigibles ever docked their and it has never been used since"	3	3		3																					
5554	6	"The builders of the mooring mast plan the construction well, but did not consider the potential risks of the mast. One reason that the mast's fate was sealed was because of safety issues. Most dirigibles, or blimps, used hydrogen rather than helium. If one of these blimps were to fall from the sky, many people below would be killed. New York has many people that walk everywhere. The builders also needed to considered the violent winds at such a high altitude. These winds could blow the dirigibles around, making it difficult to keep them in one spot for passengers to board, and to refuel. The winds are constantly shifting. They could blow the blimps onto the spires on the Empire State Building, causing them to burst and fall to the ground below. Unfortunately, there is a law that prevents airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". I think that Al Smith was more focused on keeping his height record, more than the potential dangers of the mast."	3	3		3																					
5555	6	"In ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Empire State Building is familiar to many people throughout the world, but not many know that the original purpose of the mast was to serve as a landing spot for dirigibles, also known as blimps. Do to the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, they eventually shelved the idea. One of the obsticles the builders realized that if a forign dirigibles were to dock and have an accident with any heat or a spark, they would explode and fall to the ground, killing many men, women, and children, due to the chemicals that are used on forign dirigibles. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, another obsticle they faced violent winds, that would knock the dirigibles around.

5564	6	"@ORGANIZATION2's article ""The Mooring Mast"", explains the many problems with using the peak of the Empire State Building to dock dirigibles. First of all, dirigibles that travelled internationally were filled with Hydrogen, a very flammable gas. Having another Hindenburg-style disaster over New York City would be very dagerous. Also, the winds at the top of the spire are rapidly changing and unpredictable, making an approach dangerous. It would normally be okay for a blimp to land in a windy area, because lead weights could be fastened to ropes holding the blimp down. Without landing on the ground, such as just attaching to the spire, there was no way to weigh down the blimp to stabilize it. Finally, a law existed against airships flying too low over urban areas, making a docking at the Empire state illegal. Many practical reasons crushed the dream of having dirigibles dock at the Empire State."	3	3		3

If a dirigible docked there on one cable, extreme tension would be put on the building.  Also, if an international dirigible were to dock filled with very flammable hydrogen and catch fire, the results would be catostrophic.The task of actually docking would be a problem as well.  With such a high altitude, winds were very strong.  Nothing could prevent the dirigibles from swinging around the building.  In other situations, dirigibles would be weighted down with lead weights.  However, if these were to fall, they would land in the busy city streets of New York.  Lastly, there was a law against low flying air ships, completely dismissing the idea of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5568	6	In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. First, the wind was to fast for the builders at that altitude. This shows that they didn't want any dirigibles to fall on any stores below. Second, they didn't finish the building because the building couldn't hold all the weight that they wanted to put on top of it. Third, hydrogen is highly flammable and could catch on fire easily. In brief, there were many problems that made the Empire State Building a bad idea to dock a dirigible.	2	2		2																					
5572	6	"The first obstacle is being able to get the passengers on and off due to the height they are already at. Also as stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds."" @CAPS1 therefore the power of the wind is a huge obstacle. Another obstacle stated in paragraph @NUM1 ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to tie up to the building or even approach the area."" @CAPS1 the law was another obstacle they had to face."	3	3		3																					
5573	6	The architects who built the mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building had many problems with actually docking any dirigibles there. When they @CAPS1 building the idea of being able to dock blimps on the top of a building was revolutionary and ideal. But they had many issues with safety, weather and laws. One issue with safety was that the gas inside the dirigibles, hydrogen, is highly flammable. One accident could harm hundreds of people in New York's streets. The wind on top of the building was also very strong. Making it difficult for any blimp to get in close enough. the last difficulty  that the builders had was laws. There were certain laws not allowing air ships to fly too low over high populated urban areas. While their mooring mast seemed like a good idea to start out with, sadly it never got much use.	3	3		3																					
5579	6	"There were many obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the mast. One obstacle they faced was nature itself. It says in the exerpt that ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around."" This could have led to major accidents if the dirigibles were allowed to dock here. Another obstacle they faced was that these dirigibles could not fly to low over urban cities. It says in the excerpt that ""these was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" But before the idea was even dropped, two dirigibles attempted to reach the building. The first one could not reach the building because of forceful winds. The second airship attempted a stunt to drop off a bundle of news papers. They didn't have the right equipment so they had to have a worker catch the bundle of papers that were attached by a rope. These obstacles were very important to be construction of the mast because it's probably saved the lifes not only the aviators but the people that lived in urban cities below."	3	3		3																					
5583	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there because dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mass. Also the body of the dirigibles they could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off.	0	1		1																					
5593	6	"Being an architect and construction worker is one of the hardest jobs in the world, especially at an elevation of @NUM1 feet. Building the Empire State building was no easy task. An even more challenging task was building a mooring mast, a docking area for dirigibles, on top of the Empire State Building. Since the building had a flat roof, ""architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building."" Architects had to build an extension in the shape of a rocket jutting out from the flat roof. The Architects also realized that having a single cable at the top of the extension to hook onto the dirigible, would add tremendous stress to the building. They had to find a way to ease the stress to the building's foundation. Although the architects faced challenges they did overcome them and planned to put their ideas into action."	1	2		2																					
5594	6	In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the top of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles. One obstacle being to much stress on the buildings frame. The dirigible would somehow have to be connected to the frame, which was @NUM1 feet below. Another problem the builders faced was safty. The workers wanted to use hydrogen to keep the dirigibles afloat, but realized hydrogen is flamable. Other problems where nature and law. Nature's winds would complicate the dirigibles from staying still. Law stated that the dirigibles would be flying to low for urban areas. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems that led to a plan failed.	3	3		3																					
5595	6	The obstacles the builders had to go through to allow dirigibles to dock there was by a electrical winch. By tying it to the mast, The wind pressure. Need to be in a open field and weighed down in the back with lead wieghts. Try to tie the building but it was illiogal so they coun't do it. Because of the force ful winds the also couldn't tie it on to the building. The dirilage mooring equiment was never stalled in either. Dirilgables and their passengers had quietly dissappeared and didn't become transportantion instead had given away to airplanes.	2	1		2																					
5596	6	Some problems the designers faced, were the violent air currents that form in urban areas, this would be a problem because the dirigible would be tossed around due to it's light weight. Another problem, is the fact that it would be too dangerous to land a dirigible over a densely populated area like New York City.	1	1		1																					
5600	6	"From what seemed to be a very possible way to make the Empire State Building famous to relizing how hard it was going to be the builders of the Empire State Building faced several obsticals in allowing dirigibles to dock. These problems included added Stress to the buildings frame. Therefore the foundation would have to be motified and Strengthened to accomodate this added stress."" Not only did the builders have to worry about structural but the winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violet air currents"" After all of the obsticlas the builders finally realized that this ""dream"" was impossible to overcome"	2	2		2																					
5602	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that United States dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If the dirigible was ever destroyed by fire above a densely populated area like downtown New York the accident could be very dangerous. One of the grestest obstacle of using the mooring mast was nature itself. The author says ""The winds on top of building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Dangling lead weights to weigh it down over pedestrians on the streets was niether practical nor safe. The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION2 tells a few obstacles the builders had to face to allow dirigibles to dock the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
5605	6	"The three insurmountable obstacles that the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State building were all a matter of public safety. They should have reallized that ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen"" and that they were thus prone to exploding. In an urban city like New York, a thousand foot dirigible that would cover four blocks would cause immense casualties. Secondly, violent air currents cause the winds at the top of the Empire State Building to be constantly shifting. The mooring mast would not work in that environment unless the back of the dirigible were weighted down with lead weights. The lead weights ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [would be] neither practical nor safe"". Thirdly the importance of public safety from aircraft had already been reallized in the form of a law banning airships from flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Docking in an urban setting proved too dangerous to risk."	3	3		3																					
5607	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle the builders faced was finding a way to have a dirigible moored on top of the Empire State building without adding stress to the buildings frame. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame"" (L�sted). Another obstacle that was face was money. they needed to make more than sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications. ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (L�sted). The biggist obstacle the builders had to face was nature, the winds would shift the dirigible to much. ""The greatest obstacle to the success of the mooring mast was nature itself"" (L�sted). As you can see there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
5609	6	The builders faced many problems attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the empire state building.  First of all, tying a dirigible with one cable would add tremendous weight to the frame of the building.  In order for this to be possible, the steel frame of the Empire state building would have to be strengthened which would add an additional cost of @MONEY1.  After the mast was built, the Empire state building faced new problems as well.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen which was highly flammable.  After what happened to the Hindenburg, the architects knew that the results would have been much worse in a densely populated area such as New York City.  Another problem was that it was too risky to have a big dirigible hanging above pedestrians a few thousand feet in the air.  The law also hindered Al Smith's idea.  The law stated that airships were prohibited from flying too low over urban areas.  When the dirigible Los Angeles attempted a trial, builders found that the wind blew too high for the dirigible and they feared it would fly into nearby buildings.  The idea of dirigibles was soon forgotten and gave way to airplanes.	3	3		3																					
5613	6	"There were several obstacles to the success of the construction. Perhaps the main obstacle, the obstacle that nothing could be done about, was the wind itself. On paragraph @NUM1 it mentions how the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. These giant- balloon like machines would constantly swivel around the mooring mast even if they were tied down. The Hindenburg disaster in May 6, 1937 also proved how dangerous it would be to have blimps filled with highly flammable hydrogen gas over a densely populated area, like downtown New York. The project was also held back by existing laws about flight in an urban area. ""It was illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"" -says the author on paragraph @NUM2. Incoming blimps would simply be flying too low against law for this to work."	3	3		3																					
5631	6	"The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was dificult. The builder met with experts to better understand the way the dirigibles work. He also was told that architects couldn't put a mooring mast on top because of the buildings flat roof. Paragraph nine States a thousand-foot dirigible- held by a single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" The stress would then be passed all the way down to the buildings foundation, nearly eleven hundred feet below. The builder put over sixty thousand dollars' worth of changes into the building. After all that time and money he was told that the plan would have to fall through. The dirigibles greatest obstacle was the wind, if it moved in the air that could be a problem. Although this plan didnt work, its still 1,250 ft and taller than the Chrysler building."	3	3		3																					
5635	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" the builders faced many obstacles. The main issue that was not noticed till the end; was that it was an enormous safety problem. The builders wanted to make the mooring mast a docking point for dirigibles, blimps, and zeppelins from the country and from other countries, but other countries used hydrogen, rather than helium; and hydrogen is extremely flammable. A fire over a metropolis such as New York would be catastrophic! Also, dirigibles used large lead weights to weigh them down. Using them in a city dangling over pedestrians would be neither practical, nor safe."	2	2		2																					
5639	6	"In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders needed more support for the building's framework. They had to use over sixtey thousand dollars to buy correct modification. Lack of a suitable landing area. There are alot of obstacles for the dirigibles.The builders needed more support for the building's framework. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). They had to use over sixty thousand dollars to buy modifications for the stressed frame. ""Over sixty-thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para @NUM1). There was a lack of suitable landing area. ""The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (@ORGANIZATION2, para 6).In the story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, this is how the builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
5640	6	"In the excerpt from @ORGANIZATION2's The Mooring Mast, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in allowing dirigibles to dock there. For example, ""the lack of a suitable landing area."" Architects cannot just drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's roof. The building would have had an extreme amount of pressure on it. In addition, along with the pressure, the dirigibles would ""add stress to the building's frame."" The builders needed to modify and strengthen the steel frame of the Empire State Building. This also cost a great deal of money. Furthermore, ""the greatest reason was safety."" The slightest mistake in building the mast, could affect every person in the building. In order to allow dirigibles to dock there, the builders needed to be aware of all the citizens surrounding the building. All in all, these obstacles determined the fate of the mast."	3	2		3																					
5644	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there was that he realized that he was close to losing the title of world's tallest building, also Some of his opinions were proven wrong because of facts. Another obstacle was trying to accomplish everything he says he was going to do On time. He needed to react more realistic than what he was thinking Of doing. Most obstacles had to do with ""nature itself."" Such as the wind which would make it swivel around."	1	1		1																					
5647	6	"There were many obstacles facing the builders attempting to allow dirgibles to dock on the mast of the Empire State Building. One reason was that attaching a humongous blimp to the peak of the building would add excessive strain to it. Lusted explains: ""A thousand-foot dirgible moored at the top of the building... would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1, much revision to the structure's frame was needed. Another obstacle was nature. Wind currents would push the dirigible around and it would be very unsafe. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirgible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This would make it unsafe for passengers to get on or off the blimp. There was also a law in effect that prevented ""airships flying too low over urban areas."" These obstacles prevented the builders from safely devising a way to dock the dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
5648	6	Allowing dirigibles stock at the Empire State Building was never possible because of the obstacles that the architects faced. First, nature was against the builders. The strong winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting, which proved a hazard to dirigibles. Mooring dirigibles would lead weights was out of the question because they were a danger to pedestrians. Another obstacle was an already existing law that prohibited dirigibles from flying low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to dock at the Empire State Building. The final obstacle was that a dirigible could be accidentally ignited and fall on New York. The destruction of the Hindenburg made clear that it was not possible to have a dirigible dock at the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5649	6	"Architects for the Empire State Building faced many problems trying install the landing gear on the mooring mast. There were many safety issues to get around landing a dirigible or blimp on the building. People in a populated area such as New York City, is not the safest place to land a blimp, ""when the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as dowtown New York."" They could not take this risk. So, the competion for landing gear was called off. Another main cause was the wind current on top of the Empire State Building. It proved very difficult to keep a blimp level at high altitudes, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" This could potentially result in the blimp detaching and hitting other buildings. This is why landing blimps on the Empire State building would be dangerous and difficult."	3	3		3																					
5650	6	"In this excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, workers and builders try to make a docking area for Dirigibles (blimps). In the process in doing so they @CAPS1 many obstacles. First, obstacle was the lack of a suitable landing area. They really should've thought to make it bigger in the first place. Workers did work but was not enuff. The greatest obstacle was nature itself. If they were good builders and knew what they were doing and then they would know that wind up higher gets ruffer. Bacicaly should have thought things through a little more; lastly, was the law against airships flying to low over urban areas. Should have checked if there were ney laws which there was; Also, all that work for nothing. All these obstacles that the workers and builders @CAPS2 were things that could have been prevented, so money and time did not have went to waste."	3	2		3																					
5652	6	"The use of the mast on the empire state building for dirigibles faced many obstacles. Violent winds, the amount of structural support and anti low-flying aircraft laws made it impossible to use. The high winds would spin the back of the aircraft and therefore the entire dirigible around the spire, and the structural support of such was extremely risky. The main interfering point however was an, ""existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". These things inevitably lead to the mast not being put to use."	2	2		2																					
5655	6	"In ""The @CAPS1 Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

5658	6	"In the short story ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For example they needed a suitable landing area which they could not do very easily. They needed to put a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building, but the architects could not do that with no problem. It took a lot of work. The @CAPS1 says ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" @CAPS2 they had an idea to add to make it work, would add stress to the building and take it down. The wind pressure had a great deal on that also. The winds were making it hard to keep the Dirigibles stable. They wanted to add weights to hold it down but that wouldn't be good for the people below. The @CAPS1 says ""Could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. They faced way to many problems."	3	2		3																					
5660	6	The builders had many obstacles in their way to accomplish their Idea of docking dirigibles. One main problem was that most dirigibles around the world used hydrogen gas which is highly flammable which can make things very dangerous at such an altitude.                                                 The greatest obstacle to it's success was nature itself. The winds where the docking would occur were constantly shifting and this would make the stability of the dirigible very difficult with the back end stretching so far away from the tower. Another reason this wouldn't work was because of an already existing law against air ships flying so low over urban areas.	3	3		3																					
5661	6	"New technology, especially in aviation,requires work to be done, thus causing many obstacles to overcome. In order to make this mooring mast on the Empire State building a success, the builders would need to know how to keep the dirigible hooked to the building and able to set passengers on and off. A quote from the text supporting this would be ""A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on"". (6). But the passengers were not the only obstacle the builders had to surpass. The stress a dirigible would put on the building would be too great, meaning they also had to remodel the actual building. The text supports this with, ""the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" (@NUM1). Even with all these modifications, however, the mooring mast was doomed to failure for reasons the builders could not fix."	2	2		2																					
5670	6	"In the construction of the Empire State Building, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

In paragraph @NUM1 it @CAPS2 that ""Over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework"", @CAPS1 this was a costly project as well. The excerpt also @CAPS2 that there were problems with getting the dirigible to stay in place without moving. The dirigible would be in a very windy area, and there was only one chord attached to the building which would leave the back moving around all over the place."	3	2		3																					
5672	6	The builders of the Empire State Building where faced with some obstacles in order to allow dirigibles to dock there. Saftey was the main focus because New York is a densly populated area and many dirigibles where filled with highly flameable hydrogen.One problem was that the builders relized the dirigible would be hanging by a single cable teather wich would add stress to the frame so they would need to adjust the building and strengthen the the frame. This costed over sixty thousand dollars to adjust. After that was taken care of the builders still had other problems.Another problem the builders faced was that since the building was in a highly populated area many pedestrians walk, below where the dirigibles would be docked. The winds at the top would cause the dirigible to blow around and lead weights could not be used because of the dangers of them falling	3	3		3																					
5681	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that they had to make the Empire State Building taller. The builders added a mooring mast to the top of the building to allow dirigibles to anchor the for several hours for refueling or service, and to allow the passengers on or off the dirigible. The dirigibles were docked which meant that the electric winch, in which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied to the mast. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless tower that would be illuminated from the inside. The roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. Everything went as planned as the builders wanted tpo.	1	0		1																					
5682	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Such as there was a law preventing airships to fly too low over urban areas. Also they could not ancor down the back of the blimp, and due to the shifting winds that high it would not be safe for passangers to get on and off. The building also had to be rebuilt to be able to come close to staying stable with the dirigible attached. And last was the differences In gases used to keep the blimps afloat. most dirigibles from outside of the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen is highly flamable making in very unsafe. These are some of the obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced to allow dirigibles to dock there.	3	3		3																					
5684	6	The dirigibles had @NUM1 obstacles to face, They had posidletys of fire, poping, and law troudle. They feared the dirigible would get on fire for it has hydrogen, that is rather highly flammable. They do not want to relate to the acsident that happened in lakehurst, New Jersey in May 6, 1937. also withe the fear of pops rase more concens. for the wind might blow it of chores into another building with a sharpe top that could possibley puncher the baloon. The feared this happening in downtown New York were it is highly populated. another reson prodley the biggest was that Empire State Building wanted a law for air crafts flying low over urban areas, so that ment there was no chance they could do what they were planing on doing.	2	3		3

5690	6	Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were That architects cannot simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. They would also have modifie and strengthened the steel frame of the Empire State uilding and all this was going to be worth sixty thousand dollars of modifications. Theese engineers had to try to dope out a Practical workable arrangement and also the government People in washington were figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to the mast. This idea of doing this was neither practical nor safe because all this things would be dang ling high above Pedestrians on the street. This could have never happened either because there was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas.

5692	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" it shows that it was not easy making the dirigibles a safe docking station.A struggle that was faced during this time was that dirigibles from other countries were made with hydrogen which is highly flammable. This meant that if it was exposed to fire it would instantly catch on fire over the world's most populated city.Another problem that was faced with the amount of wind at the top of the Empire building. With all this wind it was hard for pilots of dirigibles to steer.

They also had to account for the weather and how it may have affected the blimps.      The builders had to add on more floors to the building and strengthen it's base so that the mast could work properly and stay stable. then they ruled out using weights to anchor the blimps in place because the people on the street below. Also the chemicals in the blimp were highly flamable and put people around at risk. Sometimes the winds were too strong for the blimps to get close enough without being punctured. The builders were faced with impossible obstacles to overcome	3	3		3																					
5700	6	Based on the excerpt, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a huge challenge for them to face. For example, mother nature itself was one of they're huge challenges they would mostly face. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were constantly shifting and shifting due to violent air currents. As soon as an dirigible would hook up to the building, workers would have to find a way to keep they're airship from crashing into the building from the rusty winds at the top of the building. Therefore, if a dirigible- crashed anywhere on the ground it would burst into an inferno because the inside of a dirigible is filled with hydrogen and helium, so if it did crashed it will involve heat and fire that would be coming from the sparks it prevents as it crashes on the ground.	2	2		2																					
5703	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building was nature itself.	1	1		1																					
5704	6	During construction of the mooring mast atop the Empire State Building, the builders @CAPS1 many challenges. If they had just put a spire on top of the building. the weight of a dirigible could destroy it. The construction team needed to go back and reinforce the entire framework of the building. other obstacles in their way included low-flying aircraft laws, difficult weather conditions, and safety (if the derigible crashed over New York). For all these reasons the mooring mast was doomed from the start.	2	2		2																					
5706	6	The @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the high winds and the building struggled to stay up. The builders had difficulty getting the building to how they want it. They kept adding to the building and making it taller. The dirigibles needed it to be bigger so they could see it. The problem was that it kept on breaking or something would go wrong. They kept working on the building to try and get it right but continued to fail. They had to make their plans realistic and that was there major problem.	1	1		1																					
5709	6	The buiders faced many obstacles. They could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat surface it took alot of stress and hard work. The dirigible was held by a single cable tether and the dirigible was about a thousand feet. That made the builders very stressed and made them think clearly and carefully about the wind pressure and also the dirigibles load.	1	2		2																					
5710	6	There were a few problems with the dirigibles docking on the empire state Building. One problem would be the foundation. If dirigibles were to land on the building it would cause tension on the buildings foundation, @CAPS1 squishing it down. The architects would need to have made adjustments to the Foundation in order for a dirigible to land. Another problem was the way the ship would be docked. when the ship would be docked, it would be a hazard because it would sway back and forth around the mast. Either causing damage or injury to people of New York.	2	2		2																					
5711	6	Dirigibles, blimps, were being hailed as the transportation of the future in the 1920s. They had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling.One obstacle the builders faced was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith spotted the opportunity for his Empire State building. He was to add a mooring mast to the top of the building, thus allowing dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service. Also, it would let people off and on.The problem with this was that the builders couldn't just set the mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof if a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the structure, held by a single cable tether, it would add stress to the buildings frame.	1	2		2																					
5716	6	The  builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A @NUM1 foot dirigible would add stress to the buildings Frame. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable. The acciedent of Hindenburg also raised alarm. Hindenburg set fire on Lakehurst in New Jersey. This showed the builders how much worse the acciedent could have been if it had happened over a densely populated area, such as New York. Another factor were the wind currents. They were constantly @CAPS1. This would cause the back Of the dirigible to sway and move about. There was also a preexisting law stating that airships could not fly too low over urban areas. These are some of the reasons obstacles the builders fased in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5723	6	"Based on the excerpt the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was that a ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building held by single cable tether would add stress to the buildings frame."" This is a very important obstacle because of the frame becomes to stressed by excess wait of the dirigible the building might collapse. another obstacle is wind. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This is also a major obtacle because the dirigibles were very light lighter than air so the violent winds would swing it arond that high in the air is not a safe thing especially considering that downtown @CAPS1 is below were there are thousands of people. And a third obstacle was the Law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal to fly that low, to be able to tie the blimp up to the building."	3	3		3																					
5724	6	What the builders are faced with while trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, one of them was nature. The winds at the top of the building were always shifting cause of violent air currents. Even if they were able to tie the front of the dirigibles to the building the cable that is holding it will cause pressure to the building. They only way you could have the building not have pressure on it was to modify the building so it can get stronger that would cost over sixty thousand dollars. Even if they were able to get around all these obstacles there is a law against airships flying to low over the city. So either way it would not have been able to happen.	3	3		3																					
5728	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted there were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock there. The dirigibles also called blimps were very big, this was a problem because they were to large and could not get to the building and ""most dirigible outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (par. @NUM1) This is bad because an accident could occur and the blimp could explode right over the city and hurt thousands of people The winds above the building were sometimes violent and it was hard for dirigibles to reach it, ""Even if the dirigible tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (par. @NUM2) It was difficult attempting to allow dirigibles dock the Empire State Building. The purpose in which the top of the building was created could not be used because it was to dangerous."	3	3		3																					
5729	6	"In the making of the Empire Building the builders faced some problems. All of these problems or negative for what they actually wanted to do. Some of these problems were because of what the balloon was made of. Most balloons used hydrogen instead of helium. In the excerpt they say ""hydrogen is highly flammable"" which could cause many deaths. Also another was strong winds that could carry the balloon and be hard to handle. Last situation would be that there is a law about low-flying vehicles and the balloon flys low. In conclusion the problems they had could not be fixed, so the plan was ruined."	2	2		2																					
5732	6	In the excerpt  The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that it was strictly hard for architects to drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire Building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the buildings frame. Many dilemmas and complications the builders faced. Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings frame work.	2	2		2																					
5733	6	The builder of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of these problems, (that was noticed after building of the Mooring Mast), was how difficult it would be to keep a blimp steady and attached to something without pulling the building over on itself. Another issue was safety and one thing that was unsafe about it was that most dirigibles from other countries use hydrogen instead of helium, which is very flammable. One more reason was because of high air currents that would blow the back part of the ship around uncontrollably.	2	2		2																					
5745	6	The obstacles that builders faced while building the Empire State Building was, first the buildings structure was not strong enough, the winds were too strong, and the law. The buildings structure could not hold a @NUM1 foot dirigible. The winds would make the dirigible move, which could also ruin the frame of the building. Also the law said that the airships could not fly too low over a city. That was some of the obstacles that the workers faced while building the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
5748	6	The Empire State Building faced @CAPS1 difficulties to have the dirigibles to dock there. Wind pressure from the dirigibles messed up the buildings frame work. To accommodate the situation they paid Over Sixty thousand dollars to strengthen the buildings framework.	1	1		1																					
5752	6	"In the excerpt, ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building. First they had to make sure that the mast wasn't too heavy to put on top of the building and when they realized it was they made @MONEY1 of modifications to the building so that it could support the mast. They also had to make sure it would be safe, transporting people through this dirigible. It depended on the wind and climate. They also had to make the building taller than the Chrysler building. They wanted to transform New @CAPS1 transportation. In the end, they realized that docking on the building was not possible if they wanted to keep everything safe to the public."	2	2		2																					
5753	6	"In the passage ""The Mooring Mast"" The excerpt went through @CAPS1 obstacles Such as @CAPS2. If the men were not trying to compete the buildings would probably have been okay. If you take your time and real try to reach your goal you can."	0	0		0																					
5761	6	"The obstacles the builders faced in building the Empire State Building were nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe."" The size was a problem along with how high they were in the sky. ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" @CAPS1 were the obstacles."	2	3		3																					
5764	6	Dirigible docking would have been a great addition to the Empire State Building. There were many obsticles the architects had to go through to complete this goal. The building wasn't strong enough. If they had tied a dirigible to the top of the original Empire state bilding, it would have pulled the building untill it feel over. The architects had to upgrade the frame so it was safe. Now that the frame was safe they had to worry about the dirigible itself. If only one end of the dirigible was tied to the mast the other end would blow in the wind. This would make unloding cargo and people very hard. Also dirigibles could catch fire, which wasn't safe. for the people on the ground. In the and it just wasn't safe to dock a dirigible at the Empire State Building.	2	3		3																					
5765	6	While the Empire State Building was being built the builders faced many obstacles. Al Smith, the one in charge of this project, had a goal to build the tallest building. Right of the bat, the first problem occurred. The Chrysler Building had a secret 185-foot spire inside, and made this building now @DATE2, 46 ft taller then the Empire State Building. The first sign of hope shinned apon Al when he saw an opportunity for Empire State Building. Dirigibles needed a landing area. and the mooring mast does the trick. The mast, added to the top of the building, allows dirigibles to anchor For awhile to refuel and to have service done. This design took a while to develop + soon became bad. Saftey was a factor. Most dirigibles, from outside of the @LOCATION2. were run on hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is very flammable and can cause tragic accedents. For example on May 6, 1937 German dirigible was destroyed by fire in New Jersey. If something like that would happen in a heavily populated area like @CAPS1 then there would be a problem. These were a couple of the many obstacles faced while building the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
5770	6	Well the dirigibles were airships flying to low over the city and over urban areas. Also the U.S @ORGANIZATION2 approached the mooring mast to tie up but the winds were to forceful. also a Goodyear Blimp Columbia. Attempted a publicity stunt where it tied up and deliver a bundle of newspapers.	1	1		1																					
5773	6	The obstacles the builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 people faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is they would have to have different make new Routes that was yet to get made and existing transatlantic Routes.	0	0		0																					
5778	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. The dirigibles weren't safe in a city like New York because of violent wind currents at the top of the building that would make the dirigibles ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Also many blimps from outside the United States were filled with hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If there was an accident like the Hindenburg in New York, more than just the passengers would be harmed. Another obstacle was that there was a law forbidding airships to fly too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to even go near the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
5781	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles well attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was the ""violent air-currents."" Due to these currents, it became very hard to be able to allow a dirigible to dock at the top of the empire state building, without blowing away. Another obstacle was safety. The dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, instead of helium. Hydrogen is a very flammable object and if an accident were to happen, a flaming balloon flying over a highly populated area of New York could become very dangerous. Although the idea of making docking stations for dirigibles is a good idea, there are too many obstacles and hazards preventing it from ever happening."	2	2		2																					
5782	6	"The builders faced many obstacles in attempting to ensure that dirigibles could dock at the Empire State Building. For example, the first problem that arose was construction of the mast atop the building. According to the excerpt, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" From this you immediately know that the frame of the Empire State Building would have to be properly modified in order for the dirigible to safely and successfully dock at the mast. Another minor issue was making the whole construction look decorative. ""... the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside..."" @CAPS1, ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS2, the winds at that altitude would have been to unstable for a dirigible to dock. The problem is that the winds could potentially ""swing"" the rear of the dirigible around the mast, which is extremely dangerous and risky."	2	3		3																					
5783	6	"During the construction of the empire state building builders faced many obstacles with attempting to allow a dirigible to dock there. These problems consisted of safety and practical isshues. one safety isshue was that most dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium. hydrogen was more flammable than helium. This led to the hindenburg a german airship to be destroyed by fire. ""most dirigibels from outside the United States uses hydrogen rather that helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" The builders also had practical isshues such as it was illegal to fly a airship to low low over a city. ""the other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas. This made it illegal for a ship to even tie up to the building."" These obstacles stopped the hops landing on a building."	2	3		3																					
5793	6	There are some obstacles the builders face during this time while building the Empire State Building. One of the issues was the unsolved problems of mooring airships to fix a mast at a height desirable to postpone installation to a later date. The Empire State Building wasn't destined to ever fulfill its purpose. For reasons it should have been apparent before it was constructed. And another obstactle was the lack of a suitable landing area.	1	1		1																					
5794	6	"There were Several obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One reason was one of sefty. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" If an accident would occur above a densely populated area, such as New York, it would be catastrophic. Another obsticle was nature itself. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" Another obsticle the builders had was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."	3	2		3																					
5796	6	Builders had many obstacles to overcome when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. One obstacle was the lack of suitable landing area. This obstacle did not stop Al Smith, he saw this as an oppertunity to add a mooring mast at the top of the building so dirigibles could anchor there. This idea caused another obstacle, a mooring mast could not possibley be dropped on top of the roof of the building. The stress of the load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. With this the steel frame of the building would have to be modified and strengthened costing @MONEY1 just to change the framework. In the end this mooring mast to dock dirigibles never came through and archetects should have seen the potential problems in the beginning.	2	3		3																					
5801	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem they faced was that the dirigibles moored to the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame, so the stress of the dirigibles load would have to be transmitted all the way to the foundation. Another problem they faced was that most dirigibles outside the U.S. used highly flammable hydrogen so it would be very bad if one was destroyed by fire above densely populated downtown New York. Also there was already a law against airships flying too low over urban areas, so it would be illegal for a ship to even approach the area.	3	2		2																					
5802	6	The obstacles that the builder's faced were @CAPS1 avoidable. The first obsticle they faced was the @CAPS2 landing space they had. If they had thought a little bit longer they most likey could of figured out a way to overcome that problem. Now a @CAPS3 a couple of obsticles to talked about the fate of the Mast. Everybody including Al Smith should have thought about the safty, it Should have been a first priority. The builder's Should have seen a problem like this coming, with a poor plan to build Something @CAPS4 has everdone before.	1	1		1																					
5804	6	The @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One problem was the law. There was a law in place preventing airships flying too low over urban cities. This made it illegal for airships to tie up to the building or even come close to the area. Another isue they had was that dirigibles were filled with hydrogen, not helium Hydrogen is extremely flammable and it would be catastrophic if a dirigible blew up over New York City. The last problem they @ORGANIZATION1 was the wind. At the top of the building the winds shifted due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigibles were tied up the back end would move around. They got the idea to use lead weights on the back but it would not be safe over all those people.	3	3		3																					
5805	6	The builders of the Empire State building had a grand idea of including a mooring mast where dirigibles, also known as zeppelins or blimps, could dock themselves. Though the idea was good, it provided the builders with many obstacles. For example, when the framework was being built, the mast was going to have to be added to the top. The mast couldn't just be dropped on, however because if a dirigibles were to the moored there, it would put too much stress on the building's framework. This revelation caused them to have to modify the entire framework to make it stronger which was very expensive.Another difficulty the builder's faced, after construction was completed, in allowing dirigibles to dock there was nature. The building was 1,250 feet tall, so the winds up at the top were constantly changing and dangerous, making it difficult for the dirigible remain stationary when moored. Also, something the builders didn't foresee was the laws against blimps flying to low over urban areas. These two challenges ended up making the use of the mooring mast impossible	3	3		3																					
5807	6	Trying to allow dirigibles dock on the Empire State building caused way to many obsticals for the builders. Dirigibles were up too one thousand feet long, this would make it realistically impossible for it to dock because the size of it would add stress to the buildings frame builders would have to reconstruct and make the frame stronger. Most non-@CAPS1 dirigibles are filled with hydrogen and not hellium which I highly flamable if cought fire pedestrians could be seriously hurt. Finding out later they an existing law about airships flying to low which would make it illegal for a dirigible to even fly near the Empire State building	3	2		3																					
5808	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast,"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with many obstacles to allow dirigible's to dock there. What these builders were facing was a thousand foot derigible moored at the top of the building, the height of the Empire State Building is 1,250 ft. Adding the single cable tether would add to much stress to the buildings frame, the workers would need to modify and strengthen the buildings frame. Another problem they didn't realize at first was the wind, from violent air currents. With all these problems that were not easily fixed, eventually the idea of a dirigible at the top of the Empire State Building dissapeared."	2	2		2																					
5809	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" By Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the empire state building faced several obstacles in the attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. One of the obstacles they faced was the fact that there was a lack of suitable landing area. The dirigibles were thought to be able to anchor on the mooring mast for refueling or service, however, another obstacle was in the way; nature. That was the greatest obstacle. The wind at the top of the building were always shifting because of violent air currents. The builders were afraid that the back of the ship would ""swivel around and around the mooring mast"" With that said, they came to a conclusion that they would be ""dangling high above pedestrians on the street [which] was neither practical or safe. In order for it to be safe, they came to another obstacle. The entire building would have to be modified and strengthened with over @NUM1 dollars worth of investment. Lastly, there already stood a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. With all obstacles faced, it was never opened to the public."	3	3		3																					
5812	6	Throughout the excerpt, on trying to build the empire state building; the builders faced a lot of hard attempts trying to build the dock for the dirigibles. One major problem is that the dirigible was not able to land on the buildings flat roof. This was stated in paragraph @NUM1 of the excerpt. Another problem is that they had to design elevators and stairs for the passengers to travel to the top of the building to be able to get on the dirigible. Along with designing stairs they had to be able to build 102 floors just for the area where the blimp would land. This can be supported in paragraph 11 and @NUM2 of the reading. After trying to build the big building, the builders ran into major safety concers towards the end of the making. The builders did not think they would run into any problems or think of the safety.	1	1		1

The article says that ""the stress of the dirigibles load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation"" in order to make docking safe. The mooring mast was composed mostly of steel. Other problems facing architects was the wind factor, and keeping zeppelins immobile in the ""constantly shifting"" and ""violent air currents"" at @NUM2 feet. Safety hazards also came into account, because architects realized that should another accident like the Hindenburg's occur again in New York City, results could be disastrous.

5841	6	"There were many obstacles workers face when building the Empire State Building: making the structure of the tallest in the world, making it serve a greater purpose than being just a building and most of all it had to be stable.Designing and building the tallest structure in the world was quite the @CAPS2 for architect Al Smith, his building had to be taller than the 1,046 foot tall Chrysler Building. The Chrysler building was originally only @NUM1 feet and the Empire State building was planned to be @NUM2 feet. But when the architect of the Chrysler Building revealed a spire that was to be placed on top, the Chrysler Building's height shot up to 1,046 feet, just 46 feet taller than the Empire State. The competition had begun.When Al Smith was constructing a piece to fit on top of the sky-scraping building, he wanted to be ""more than a spire or dome or pyramid put there to add a desired a few feet"" (paragraph @NUM3), he wanted something that would truly awe people. With the popularity of blimps, or dirigibles, on the rise, Smith decided he would create a docking station for them on top of his building. Although, a great deal of effort and frustration proved the task impossible. The main reason being that there was too much margin for error and that chance did not want to be taken with a crowded city of @ORGANIZATION3 below. The tip still being added though, put the Empire State Building at 1,250 feet, @NUM4 feet taller then the Chrysler Building.The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 that the building seems to face was the elements. The monstrous structure had to withstand very high winds. Most of the building was weather proof, the only problem being the top. It was designed to look almost like a rocketship, with four wings at it's base. Lined with steel, th structure still holds today. Most of the challenges faced by the crew building this magnificent structure seemed impossible, but they created the building they set out to build. And it is still the tallest in the world to this day."	1	2		2																					
5842	6	There were three main @CAPS1 that the builders faced: safety, Nature and THE LAW.The first obstacle that they faced was safety. Many blimps used Hydrogen instead of Helium. While Helium is a @CAPS2 gas, Hydrogen is a @CAPS3 which are combustible.The second obstacle they faced was Nature. The @CAPS4 winds blew the Blimps off target and because they weren't aero dynamic, it was @CAPS5 to manever them.The third obstacle was a law that stated that Blimps can't fly too low, so if the other @CAPS1 didn't exist, it would still be illegal.IN conclusion, they Should Have built a @CAPS6 because @CAPS7 are simply better than Blimps.	3	3		3																					
5848	6	"The engineers involved in the creation of the Empire State Building were forced to confront reality when an array of obstacles presented themselves during the time in which the were trying to dock dirigibles. The primary problem was the usefulness of this dock creation. Though this idea was innovative, it was not practical, as dirigibles were never destined to be a popular source of transport. The malfunction in the creation of the idea was its focus. This is because the goal in this work was not to create a successful dock, but to add footage to the building. If the focus had been different, the outcome may have been more rewarding. Technical problems also arose. Based on laws, safety, and practicality it could not function. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen,"" creating an extreme fire hazard in a highly populated place that would transform into a deathtrap. The anchor for the blimp would only secure it at one point allowing the blimp the spin around, dangerously in the wind. Lead weights, the only solution to this, would disrupt pedestrians. There was also an ""existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas,"" making the project completely unpractical. Both attempts at reaching the building failed, displaying the reality of the flaws. Winds and other complications were preventative. All in all, the builders were destined to be unsuccessful with the plethora of flaws in this project."	3	3		3																					
5852	6	The builders of the Empire State Building had many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The number one obstacle was safety. The builders thought to themselves, How are we going to safetly land a dirigible thousands of feet above the ground, while its freely floating in midair? Plus when you attempt this you are above crowded New York streets. If there was ever a malfunction or error while docking then thousands of people may lose their lives. Its much easier lending dirigibles in an open field than in mid-air because you have much more room, your planting the dirigible on secure ground, and you can weigh it down so it doesnt move around. Yet landing in open fields is dangerous because on @DATE1 in @LOCATION2, New Jersey the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by a fire. This example shows how that if that were to happen in mid-air over a crowded New York City street or block then many more casualties would have been recorded. These obstacles were real and these are some of the reasons why the idea of landing a dirigible in mid-air slowly went away, because it wasnt the most logical idea.	1	2		2																					
5861	6	"The workers' constructing the Empire State Building faced many problems while building a dockable mooring mast for dirigibles, two of which were that the winds at that height were unpredictable and foriegn dirigibles using hydrogen instead of helium.

Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This quote shows how unsafe it could be for dirigibles to dock up that high. The high winds could cause loosening of the dirigible which could cause it to go flying off, which is unsafe to the pedestrians. Also, ""Most dirigibles from out side of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) This shows yet another safety hazard the workers ran into. If something were to go wrong the dirigible could catch ablaze and come plummeting down to a large amount of pedestrians.

The next obstacle is dirigibles from outside of the United States. The dirigibles German's use hydrogen which is flammable. They said ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Thats obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigible to dock."	3	3		3																					
5875	6	Based on the exerpt, the obsticles the builders of the Empire State Building faced were all for nothing. They spent extra money to restruture things but there was no need. Even if they found some way to get the dirigibles to dock, it was already illegal for aircraft to fly that close to cities.	1	1		1																					
5876	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building faced a few obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there such as safety, weather, and policies. One of most obvious issues was the safety of the docking. Blimps run on hydrogen, which is highly flammable. If something were to happen while refueling the dirigible, it could potentially cause extreme harm to the densely populated area underneath it. Another stumping factor was the weather at such high altitudes. At 1,250 feet above the ground, the wind is constantly changing directions because of the ""violent air currents"" so high up. Also, it proved to be difficult to tie the blimp because since the winds were so strong, the dirigible could not get close enough to the building. One last obstacle that was apparent was the law that was made stating that airships could not fly low over urban areas. This made the mooring dock illegal if used and made captains of the blimps aware that being so low and close to many buildings makes it challenging and dangerous to dock the dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
5879	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building some obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles included the added, stress to the buildings frame, The excerpt states in paragraph nine ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether would add stress to the building's frame."" This obstacle would could cause the whole building structure to collapse which could cause death and alot of destruction. Another obstacle included nature. The excerpt states in paragraph fourteen ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" These violent air current could cause the dirigibles to lose control and hit the building and other buildings around it. The stress being added to the Empire State building and nature itself were the two main obstacles for the builders."	3	3		3																					
5886	6	"When the builders of the Empire state Building were constructing the mooring mast for the dirigibles, they faced obsticles that could have jeopardized the project. There were two aspects that the builders had to pay extra attention to, structural integrity, and design. Since ""the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Building's flat roof,"" The builders had to modify the building's frame. These modifications cost over @MONEY1. The other aspect that posed an obsticle was design. The architect, John Tauranac, described the plan to make the mast ""more than ornamental,"" and ""more than something as mundane as a water tank. So, to fufill the architect's high aspirations, the builders constructed a ""shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside. This required a lot of extra work for the builders. Dispite the obsticles, the boilders got the job done."	3	1		2																					
5887	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast,, by @PERSON1, the author describes many obstacles builders faceded, to allow dirigibles to dock. The first problemb was the modifications that had to made to the buildings framework. ""Over sixty thousand dollars worth of modifications had to be made,"" showing how expensive this product was going to be. A second potential problemb was that, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting."" This could cause many different complications. One of which would be how ""the wind would blow the dirigible onto sharp spires,"" a consiquence feared by the piolet of Los Angeles. Another problemb brought up by the winds shifting, would be the ship spinnig, potentialy resulting in catastrophe. They acomidated for the use with unpractical things, eventualy leading to the downfall of the mooring mast."	3	3		3																					
5894	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced three main challenges while attempting to make the mooring mast accessible to derigibles. Most foreign derigibles still used hydrogen; a highly flammable gas. A fire on the streets of New York would be disastrous. There were also fierce, ever changing wind currents above the building. These winds would make the back of the dirigible ""swivel around and around the mooring mast."" @CAPS1, there was a law in place preventing dirigibles from flying too low when over urban areas. This law made it illegal for dirigibles to tether to the building or even approach it. Those three factors made the mooring mast ""neither practical nor safe."""	3	3		3																					
5898	6	The obstacles that the builders of The Empire State builduing faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were they had to allow the dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers on or off. The dirigibles were docked by means of electric Winch, Which hauled in a line from the front of the Ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigibles Could Swing in the breeze, and yet passengers Could Safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. They had to go through all these obstacles in order to build The Empire State builduing.	1	0		1																					
5899	6	"Al Smith, a former governor of New York, led the way in constructing the Empire state building. This building was being constructed to be the tallest building, taller than the Chrysler building which stood at @NUM1 feet tall. In order to make the Empire State building taller than the Chrysler building, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast to the top for docking dirigibles. This idea faced many obstacles. First, the passage states that ""The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthen to accommodate this new situation."" This would cost a large amount of money to construct. Also, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States use hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" @CAPS1, the passage states the issue that ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The builders realized many problems after the mooring mast was constructed. The builders should have thought of each situation before building the mast which cost a lot of money. Although the mast was no longer used, the Empire State building still stood at the height of @NUM2 feet, the tallest building built."	3	3		3																					
5900	6	"Builders of the Empire State Building never achieved their goal. They had failed to predict the potential problems that they would face. First of all, they couldn't proceed to attempt to land the dirigible on the Mooring Mast because it would be dangerous. Indeed, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (paragraph @NUM1). They realized the complications it would imply if there were to be an incident like the one in New Jersey. Also, nature was an obstacle to the project; ""The winds on top of the building were constantly changing due to violent air currents"" (paragraph @NUM2). Consequently, due to the winds, the back of the dirigible would be swinging around the mooring mast, which would be a huge danger to the streets. As a final point, dirigibles wouldn't be able to moor at the Empire State Building because there was a pre-existing law concerning how low airships could fly over urban areas."	3	3		3																					
5901	6	The architects didn't realize how many potential problems the mooring mast would bring until it had failed. The greatest reason why the dirigibles couldn't land was purely safety complications. Many dirigibles at the time used hydrogen rather than helium, which is highly flammable. Another main reason was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were very violent and could easily push a dirigible in the wrong direction. Before these problems, there was an already existing law against the flying of airships too low over urban areas. Dirigibles could not dock at the Empire State building because it was unsafe and illegal.	3	3		3																					
5902	6	"In the excerpt the builders of the Empire State Building had many obsticales to deal with. They had to make sure the dirigiles good go high enough and be safe for passengers to board and get off safely. The builders had to deal with alot.""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of @ORGANIZATION1 roof."" Because of the buildings hight they were uable to make things work. The dirigible was too much and it added stress to the buildings frame, to unload things it was to difficult the floor it needed to be on was too low.""The as yet unsolved problems of mooring airships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the Final the final instalation of the landing gear."" The project was so difficult that they had to quit the task and expand at another time. The workers were devistated."	1	2		2																					
5903	6	"There were many problems to over come in the construction of the mooring mast on the Empire State Building. The first problem to over come was the stress a thousand foot long dirigible would add to the buildings frame. This was solved by spending over @MONEY1 in modifying the building's frame work. Another problem was a law against airships flying too low around urban environments, brought up in paragraph @NUM1. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" @CAPS1 is writing about the wind. At 1,250 feet high the wind is violent, and would swing a dirigible around to much to be safe, and ends could not be weighed down for fear of injuring a pedestrian. Those were three signifigant reasons the mooring mast failed."	3	3		3																					
5904	6	In attempting to let dirigibles dock at the Empire State Building the builders faced many problems. The first problem was the fact that most dirigibles from outside of the U.S. used hydrogen instead of helium. The problem with hydrogen is that it is highly flamable and would be a huge risk to have a hydrogen dirigible over a city full of pedestrians because it could catch on fire and hurt them.Secondly, the wins at the height of the Empire State Building were always shifting which presented great risk to pilots. If their dirigible got blown off course it could collide with other tall buildings in the city. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles got blown off course by the strong winds and the pilot could not take his hands off the controls in fear of hitting other buildings.Lastly, there was a pre-existing law that would have made it illegal for a dirigible to have entered the airspace around the Empire State Building.	3	3		3																					
5907	6	In the 1930's this would have been a difficult obstacle to face. the idea altogether was doubted by many People. the first @CAPS1 was comparing in height with the chrysler building. and the mooring mast wold have worked in theory but in reality had to many Problems. It was a potentially dangerous attempt.	0	0		0																					
5923	6	The builders of the @ORGANIZATION1 thought that they had a great idea and that they were pioneers. They soon realized that there were some problems with their ideas. One major problem was safety. As noted in paragraph @NUM1, most @LOCATION3 dirigibles used hydrogen, which was highly flammable. New York is one of the biggest cities in the United States, and it was far too densely populated to take that risk. Another problem was wind. At those heights, the wind currents were unpredictable and winds reached high speed. If the dirigible were to be blown around while in the downtown area and were to hit a spire of the building, there would certainly be quite a few casualties. After the risks and rewards were balanced, they realized it just wasn't worth it.	2	3		3																					
5926	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" written by Marcia Amidon l�sted she explained the challenges dirigibles faced when trying to dock to the Empire state building. The @CAPS1 had to take into account the obstacles of the make up of dirigibles, the building structure and weather conditions when attempting to create a landing area for dirigibles. A mooring mast on the top of the Empire State Building could never be functional. Dirigibles must be lighter than air to fly. Gases such as helium and hydrogen are used to make blimps less dense. Being highly flamable, hydrogen could easily create a massive fire. The owners of the Empire State Building, decided if the blimp ever caught on fire it would be a much larger disaster over an area with a large population. Another factor that halted the docking of dirigibles was the building structure. The docking of a dirigible adds extra stress to the Empire State Building. The @CAPS1 were forced to design the framework of the building so it was strong enough to not collapse under the extra pressure. This took time and ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications hat to be made to the buildings frame work"". Lastly weather conditions tested the @CAPS1, on the top of the Empire State Buildings the winds are quite unpredictabled. They often shift because of ""violent air current"". No matter how the builder tie the dirigible to the mast the blimp will be unsafe. Due to winds, and structure of the building as well as blimp, the @CAPS1 couldn't create a docking area for dirigibles on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
5927	6	work face many problems with building docks for dirigibles to land on docks attched to the Empire State building. In paragraph @NUM1 it states that dirigibles disappeared and did become the transportation of the future. The Empire State building Never got to forfill its purposes for dirigibles.	1	0		1																					
5935	6	The obstacles that were faced by the Empire State Building builders were numerous. First of all, if they had carried out their plans for the mooring mast without taking into account the weight of the dirigible, the building would surely have way too much stress forced on the foundation when it docked. Next, the fact that the dirigible weighs even less than air is both a negative and a positive. The negative side to it is the fierce winds that would take control of the back of the dirigible. Above the many pedestrians in the city, this idea was quickly ruled unsafe. Lastly, it was filled with hydrogen, which, naturally, is highly flammable. The use of hydrogen was very dangerous, and only added to the negative side of the project.	3	3		3																					
5942	6	"In paragraph 6 it said ""New York City was the lack of a suitable Landing space"" Another obstanke in paragraph @NUM1 was the Nature it self the winds was push the dirigible around in the back of it. The other obstakle was in paragraph @NUM2 the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These are the problem that the Empire builders faced"	2	2		2																					
5952	6	Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. So the one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He said a mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the ship and then tied it to a mast so by swinging the body the passengers could safely get on and off.	0	2		0																					
5953	6	The problems that the workers had to face in letting the dirigibles dock at the empire state Building were crusal & @CAPS1 Because first if they would of tried to Put Mooring Mast on the top of the Building Roof And then have A thousand pound Dirigible on top of It holdn @CAPS2 would be to Much for it to hold. And the stress of the dirigible's weight and wind pressure will need to be transmitted to the Buildings foundation which was 11 hundred feet Below The frame of the Building would have to be stronger Modified @CAPS3 it could work But it would be Over @MONEY1 to Put into the Building frame work in order for it to succeed But the Most Reason why it was difficult for the workers is Because of the winds And if landed they would need weights to weigh it down but it would be dangling high above Pedestrians witch wasn't Practical or Safe.	2	3		3																					
5957	6	"The obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the building were lack of area, populated area, and hydrogen is highly flammable. ""Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air."" Hydrogen is very dangerous and it's flammable and Empire State Building is located in a populated area, so it's dangerous to risk. Also as German dirigible ""Hindenburg"" was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, it proved to the owners of Empire State Building that it's more dangerous than it looks. Other reason why dirigibles couldn't moor at the top of the building was the existing law agains all airships flying too low over populated areas."	2	3		3																					
5958	6	"In the excerp ""The Mooring Mast"", by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. They had to come up with a safe plan which included building designs and figure out problems they failed to see from the begginning.The first obstacle was meeting with the navy and other experts to come up with a safe and practical plan. They had to find a way to land the dirigibles without adding stress to the buildings frame and without spending @MONEY1 to strengthen it. The builders came up with a plan that included what the mast would have to be made of and what wold be on each floor. They even had to finish the roor before the mooring mast cold take place.The largest obstacle was one they failed to see from the beginning. In building the mooring mast, they would have to face obstacles that nature brought, which was simply impossible. Safety was the main problem. if a fire occurred, there would be a disaster. The winds were too strong due to violent air currents and there was a law prohibiting airships from flying too low. After all this work, they couldn't get passed the obstacles, and the mooring mast was never built."	3	3		3																					
5968	6	They had to build the tower just right or els there would be landing problems if they added the sight seeing thing People would pay any price but the price of keeping it stable was not worth the effort. In the end the people were like going to make this a very popular thing but it was not up to them if it was or wasnot popular Wind and Landing always stood in there way so they paid alot-o-money to restableise the building. This ended up being a profit and ride of a lifetime	1	1		1																					
5970	6	The builders of the Empire state building encoutered obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Dirigibles were said to be hailed as the transportation of the future, however in New York City there was lack of a suitable landing area. The speed at which dirigibles traveled and the area and heights wind speed became unquestionable. The dirigible plan became more and more unreasonable with an accident occurring in @LOCATION2. For the height, wind, speed, and location, using dirigibles was no longer a good idea	2	1		2																					
5979	6	In this short passage, it discusses how architects want to build a mooring mast on the Empire State Building in the state of New York. This mast would dock dirigibles, which in modern day they're called blimps. The mooring mast is a skinny tower at the top of the Empire State Building to dock the Dirigibles. Empire State Building stands @NUM1 feet tall without the mooring mast at peak.The stress of a dirigible on a mooring mast at @NUM2 feet is a lot of weight at that high of a structure. They put @MONEY1 of modifications into this deal for the base area of the building.An important downfall about the dirigibles are that with helium in them, they're very flammable and could cost several millions in damage. If the zeppelin caught on flame over such a densely populated land area, that could take a large amount of lives.I think the mooring mast was a great idea and it helped the building be the tallest building at one time. They should still use the mooring mast today.	2	3		3																					
5986	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced by attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were harsh. The builders, in theory, thought everything would work perfectly. They had to face that they did not do enough to see if there would be any problems with having the dirigibles dock there. As I read I noticed the building never fulfilled it's purpose. This was because most dirigibles from outside of the united states used hydrogen, not helium, hydrogen is very flammable. On May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse a fire could have been if it were to happen above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. So in reality this idea was not safe and the builders had to go through building it, having it all done. Then realizing the idea was not pursuable.	1	2		2																					
5996	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced a few problems. First, they had to figure out a practical way this could be done. When they decided to construct a ""rocket-shaped mast"" that the dirigible could attach to, they realized that the roof had to be built first. After the building of the mast was completed, saftey became an issue. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United states used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable."" (paragraph @NUM1) If there were ever an accident with a foreign dirigible, the safety of New York City would be at risk. Also, the dirigibles could not be tied down with weights like they can in an open field. This would also be unsafe for the people of New York. The main obstacle the builders faced with saftey, which is a big issue. Therefore, the dirigibles could not dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
5997	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders faced one giant obstacle. They faced the risk of blowing up the building. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) This is one example from the excerpt that could turn into the biggest obstacle. If one were to explode above this building then the building would die. Also a lot of people would die from it too. That is one of the biggest obstacles they faced."	1	1		1

The last obstacle the builders were faced with was the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law made it illegal for ships to ever tie up or approach a building in that area.The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but in the end Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes...	3	3		3																					
6017	6	"Architects and builders faced several obstacles when attempting to build the empire state building and allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was S keeping a safe environment. Dirigibles that are fueled by hydrogen are prone to be destroyed by fire. One example of this is in paragraph @NUM1, ""the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey."" Another major obstacle was high wind speeds and violent air currents. These made dangerous because the back of the ship would be swung around the mooring mast. Lastly, another obstacle that they faced was a law. In paragraph @NUM2, it says, ""an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This law would keep dirigibles from being able to ever dock there or even fly in the general area. All of these obstacles could not be overcome so in the end the mooring mast was not successful."	3	3		3																					
6018	6	"There were a lot of obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, they wanted to add more hight to the Empire State Building so it can be, ""equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation dream"" @PERSON1 said. Next, Al Smith wanted to add a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State Building so it can allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. ""Over sixty thousand dollar's worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Then they, ""designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself."" Also, ""the rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at it's corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arms"". The roof had to be completed before the mask can take place. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of mooring mast was nature itself. In conclusion, those were the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
6019	6	"It is within our obligations as human beings to have dreams and want to convert them into reality. Al Smith's dream of having dirigibles land on the empire state building is one I'd consider to be rather erratic. There were many obstacles that proved from early on, the fate of this project was failure.       It is apparent from very early into the constructions that this was surreal because ""the one obstacle to their expanded life in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"" (paragraph 6). Having dirigibles cruising through a large city should have been perceivably impossible to Al Smith, even before the construction of the building occurred.     Safety was also something to be seriously taken into consideration since ""most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" which also intertwined with the laws of objects flying too low over an urban area (paragraph @NUM1)."	2	2		2																					
6020	6	The firsts obstacles was to make the Empire State building the worlds tallest building by adding a top or a hat to make the building a little more taller. And second obstacle was to drop people from the mooring mast to the Empire State building's flat roof.	1	1		1																					
6022	6	The obstacles the builders would have to face would be things such as structural @CAPS1, and worrying about future technological advances. Even if they found out how to land a dirigible on the platform, what about advances on them or new transportation methods. The structural @CAPS1 was a quick fix, by reinforcing the supports to the building itself.	1	1		1																					
6026	6	The task of allowing dirigibles to dock on The Empire State Building was met with many obstacles. The fist one to come into play was the support of the building. The dirigible's load and the wind pressure would greatly reduse the stability of the building. Over sixty thousand dollars' went into modifications of the building's framework.Another problem was the dirigibles themselfs. Most dirigibles coming from outside of the United States were filled with hydrogen. As seen in the tragic Hindenburg inncodent, hydrogen is highly flammable. The owners of the Empire State Building concluded that an accadent such as this would be even more devastaing over a densly populated area. After being faced with all these obstacles, the idea of dirigibles docking atop the Empire State Building was put to rest for the safety of the people.	2	3		3																					
6030	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced a lot of obstacles when trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. A big problem with safety: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Another reason was when dirigibles moored in open landing fields, they could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building would not work out due to the highly populated New York and dangling over pedestrians.Another reason was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even aproach the area. Even if it could, there was worries that the dirigible would be punctured by other obstacles on surrounding buildings.	3	3		3																					
6035	6	"In the excerpt the obstacles the @CAPS1 of the Empire State Building face in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the ""lack of a suitable landing area"".

This ""would swing in the breeze and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking gangplank to an open observation platform."" The biggest obstacle, @CAPS1 of the Empire State building was to ""nature itself"" which meant that dirigibles moored in open landing fields, where they would be high above pedestrians on the street where it was neither practical nor safe. @CAPS1 of the Empire State attempted these causes to allow dirigibles to enter on the property of the Empire State Building!"	2	3		3																					
6038	6	"The builders of the empire State building faced many obstacles in the making of the mast. The first obstacle was that of the buildings stability. The excerpt states ""The steel frame of the empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened"". This shows that in order for the mast to even be built the structure of the entire building would need to be altered to accomidate the use of the mast. The second obstacle they faced, in the actual use of the mast, was nature. In hopes of docking the dirigibles to the mast, mother nature would not allow it, as it @CAPS1 in the excerpt, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" They also warned that with those air currents the passengers would not make it off of th dirigible safely due to the end of the dirigible floating rapidly undocked. They feared that if they docked the end it would be unsafe to the pedestrians below just as the helium in the dirigible would of as well."	3	3		3

To fix the problem, over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building. Another problem was that some dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium. Hydrogen is highly flammable which would be very dangerous to have over a densely populated area. The ""greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" By this, L�sted means that there are many violent air currents at the top of the building, meaning that the ship would swivel around and around. To make sure this would not happen, lead wieghts would have to be used which would not be practical or safe to have ""dangling high above pedestrians."" In the end, people realized there were far too many problems involved in the use of a mooring mast at the top of the Empire State building."	3	3		3																					
6046	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Also it would be over @MONEY1' worth of modifications. The builders also faced the obstacle of safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium, and hydrogen is flammable, so it wouldn't be safe. ""... an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.""

6049	6	"Based on the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. These obstacles include the weather, safety, previous dirigible tragety, and the law.The wind at the top of the Empire State building was a huge safty hazard because even if the dirigible was secured the back would swing a cause a potential hazzard due to the unpredictable winds. To fly a dirigible they are filled with hydrogen instead of helium, this is also dangerous because hydrogen is very flammable. On May, 6, 1937 the hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, @LOCATION3, so the owners took into consideration this could have been much worse if the accident had taken place above a densely populated area such as New York. Dirigibles are very unsafe so this created many obsticles for the builders of the Empire State Building to allow dirigible to dock there."	3	3		3																					
6051	6	In the excerpt there were multiple obstacles the builders faced when allowing dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. First was making the steel frame of the building stronger. The builders also had to make the empire state building 102 stories tall, and make the 101st story an observatory. The last obstacle the faced was building the empire state building. Those are the obstacles that the builders faced when construction the empire state building.	1	1		1																					
6056	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allowing dirgibles to dock there. One obstacle was the wind at the top of the building. The winds there were ""constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it dangerous for a dirigible to stop there. Another obstacle was a law against flying dirigibles over cities. The law made it ""illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". Since they were banned from doing this, no pilot would ever more there. A third obstacle was the decreasing use of dirigibles.  With the Hindenburg incident on May 6, 1937 and the increasing use of airplanes, not many people few on airships anymore. In conclusion, several obstacles prevented the docking of dirgibles to the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
6058	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were comprehended to late. First they had to figure out a way to go about this, but they also needed government officials to agree that it's a safe way to execute Al's plan. The roof couldn't be flat, so they had to create something else for it to land on. But the dirigible being held on by one cable ""would add stress to the buildings frame"" and would be sent down all the way to it's foundation, which means they would have to modify their model of what the Empire State building was going to be. But one of the worst obstacles the builders had to face was the fact that dirigibles are highly flammable. And their are many people and other building in @CAPS1 that could be put in danger. Also the weather takes a toll on how the dirigibles going to act in the air, if it's rough it could cause major safety problems. There was and has been a law restricting airships from ""flying too low over urban areas."" @CAPS2 much, this idea was over from the start, but no one took the time to realize."	2	4		3																					
6061	6	"When attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building, the builders faced obstacles regarding laws, safety, and even the nature of the mast itself. There was a law at the time prohibiting aircraft from flying low over cities. In paragraph @NUM1, the narrator says, ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area"". This did not stop some dirigibles from attempting it, but it was too dangerous around other buildings. The next obstacle was about safety. From the excerpt, ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammible"". An incident like that with the Hindenburg over a city like New York would be devastating. The third obstacle was that the mast was simply not suited for holding a dirigible. The narrator points out, ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"". There was no practical way to hold the back end of the dirigible. In light of all these issues, builders were forced to admit that the mooring mast on the Empire State Building was indeed destined to fail."	3	2		3																					
6063	6	While dirigibles were being invented in the early 1930's. Many workers and financial men and women faced problems when trying to dock dirigibles. A dirigible was a live propeller that passengers who boarded the dirigible could ride. It was a closed compartment under the balloon. Getting back to the point of these inventions. Dirigibles were a dangerous device from what the passage says. From outside the United states they used hydrogen, not helium. The cause affect in using hydrogen is that it is highly flammable. The German dirigible... named Hindenburg, exploded by the cause of fire on May 6, 1937 in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Dirigibles was a very dangerous device back used in the 1930's. So then by the late 1930's, the idea of wing transportational diribles faded away. Later on they took passengers baggage of dirigible and made it into the world's largest soda fountain and tea garden.	1	1		1																					
6068	6	Some obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was the law, and the spires that were on other buildings. Another problem was making the mooring mast. this was a problem because it whould add alot of stress to the building, And safety was an issue. I said that the law restricted this Because you can't Put a Blimp over urban areas because if some thing goes wrong alot of pedestrians will be killed. Putting up the mooring mast was no easy task it was very hard to make it to support a Blimp Because there will be to much pressure on the building. lastly safety there were Blimps that caught fire because of the gases they worked with. If that were to happen in New York alot of innocent lives will be gone.	3	3		3																					
6069	6	"The builders faced many different obstacles in their attempt to allowing Blimps to dock there. There were two major obstacles. ""The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly @CAPS1"" (@NUM1). If a blimp had an accident like the Hindenburg, not only would the Empire State building go down, it would affect other buildings and people too because of the city's population. Lastly the other large effect on the building was the weather. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM2). The winds could have easily knock it over with a blimp attatched to it for this reason: ""the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast"" (@NUM2). As result to this the blimb would be so close to the mast that if a strong enoungh wind was blowing, the blimps weight you take the mast with it. All in all weather and hydrogen blimps with the builders' two major obstacles."	3	3		3																					
6070	6	The problems that the builders of the empire state building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were the issues of safety. As said in paragraph @NUM1 the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Also said in paragraph @NUM1 there would be lead weights dangling above pedestrians on the street. one other problem they faced were the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas.	3	2		3																					
6074	6	"In the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""The Mooring MASt"" by @ORGANIZATION2, The builders of the empire state building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle to their expanded use in new york city was the lack of a suitable landing area. Another obstacle was getin the passengers on and off the dirigbles safley. In conclusion I have showend the obstacles that the builders have faced on the @ORGANIZATION1."	2	2		2																					
6075	6	"There were many obstacles builders needed to face to make it possible for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building. First was the stress that would be put on the entire building if a dirigible was attached to a mast at the top. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way through to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below."" (@NUM1) This problem was easily solved by strengthening the frame of the building. Another major problem was the wind 1,250 feet in the air the wind blows very hard and violently. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast."" (@NUM2) The wind combined with the fact that a dirigible was filled with hydrogen made a bad combination. Hyrogen is a very combustible gas and if a dirigible ran into the building and there was a spark the entire mass of the ship would be enflamed."	3	3		3																					
6079	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges trying to allow dirigibles to dock there. The challenges ranged from nature itself to laws against it. They didn't take into consideration the constantly shifting air atop the building. At such heights as the moring mast violent air currents would cause the dirigible to swivel around the mooring mast. This was also due to the fact that the blimp would only be tethered in the front. Not only were those large factors coming into play but laws also came in the way of dirigibles mooring at the Empire State. They didn't think about the existing law. It stated that air ships flying to low or over urban areas was against the law. So many factors came into play with building such a project. Overall it was too far fetch of an idea.	2	3		3																					
6085	6	The builders of the empire state building ran into a lot of problems involving the dirigibles.  One problem is that there was no easy way to make such a suitable docking station at such a great height, while making it look good.  The other, most main reason/problem with the mast for mooring the dirigibles was just a safety issue.  But a big one.  Most dirigibles used hydrogen instead of helium and hydrogen is extremely flammable.  So, if something were to go wrong with docking the dirigible could catch fire and explode & go down in a densely populated area.  There were a lot of safety and structure issues but they were eventually resolved, (like the fact that large lead weights needed to dangle over the streets to weigh down the back of the dirigible	1	2		2																					
6086	6	"In attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building @CAPS1 had to face many obsticals. Alot of obsticals were straightforward and not ecnoliged By the @CAPS1 for example ON page three @CAPS2 @NUM1 and @NUM2 and it says that is was ""unsafe Because the dirigibles were filled with Hydrogen"" wich is Highly flammable. there were @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4 Because of them Being flammable the german Dirigible Hindenburg was Destroyed By fire. there was also violent air currents and a law against air ships flying too low over urban areas"	2	2		2																					
6089	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building had a few obstacles to face when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, as written by Marcia Amidon L�sted in the,The Mooring Mast. Al Smith, the architect of the Empire State Building, didn't want his masterpiece to be only for show, so he gave it purpose; a dock for dirigibles. By adding a comma ""thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether,"" the buildings frame would be under much stress; ultimately making the structure unsafe. To alter the frame and wind pressure, over @MONEY1 would need to be accumulated. If an accident were to take place, like in Lakehurst, New Jersey, the densely populated city would be in grave danger. Although these obstacles can be overcome, the obstacle of mother nature herself, cannot."	2	3		3																					
6093	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced several obstacles in their attempts to allow dirigibles to dock there. The builders ""main obstacle were the wind currents the dirigibles had to face in trying to dock nearly eleven hundred feet in the air. The harsh winds at the top of the building were constantly changing because of the air currents. The U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles could not even get close enough to tie up to the mast. ""The captain could not even take his hands off the control levers"" (L�sted @NUM1) in fear the outer shell would be punctured by the mast. Additionally, if a dirigible was tied to the mast, it would moving all around the mast based on the unpredictable air currents. However, safety was also a major factor. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable"" (L�sted @NUM2). Therefore, attempting to tie dirigibles to the mast of the Empire State Building was very unsafe, as the obstacles the builders faced were simply too much to overcome."	3	2		3																					
6094	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles, also known as blimps, to dock there. The initial problem was that the blimp couldn't land on a flat surface. So the builders made a ""mooring mast"" so blimps could be connected by electrical winch to the building. But this caused problems too. They couldn't just drop the mooring mast on top of the building or it would be unstable. But most importantly since the winds kept changing it would never stay still. The problem of foreign blimps using hydrogen rather than helium made it to dangerouse to the public. In conclusion The builders of the Empire State Building faced many challenges in trying to let blimps dock."	3	3		3																					
6099	6	"In their quest to allow dirigibles to dock, the architects and builders of the Empire State Building ran into many problems. One of the more obvious issues was that of the make-up of the dirigibles themselves. At the time, they consisted of hydrogen, which, although allowed for a lower density, was highly flammable. This concept was proven and brought to light by the 1937 crash of the ""Hindenburg"", a famous dirigible. If a dirigible were to catch fire while docking at the Empire State Building, it would surely crash onto the civilians below. Another topic of debate for the architects of the Empire State Building was the issue of high winds at the estimated 1,250 foot altitude of the mooring mast. Such winds could easily cause a lack of stability for a dirigible which could in turn place added stress on the building itself. Another problem caused by winds is the fact that the dirigible might crash into other buildings, causing, the fabric containing the hydrogen gas to be punctured, and the dirigible to crash. In the end, it was a project deemed too risky to continue."	3	3		3																					
6105	6	"There were multiple obstacles that made the idea of docking dirigibles foolhardy from the start. ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire..."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) the idea of such a volatile object over the population became far more of a threat than a luxury. Lead weights needed to support the craft could not be supplied, and would also prove to be hazardous. Given the Empire State Building's nature, the modifications became hasselsome and added unnecessary difficulty. The winds at that altitude would also provide docking issues and instability. Finally, the airplane overtook the blimp, because it could travel faster and hold the same, if not more, number of people in a small area. Blimps became dangerous and cumbersome, and would not benefit New York as Al Smith had hoped."	2	2		2																					
6110	6	"THE BUILDERS OBSTACLE IN LETTING DIRIGIBLES DOCK AT THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING WAS ALOT. FOR ONE THE MOORING MAST WOULD ADD STRESS TO THE BUILDINGS FRAME, THE WEIGHT OF THE DIRIGIBLES AND WIND PRESSURE WOULD BE TRANSMITTED TO THE BUILDINGS FOUNDATION. ""WINDS WERE SHIFTING DUE TO VIOLENT AIR CURRENTS"". ""EVEN IF THE DIRIGIBLES WERE TETHERED TO THE MAST THE BACK OF THE SHIPS WOULD SWIVEL AROUND."" AND ALSO THE LAW THAT AIR SHIPS CANT FLY LOW IN URBAN AREAS. "	3	2		3																					
6116	6	"In the excerpt from ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. ""The stress of the dirigibles load into the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below"" is understood in paragraph nine. This was the biggest obstacle the builders had to face. The builders developed a plan of ""Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from the inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. Although the mast was finished due to @CAPS1 Nature a new law no dirigibles has ever docked at the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
6117	6	"As a result of the idea to build a mooring mast, the builder faced a few obstacles in construction the mast. The first problem was structural, the weight of the dirigible tied it with a single tie would put great stress on the building. It was said between the dirigible's load and wind pressure the stress would be distributed all the way to foundation of the building. Another obstacle was the safety. Many dirigibles outside the United States used Hydrogen instead of Helium which is highly flamable. The owners realized the ""Hindenburg"" incident and realized the effects it could of had on downtown New York. The final obstacle was nature because the winds shifted at the top of the building. The problem discussed on this was despite the dirigibles being tied, it could swivel around the mast. The many obstacles faced led to the mooring mast not being constructed to its full purpose and blimps were less commodly used."	3	3		3																					
6118	6	"The Empire state building is one of the greatest symbols of the United States. With the world trade center destroyed, it stands as the city's highest building. Many are familiar with its famous spire at its summit, but few actually know why it's there. The truth is that it was meant to be a mooring dock for dirigibles, or zeppelins, balloons lined with steel that were equipped with propellers for steering.          The sad truth is that it never happened. According to the article ""The Mooring Mast"", the environmental conditions as well as safety condition, were too poor to accommodate. Apprently, the wind currents at such a high altitude are fears, and if a blimp were to be tethered to the top, quite a great deal of strain would be placed on the building frame. This is time-consuming and costly to fix. Also, there would be no practical way to weigh down the baloon without the risk of the falling on civilians. Not only that, but having air ships that low over urban areas was illegal. In short, the whole idea was wishful thinking, because it couldn't have happened."	3	3		3																					
6119	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles to allow dirigibles to dock there. For instance, in paragraph @NUM1 it talks about the Hindenburg bursting into flames over New Jersey + how much dangerous it would of been over a highly- populated areas such as New York.	2	1		2																					
6122	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to land there. One major obstacle was safety, mainly because when foreign dirigibles flew in, they most likely contained hydrogen (highly flammable). After the Hindenburg crash they were more wary if something like that happened in a densely populated area. An unstoppable obstacle to the builders was nature; with the vicious winds getting tied up in releasing passengers would be hard enough. According to the article lead weights were used to land dirigibles in open land on crappy weather, but the builders didn't use them, so there was no chance of it falling and hitting someone. Through all this trouble the builders still had the most practical problem; ""law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" With this issue it was illegal to have a dirigible tied up on the Empire State Building so close to the ground. In conclusion, even though the mooring mast never worked out as planned, the builders went through looking at obstacles just for the thought."	3	3		3																					
6124	6	The obstacles the builder of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are, The govenment people in Washington was think about some safe way of mooring airships of the mast. He never wanted to reach the top cause he don't want an accident to happen and than something happen. The wind on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The weights of the build, it would be dangling high above pedestrian on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. It was also a law.	1	2		2																					
6125	6	Right from the start, the Empire State Building had architectural demands that posed several obstacles for the builders of it, especially when it came to building the mooring mast for dirigibles. Initially, the Empire State Building was built only for inside use, so the mast would add stress to the buildings frame and possibly damage it. Secondly, the Empire State Building was built in a very densely populated area so if any malfunctions were to occur such as the Hindenburg in 1937, many people could be killed down below. Another problem posed to the mooring mast was nature itself. Winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, and they were very strong as well so any dirigible mounting on the building was threatened by swiveling and flying off when landing. The masters in the architectural era had made a true mistake when they planned the construction of the Empire State Building, and it never could have reached its potential for many obvious reasons.	3	3		3																					
6127	6	The builders faced some problems such as weather conditions. The winds were violent from changing wind currents. Another was the law of how close an aircraft could be to a building. Another problem was the building had to be strong enough to hold a blimp in place. The builders would have to strengthen the buildings skeleton in order for it to work. This they did. Another problem is some foreign Blimps are made with hydrogen. This makes them highly flamable. With others made of helium. The hydrogen could catch fire and fall onto pedestrians. These are the problems they faced.	3	2		3																					
6136	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced when trying to allow dirigibles to land there. One is that the weight of the zeppelin, when tied down to the building, would put immense pressure on the framework and the pressure even would have reached the foundation. The cost of reworking the frame work to make it safer would have been @MONEY1. Another obstacle was public expectations. The Building was supposed to change how we travel forever, all while being a beautiful, magnificent structure. Surely the pressure to build the tallest tower in the world got to them. These expectations were so unreal because most people didn't know enough to understand the safety risk involved.	1	2		2																					
6138	6	"The Empire State Building at the time it was being built was designed to be the tallest building in the world. However this was not an easy task. The workers had one especially difficult obstacle overcome, @CAPS1 dirigibles, or blimps, to dock there. The plan was to build a mooring mast on top of the building which would allow dirigibles to dock. If this could be achieved it was said to make the Empire State Building, ""equipped for an age of transportation..."" However many problems occurred. The dirigibles weight would have to be able to be held safely. The architects knew the weight would put stress on the buildings frame. The workers had to modify and strengthen the buildings framework. The workers also built the mast out of a strong, shiny, chrome-nickel. Another obstacle was faced when the mast was taken in consideration. The framework was originally stopped at the eighty-fifth floor. The workers had to finish the roof before the mast could be framed. Although the workers succeeded on making a safe mast, the ""Aviation Pioneers Dream"" never came to be."	2	3		3																					
6139	6	"Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building. He wanted to add a mooring mast to the top of the building so that dirigibles could anchor there for refueling or service and let people on and off. In order to do this, the steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be ""modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation."" They would have to spend over sixty thousand dollars in modifications of the framework. Builders had to make it 102 floors and also create a glassed-in observation area along with an open observation platform, furthermore, they had to complete the roof and then move on to building the steel mast with glass windows. After all that time and money spent in re-creating the building, the dirigibles couldn't dock there. The wind was so strong that the back of the ship would always be moving. Also, there is a law that airships cant fly too low over urban areas. It wasn't worth it in the end."	2	3		3																					
6143	6	When the Empire State Building was built, new ideas came into the heads of the architects. Unfortunately, the vision that they had of making it into @NUM1 dock for limps proved to be unrealistic.The first challenge that they came across was how to attach a dock for a blimp to the building without creating such stress to the building's framework. The building could potentially collapse with the added weight unless sixty thousand dollars' worth of framework strengthening was made.Another obstacle that the architects faced was nature. At the top of the Empire State Building, winds were so strong that the blimps would be swaying too violently to allow for the pilots to dock them safely. The last reason that blimps could not be docked at the Empire State Building was that there were laws against aircraft's flying that low. It was actually consitered illigal to dock the blimp there because it would have to be flying low enough to approach the building. Due to these factors, the Empire State Building was unable to become a dock to support blimps.	3	3		3																					
6145	6	The obstacles the builders faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building were building a mast, dirigibles docking on top of the building, and a law for dirigibles. The architects and builders spend a lot of time building the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building. Dirigibles were trying to figure out how to dock to the building yet most dirigibles failed. A law the dirigibles were unable to dock on urban areas in case of a problem within the dirigibles. These were the obstacles the builders faced in an attempt to create a mast and allowing dirigibles to dock on top of the Empire State Building.	2	2		2																					
6151	6	"Some of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety, nature and the law. One of the greatest obstacle was safety. Since blimps needed to be lighter than air, most are filled with helium or hydrogen. ""Most dirigibles from outside the @LOCATION1 used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable."" This is a big obstacle because if the blimp is high off the ground of @CAPS1 and then catches on fire, that could end badly another obstacle was nature; due to violent air currents' which made buildings sway. This is also bad because if the blimp moves or the building sways into the building than one or the other could break. The last obstacle was the law, which was against 'airships flying too low over urban areas'. So if they did build the mast, it would be even illegal to get a dirigible close. So those are some obstacles builders faced in building the Empire State building to dock blimps."	3	3		3																					
6160	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the Empire State Building faced some obstacles while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. To begin with, one of the greatest obstacle was the act of nature. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"", this made it hard for the dirigible to have a safer landing. The other obstacle was that there was a law, that went against airships flying low over urban areas. In conclusion, the mooring mast of the Empire State Building was not use for landing airship such as the dirigible because it was to dangireous. In addition, they used the mooring mast for other safe purpuses."	2	2		2																					
6163	6	The Empire State building is known as the worlds tallest building. The building is located in New York. Al Smith the head of building the Empire State building, added a top or a hat to the building, that made the building be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. The Empire State building was equipped for transportation. The transportation was dirigible, or zeppelin. The Empire State building had a mooring mast at its top for docking the new airships. An obstacle that the Building faced was New York's lack of a suitable landing area. Al seen an opportunity to get people to and from the Empire state building. Al seen it as something creative and new. The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was never fulfilled. No thought of safety was thought about before constructing the idea either. The greatest reason was most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium which is a higher @CAPS1 for flames. Also nature itself was a big problem the idea had safety problems and couldnt @CAPS1 flames in Downtown New York	2	3		3																					
6170	6	"While builders tried to figure out a way for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building, there were some obstacles faced. If a dirigible was held by a single cable, this would add stress to the building's frame. The dirigible would have to be cabled at the top which was also difficult because of the Empire State's flat roof. Also weather was a huge obstacle. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1, line @NUM2) The wind would cause the dirigible to sway and not be very stable. Builders had to also keep in mind that using the building could be harmful to pedestrians as well, the dirigibles would be too close to the ground. The planning of where these aircrafts to land and re-fill was not an easy task for the builders."	3	2		3																					
6171	6	"In the excerpt, The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, nature, unsafe docking conditions and pre-existing laws against dirigibles were just a few obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced. The main obstacle ""to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself"". On the top of a building so high the wind is always switching directions which would cause the dirigible to ""swivel around"". Blimps or dirigibles always landed in open fields and could be weighted down with lead weights, but using this technique ""where they would be dangling high above pedestrians... was neither practical nor safe"". The builders of the Empire State Building also came across ""an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas"". Now this law made it illegal for any airship to dock or tie up to the building. Attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building was neither safe, practical or legal."	3	3		3																					
6173	6	"The future of transportation is a matter that any architect has discussed at one point. Whether reality is taken into account, that is another subject. Al Smith had the challenge of make the dream of docking dirigibles, into a reality. Although Smith had high hopes for the project, many obstacles stood in the way of the construction of the dock. One problem is stated in paragraph fourteen, ""the greatest obstacle to a sucsesful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" Wind power was not taken into account at the time, and neither was the fact that thousands of people in downtown New York are put in danger. In conclusion, dirigibles soon became much more useless with the spark of the airplane and soon died along with the dreams of the mooring mast.Another problem that stood in the way was a law stating, that airships cannot fly to close to urban areas. This destroyed any plans of the mast because not only was it risky to build, but it was also illegal. What was once a glimphs of the future soon turned into nothing as @PERSON1 finally confronted the public in saying that the construction will be post-poned. The future of transportation took a sharp blow, but with the new succession of the airplane, anything seemed possible."	3	2		3																					
6177	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The first, it says the building's foundation will be more stress with a thousand-foot dirigible docking. For example ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" The second, it says that it's really dangerous if they take place above the building. For example, ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. ""@CAPS1, it says the winds on the top of the building are so strong. For example ""The winds on the top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents.

In conclusion, they still face to many obstacles, so the idea which let the dirigibles dock on the top of the building is hardly become true. "	3	3		3																					
6182	6	"When the architects behind the mooring Mast of the Empire State Building first began there work in designing it, they did not take into account the @CAPS1 that they would have to overcome to dock a dirigible. In the excerpt it States that the mooring mast was not originally part of the design structure for the Empire State Building: however the stresses it would cause in docking a dirigible ""would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation."" This means that the builders would need to design Some way of doing this when the building was already begun. Other @CAPS1 included those of safety. The exerpt tells that ""most dirigibles from outside the U.S. used hydrogen"" which is more flammable than helium. This combined with the fact that there really was no way of securing the tale of a dirigible moored at the mast could cause an accident @CAPS2 to that of the Hindenburg over a ""densely populated area Such as downtown New York"""	2	3		3																					
6185	6	"In the excerpt, ""the mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the empire State building faced some obsticles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obsticle was that in order to build it for docking dirigibles, they had to spend over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the buildings framework. Also, another obsticle was because of the safety. Dirigibles were not that safe, they were flameable and would be over an area with many other buildings and people around. Those are a few obsticles that the builders of the empire State building faced in attempting to allow the docking of dirigibles."	2	2		2																					
6186	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by author @ORGANIZATION2, the builders of the Empire State Building faced some obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. A first obstacle the builders faced was the concern of the building collapein over time with ""all the weight of the dirigibles. They would have to spend more money and time to create a frame for the Empire State Building to support the dirigibles."" @CAPS1 @NUM1 supports that obstacle ""a thousand foot dirigible moored at the top of the building would add stress to the buildings frame"". A second obstacle builders of the Empire State Building came upon on attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the building was the concerns of the thousands of citizen just below the tall building. After german dirigible was on fire in Jersey they realized how serious they situation can become. ""Owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse it that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" These were two of the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced."	3	3		3																					
6196	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock thousands of feet above the New York streets. One of their many problems was the sheer size of the dirigibles, somewhere as long as one-thousand feet. Another problem they faced was keeping the back of the ship from swiveling around the mooring mast. Usually, the backs of these blimp-like structure's were anchored down by lead weights, but to have lead weights dangling high above the streets was way to risky not to mention unpractical.	2	2		2																					
6199	6	The obstacals he had was that the problems where never really solved and that had caused problems with the wind.	0	1		1																					
6202	6	There were many problems and obstacles that the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, such as nature itself. At @NUM1 ft. the winds were just too strong and unpredictable to get close to and dock a dirigible. On top of nature, laws prevented the landing. Airships could not fly low over urban areas so even attempting to approach the area would be illegal. This idea still posed a great deal of potential danger even if there were no laws against it and wind didn't exist. Many dirigibles were made using hydrogen, which is highly flammable. In such a highly populated area as New York City if one were to catch fire the damage would be horrifying. I hope Al Smith was willing to pay thousands of dollars for the title of world's tallest building because he didn't get his mast	3	3		3																					
6207	6	"There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle was how much stress would be put on the buildings frame. L�sted says, ""A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building's frame. The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation, which was nearly eleven feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. If the Empire state building was going to make this happen they would have to change the frame of it. This was a top obstacle to overcome. Also an obstacle they would have to face was peoples safety. ""Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. If they were to make this happen there would always be the risk of someone catching on fire. Making the Empire State building a dock would have many obstacles to overcome if they wanted to make this happen."	3	3		3																					
6214	6	There were many obstacles for the builders of the mast attempting to allow dirigibles to dock, such as laws, nature, and overlooked detail. Laws were an obstacle because of safety risks of having a dirigible over a densely populated area, such as the Hindenburg accident. Nature was a problem because of the violent winds at the top of the mast, which would make the ship unsteady. The last obstacle was that the builders of the mast overlooked all the other obstacles, and safety risks.	2	2		2																					
6215	6	the mooring mast of the empire state Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have apparent before it was ever constructed the greatest reason was one of safety must dirigibles From outside of the united states used hydrogen. hydrogen rather Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken Place above densely populated area such as downtown New York	2	1		2																					
6224	6	"In the excerpt @ORGANIZATION2, written by @ORGANIZATION1, The builders of the empire State building face obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock There, ""one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of suitable landing areas."" (paragraph 6). If the Dirigibles can't lead it could cause destruction and could be very dangerous to people. In paragraph @NUM1 Al Smith says, It's on level all right no kidding wer'e working on the thing right now."" This shows the readers that the way he words things sounds almost unreliable. When constructing the idea of Dirigibles a mooring mast had to be added to the top of the building to allow passengers on and off. However This idea was unsafe. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using Empire State building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on street was neither practical nor safe."" (paragraph @NUM2). This unsafe why would the build something harmful to others. In the excerpt The Mooring Mast written by @ORGANIZATION1. The builders have a hard time constructing the dirigibles."	2	2		2																					
6226	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in the attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, ""The architect could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof"". A thousand-foot diriglble tethed by a single caple would add to much stress to the building's frame. ""The stress of the dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation. If not the Empire State Building might fall over. For the Empire State Building to take the extra load the architect would have to modify and strengthen the building's existing framework. Also the ornate mast would be difficult to raise on top of the Empire State build due to the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". If the dirigible was tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the dirigible would swivel around and around the mooring mast. If this happened the dirigible would crash into the Empire State Building or other building. This would be bad for the people on the street. Where dirigible's usually land are in open fields. The dirigible could be weighted down in the back with a lead weight. But on top of the Empire State Building dangling weights above pedestrians was neither practical nor safe. Also laws were passed restricting a dirigible from getting to close to a building."	3	3		3																					
6230	6	They get good idea to make that building, but the problems were always big, make plan, design. That was so difficult to make that building.	0	0		0																					
6231	6	Many obstacles were established for the workers, in allowing dirigibles dock on the Empire State Building. At first they thought they knew what they were doing, they were wrong. The workers first obstacle was to make docking at the Empire State building safe. However it was hard to make that happen because it was above civilians and if it ever dropped the resolt would be extremely serious. The second obstacle that got in their way was the wind pressure. It would of caused an un reliable support of the mast which would screw up the docking of the dirigible. Finally the dirigible is the last peice to the puzzle with disaster. In the section The Fate of The Mast it gives that the dirigible is run on hydrogen which is extremely flammable. Just that sentence alone establishes that it is not safe for the enviroment. By far many obstacles got in the way of the process of the mast. But docking was a whole different idea. Many obstacles had gotten in the way of the builders in attempting dirigibles to dock there.	3	2		3																					
6233	6	"To the Empire State building did have a flat roof but they cannot just drop the mooring mast on top of the roof because it would add stressed to the frame. To build a mooring mast the cost would be more than sixty thousand dollars. Building a mooring mast would not be easy because the wind on top of the Empire state building would constantly change direction; therefore the dirigibles would be swirling around."" Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe"". Then there was a law that air craft should not fly too low over urban areas. ""The other practical reason why dirigibles could not more at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" For dirigibles to land on top of the Empire State Building had many obstacles."	3	3		3																					
6236	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 faced @CAPS2 of problems.

6240	6	The obstacles builders of the Empire State Building faced was many things surrounding safety and money issues. Successfully docking the dirigible would mean spending over @MONEY1 more, to make arrangements to the building. Also, there were many safety problems such as the gas the dirigible carried, the danger of people below in the city, and it was against the law for airships to be flying so low.	2	2		2																					
6243	6	Although the mooring mast due to hoist at the top of the Empire State Building was a well thought out plan, it provided some obstacles for builders. The biggest problem was safety. Most dirigibles used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is a highly flammable product. If an accident, such as fire, occurred at the Empire State mooring mast it wouldn't be safe to take place around millions of people such as New York City. Another factor affecting building was nature. The winds above were constantly shifting due to currents. The only way to tie down the dirigibles would be to use weights, but that would also be extremely unsafe to be hanging above a city of people. The last issue was an existing law that prevented airships from flying to low in urban areas. This law makes it illegal for ships to even attempt to tie to the building, therefore it made it nearly impossible for builders to work.	3	3		3																					
6244	6	"In the excerpt ""The Mooring Mast"" by Marcia Amidon @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building were faced with some big obstacles. One obstacle was they had to make sure that the Dirigibles could dock safely. They had to be sure that the passengers could get off and on safely. Lastly they had to be sure the building would not collapse when they made the mooring mast. These examples shows that the builders were faced with many obstacles when building the Empire State Building."	1	2		2																					
6247	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. Al Smith (four-term governor of New York who headed efforts to construct the Empire State Building) was determined to outstrip the height of the Chrysler Building ""The architect building the Chrysler Building however had a trick up his sleeve."" He built a 185-foot spire and hoisted it to the top of the @ORGANIZATION1 was determined to outstrip the height by placing a mooring mast at the top of the building. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof."" The winds would be constantly shifting the mast. ""But using these at the @ORGANIZATION3, where they would be clanging high above pedestrians on the street was neither practical nor safe."" Dirigibles couldn't dock at the Empire State Building also due to a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This made it illegal for ships to ever tie up to the building. In conclusion, builders of the Empire State bulding faced obstacles when allowing dirigibles to dock there."	2	2		2																					
6255	6	The obstacles, the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there is that Al Smith constructed 185 foot spire inside the building to make it taller. By @DATE1's the new airships called dirigibles was hailed as transportation for the future. They was like blimps but was filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter. In New york city they had a lack of Suitable landing area for dirigibles. Al smith add a mooring mast to the top of the building so they could tie the line from infront of the ship.	1	1		1																					
6260	6	The Mooring Mast has two obstacles @CAPS1 the winds on top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other reason dirigibles could not moor at the @ORGANIZATION1 law against airship flying too low over urban area. They try to get close but they can't because of forceful winds. In nineteen thirty the @ORGANIZATION3 dirigible Los Angeles approched the mooring but not get close. So they stablish a low to a securit for a urban Area.	2	2		2																					
6262	6	"Builders in The Mooring @CAPS1 by @ORGANIZATION2 face many obstacles when working to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building. In order to ensure safety and eliminate problems involving the stress load and pressure of the dirigible on the building, the building would need ""to be modified and strengthened to accommodate"" the blimps, and these modification would cost up to sixty thousand dollars. Many of the blimps were filled with hydrogen, an extremly flammable substance that could put the building and the City of New York in great danger if a dirigible was to blow up. Because winds ""on the top of the building are constantly shifting due to violent air currents,"" there was difficulty controling dirigibles and keeping blimps still to keep passengers safe. There was also a law against the height of airships in urban areas. Using the mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building would result in breaking the law since the Mast was too low. These difficult obstacles proved too difficult to overcome. as the mast is not seriously used by dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
6271	6	some of the obstacles the builders went throw was that they had to make many changes, such as they could not just drop a mast on top of the Buildings flat roof. The blimp would give the building stress held by a single cable. the blimps load and pressure from the wind would have to be transmitted all the way to the buildings foundation. The @CAPS1 could have to be strengthened to accommodate this new situation. over sixty thousands of dollars for the new frame work.	2	2		2																					
6274	6	Al Smith had a vision; to create a site for modern travel. Smith faced many obstacles and persisted with hard efforts in attempt to bring his vision to life. The stress of a thousand foot dirigible would have been to much pressure for the original framework of the Empire State Building. Over @MONEY1 worth of changes had to be made to strengthen the buildings framework. In addition the builders had designed a mast the would be rocket-shaped, made with aluminum, which could accomadate the mooring arm, and the control machienery would be in the shaft; housing elevators and stairs for passengers on the dirigible. Another obstacle they had to face was the lack of floors that would serve as a boarding area for the passengers. They had begun to build additinoal floors with a glassed-in observation area and a boarding area. Although the mooring mast for the dirigibles was a fiasco, Al Smith and many architects tried to make all the modifications they could have to fulfill Smith's vision for what he thought was the Empire State Building's destiny	2	2		2																					
6278	6	The obstacles the buildes of the empire state building faced were that they had to make it strong. Also they had to be sure that the dirigibles wouldn't destroy the building when it landed. they also had to care ful that the dirigbles would crash in to the building when it was droping off the papers. An other obstacle for the workes was that the driagbles would not be able to land easily. Finally, they would have to make sure that nothing is out of place and working.	1	1		1																					
6280	6	The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles especially with the construction of the mooring mast due to the height of the building. First, due to the alleged, projected height of the mast there were concerns on how to evenly distribute the dirigible's weight. The structure of the dirigible and the fact that it was lighter than air was crucial to understand. Taking this into account, the builders had to figure out how to have the whole building support the dirigible's weight and not just the top mast. Had the dirigible be supported by only the mast itself, the dirigible's weight would probably pulled the mast right out of the building. Another obstacle the builders faced was the delicate nature of the mooring mast. The mast was not made in a business fashion, but more of an extravagant manner, with much of it made out of glass because of many windows. This made the mast's installation a lot more harder because they had to watch the mast be installed from all areas. The builders faced many obstacles in making sure that the Empire State Building was acceptable for dirigible docking.	2	2		2																					
6281	6	"When faced with the prospect of building the tallest building in the world, Al Smith refused to give up. In order to achieve his goal, he decided to build a Dirigible docking mast atop his new creation. But with this genius idea came obstacle after obstacle, preventing the idea from ever taking flight. One obstacle faced by Al Smith, and by far the greatest, was safety. Most non-American Dirigibles used hydrogen within their Dirigibles, which is highly flammable. The owners of the empire state building realized how bad it would have been if a fiery explosion happened ""above a densely populated area such as downtown New York"". Another great obstacle was nature itself. ""the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"". This made it impossible for the Dirigible to be tethered without the back of ship swireling around the mooring mast."	3	2		3																					
6282	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there were safety issues, nature itself, and the law.     Safety was a big issue when it came to dirigibles docking over a populated areas such as New York City. ""Most dirigibles from outside the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and Hydrogen is highly flammable."" After an accident in New Jersey the owners of the Empire State Building realized this accident would have been much worse if it were it New York City.     Nature causes lots of obstacles inlife, like wind which made it very hard to dock a big dirigible. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were teathered to the mooring mast, the back of ship would swivil around."" They would be dangling high above people which would not be safe.     There is a law against airships flying too low over urban areas. ""This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building."" Two dirigibles attempted to reach the building before the law was dropped.     Saftey, nature, and the law kept Al @CAPS1 dream from coming true. These obstacles were the ones the builders faced when trying to allow dirigibles to dock on the Empire State Building."	3	3		3																					
6287	6	Al Smith's idea of making the Empire State Building bigger was a very difficult task. Also tying to make the top of the building a docking area for new airships was difficult. One obstacles the builders faced attempting to create a dock for dirigibles was preventing stress to the buildings frame. If the builders wanted to fix that it will invole the the building's foundation which was eleven hundred feet below. The framework of the building will cost too much money. The stress of the building will come from the dirigibles's load and wind pressure. Another Obstacle that the builders were faced with was the wind. The violent air current would cause the building to constinously shift. They didnt wand to use lead weights because it was to dangerous. because they were dangling high over predestrains. A law that builders had to think about while building this was the law that went against airships flying too low They had many obstacles that the builders had to keep in mind while building the dock.	3	3		3																					
6289	6	Builders faced many problems with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building. The first problem they faced was the wind at the top of the building. When the Navy dirigible Los Angeles tried to dock at the building, the wind wouldn't allow it to get close enough without moving out of control like hitting another building. This made it impossible for the dirigible to dock and so the Los Angeles gave up. Another reason builders faced a problem with with @CAPS1 dirigibles to dock on the empire state building, was that there was a law that said airships were not @CAPS2 to fly low over urban areas. This law would prevent any and all dirigibles from coming near the building and therefore they wouldn't be able to dock.	2	2		2																					
6292	6	There were many obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced such as the high winds, and how they could dock the dirigibles when it is against the law to fly an aircraft to low near urban areas. one obstacle the builders faced was the safety of the dirigibles anchoring above busy streets filled with people and high winds. Most dirigibles out of the United States used hydrogen rather then helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable, so any foreign dirigible that was anchored at the Empire State building would cause a safety issue because the high winds at the top of the building could cause an accident to occur causing the dirigible to blow up and potentially endanger pedestrians. Another obstacle the builders faced is the law that made it illegal for dirigibles to ever dock at building because it was illegal for aircrafts to fly to low near urban areas and it would have been a long process to ever get the government to let them.	3	3		3																					
6305	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles when attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. One obstacle they faced was they to reconstruct the building to add the mast. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommidate this new situation."" @CAPS1 the mast was an obstacle they had to face. Also, the had to face all of the safety requirements. ""Was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed."" After they figured out what could go wrong if they docked dirigibles the original purpose of the mast was not able to be fulfilled. Another obstacle they had to face was testing there plan to dock dirigibles. ""U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up."" The dirigible failed in their attempt and the idea of docking dirigibles disappeared in the late 1930's. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles. "	2	1		2																					
6314	6	Building the Mooring Mast was not an easy task, creating this futureistic design carried alot of problems beside it. Some problems that these builders faced were that Dirigibles can be up to one thousand feet long so they are very heavy and sway in the wind dangerously, it was also against the law for airships to fly at a low level over urban areas, and there were also a great danger of the Dirigible crashing, or catching fire over the densely populated area of New York.Even though these problems almost seem impossible to pass, they were able to fix up some things to make the project seem more realistic. The steel frame of the Empire State building was modified and strengthened so it could support the Dirigibles and wind pressure, but nature had no mercy and would sway the Dirigibles vigourously which was not safe nor practical. They were able to bypass the law and attempt to dock once which didnt end up working out after all. There had already been cases of Dirigibles crashing such as the Hindenburg. But and accident over a densely populated area would be horrific and not practical. Because of these problems and more, the thought of using a Mooring Mast to dock Dirigibles was quitely retired.	3	3		3																					
6316	6	The obstacles the engineers faced were that Of Any @CAPS1 builder. You have to to think About how high is to high wind conditions, sturdiness of the frame, @CAPS2 And payroll for the engineers. Although Al Smith did not run into the @CAPS2 Problems he did have to rethink on the Mooring Mast on if it was agood idea. Putting An @CAPS3 Thousand foot @CAPS4 Dangling from a Building 1,250 feet in the air. Al Smith @CAPS5 a landmark for the U.S. But @CAPS6 Should'nt have put a non-usable Mooring Mast At the top.	1	1		1																					
6318	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was that the had to be modified and strengthened. This cost them over @MONEY1 worth of modifications. They had to make these modifications so the dirigible can dock. All in All, these are the obstacles the builders of the Empire state building face in attempting to allow dirigible to dock.	1	2		2																					
6330	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.  One obstacle that faced the builders was that the dirigibles could not simply land on top of the building.  The thousand foot dirigible would add stress to the frame of the building.  They would have to ""transmit"" the load and the wind pressure to the foundation which was nearly eleven hundred feet below.  The builders had to make over @MONEY1 worth of modifications.  Another reason was nature.  As stated in paragraph @NUM1, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting"".  The dirigible could not be teathered down because the lead weights would be dangling above pedestrians.  A final obstacle was an already existing law.  The law was against airships flying too low over urban areas.  This made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building.  These obstacles destined the mooring mast to never fulfill its purpose."	3	3		3																					
6331	6	"In attempting to dock dirigibles at the Empire State Building, many problems were faced. One problem faced was in paragraph nine where it says, ""A thousand foot dirigible at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building's frame."" If the did build the dirigible dock, the would have to reinforce the whole building so it would not collapse. Another problem faced was, most dirigibles used hydrogen, not helium. Therefore since hydrogen is Flammable they could not take the risk of a dirigible blowing up over a heavily populated area. A more ******* problem was the weather, specifically the wind, at @NUM1 feet. The air currents were so violent, that the dirigible would swivel around the mooring mast. Dirigibles usually land in an open field where they could be anchored by lead. According to the excerpt, dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. Lastly, the most major problem was the law against airships flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM2, the law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. Even through the dirigible dock was a great idea, too many problems were in conflict with the mooring mast for it to go in full effect. On the brighter side, it made the Empire State building the tallest in the world."	3	3		3																					
6332	6	"The builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles dock there. One problem was that they had to strengthen the rest of the building in order to put the mast at the top. This process would be very costly, the author says ""over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications had to be made to the building's framework."" Another problem in the attempt of allowing dirigibles to dock there was the winds at the top of the building. The air currents were very violent that high up. ""Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast,"" therefore it would not be safe for people on the streets of the city. Finally, the laws of the city interfered with the plan for the mooring mast. The law said that it was illegal for an airship to fly too low over urban areas. If the dirigible was able to dock on the mooring mast, it would be breaking this law. The builders of the Empire State Building faced many problems, and their plan never actually followed through."	3	3		3																					
6333	6	The people who built the Empire State Building had many problems building it. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York was the of a suitable landing area. The Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at it's top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come.	2	1		2																					
6334	6	Some of the @CAPS1 the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there are that they were docked by means of an electric winch, wihich houlad in a line from the front of the ship and then tied into the mast. Also the dirigibles body could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and get off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open oservation platform. Finally the architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equiment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey.	1	1		1																					
6335	6	"The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was cost, and saftey. The steel frame of the building would have to be modified, strengthened to fix this new situation and it would cost over @MONEY1. Another obstacle was that most of the countries outside the u.s. use hydrogen which is highly flammable. Another obsacle was ""The winds on top of the building where constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" this made it unsafe. These where some of the mayjor obstacles they had to go through"	3	3		3																					
6337	6	"The future of allowing dirigibles to dock on the top of the Empire State Building became unrealistic when issues of safty came forward and when test runs did not go as planned.

May non-American dirigibles were made up of hydrogen which is much more flammable compared to the United States helium balloons. To avoid a repeat of the explosion of a dirigible L�sted states, ""the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse the accident could have been if it had taken place above.. Downtown New York."" @CAPS1, the winds at the top of the building were to wild to attach a dirigible safely to the top. The author clarifies, ""Even if the dirigibles were thethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around... the back could be weighted down with lead weights, but using these was neither practical nor safe."" This shows that in order to have the ship still enough to be able to moor it was dangerous. Lastly, a law was passed making it impossible to fly close enough to the building to be able to moor. Marcia Amidon L�sted says, ""An existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas."" This makes the possibility of landing a dirigibles on the Empire State Building illegal."	3	3		3																					
6353	6	The obstaclesthat the builders of the Empire state building faced were those of: 1) it was at a height of @NUM1 feet, @NUM2) how would the passengers be able to get on and off, @NUM3) takes a long time to slow down and @NUM4) the building is said to be 102 floors high with an observation deck on the 101st floor and a boarding/observation deck on the 102nd floor for the blimp passengers. some more major obstacles that the builders of the Empire state building had faced were some so intense they are hard to explain those major obstacles were: 1) how to dock the blimps and @NUM2) how many blimps could dock there at one time.	2	0		0																					
6355	6	@CAPS1 were thought of as the future of transportation Also known as blimps @CAPS1 were like ballons except they were steel and had rubbers and propellers to keep control. These steel balloons can ride eighty miles per hour. The main reason why the empire state building couldn't dock these was because most @CAPS1 from outside the united states use hydrogen instead of hellium. Hydrogen is highly flammable and causes accidents.	1	1		1																					
6358	6	"In The Mooring Mast, by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there. The Mast was doomed to fail before it began. The greatest reason the mast never worked was because of safety. The hydrogen, in most dirigibles, is highly flammable. If an accident were to occur, it would happen over down town New York. ""The owners of the Empire State building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it taken place above a densely populated area."" (@CAPS1 @NUM1) Nature itself was one of the greatest obstacles to the successful use of the Mast. Violent air currents and horse winds made it difficult to fly a dirigible near the building. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" (@CAPS1 @NUM2) The Mooring Mast was doomed to fail before they began building it. The greatest reasons for its failure were air currents and safety. The dirigibles were never able to land there."	2	3		3																					
6360	6	"Many obstacles took place while builders of the Empire State building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there. The stress of the blimps docking on the building would be too much. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"". Another problem was that dirigibles were highly flameable and in such a highly populated area of New York it ""was neither practical nor safe"". Laws against airships flying too low over urban areas worked against the idea but two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped."	2	3		3																					
6364	6	There was three main obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, the densely populated area, the violent air currents, and the existing law against airships. First, most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. Since the dock would be above downtown New York, there is a higher risk of the dock blowing up due to the density. Secondly, nature was a great obstacle. There were many winds on top of the building and the wind currents were constantly changing violently, there was a gigantic fear of the dirigible swiveling around and hitting another building. Finally, the dock could never allow a ship to be tied up legally due to the existing law of airships flying too low over urban areas. The dirigible would not be safe, and the entire idea will drop. For these reasons or obstacles, many builders of the Empire state building faced while attempting to allow blimps to dock there.	3	3		3																					
6365	6	"The architects had their hands full when building the addition to the Empire State Building. There were @CAPS1 obstacles that needed to be overcome when they started building such as making sure the dirigibles were safe enough also taking in consideration the winds that are constantly changing. These problems were part of why the plans were put to a hault.Certain weather conditions were a big part of the safety procedures that took place. ""The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself."" The winds would make the ship sway back and forth which would be extremely dangerous. Another problem was that @CAPS1 foreign ships ran on hydrogen which is flamable and that would be a high risk. ""@CAPS1 dirigibles outside the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flamable."	2	2		2																					
6368	6	"Throughout the short story The Mooring Mast, the builders faced many obstacles to complete their vision. For example the workers had to design a mast that would take ""the stress of the dirigible's load"" (@NUM1). The cable at the top was stated to not be able to maintain the stress the dirigible would produce, so the engineers had to develope a new solution to distribute the weight of the dirigible evenly. This cost them time and money due to the massive hight of the empire state building. the architects also had to do extra research to develope the mast. The workers took tours of the U.S. Naval Air Station and met with the president of the airship transport company just so they could be sure the dirigibles would land in a safe secure way. These obsticles had to be faced in order to produce their unrealistic dream."	3	3		3																					
6373	6	"Marcia Amidon L�sted, author of ""The Mooring Mast,"" highlights not only the safety hazards that the Empire State Building builders encountered while attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there, but also a factual aspect dealing with laws and violations that solidified the failure of such transportation. Normally dirigibles would moore in open landing fields and then weighted down to ensure that they would @CAPS1 motionless on the ground, but since the builders of the Empire @CAPS1 Building are tempted to dock dirigibles @NUM1 feet in the air, nature and airspace laws come in to play. The Empire State Building rising 102 floors high was a feat in and of itself; the vision of dirigibles docking at such height by builders was maimed by both the forces of actual nature and legal disputes. The fact that dirigibles would have to dock at the top of the Empire State Building was not approved by nature. the winds in the airspace @NUM1 feet in the air were not only strong but constantly shifting due to violent air currents so forceful that even ""the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles... could not get close enough to tie up. It was too much of a safety hazard and gamble to more a dirigible with winds not cooperating. The most factual and practical problem builders faced with the idea of docking dirigibles atop the Empire State building dealt with a violation of an airspace law. The existing law banned ""air ships from flying too low over urban areas,"" meaning that legally it was a potential safety hazard to direct and dock a dirigible that high in the air. Without certainty for success, the operation of docking dirigibles on the Empire State Building was halted in the late 1930s. Although the builders of the great Empire State Building could build at @NUM1 foot sky scraper the attempt to dock dirigibles upon the building failed mainly because of safety hazards."	3	3		3																					
6375	6	The greatest reason was one of safty: most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium and hydrogen is highly flammable.

6391	6	The Mooring Mast by @ORGANIZATION1, the builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in the attempts of allowing dirigibles, the transportation of the future in the @DATE1's, also known as blimps to dock at the building. The biggest problem was figuring out how to make the mast work.The main obstacle to the use of the mooring mast was nature, since the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting because of strong, violent air currents, the back of the dirigible would turn around and around the mast even when it'll be tied to the mast. It is said in the excerpt that dirigibles moored in open landing fields can be weighted down with the use of lead weights. Because these would be dangling high above people below it would be dangerous, just in case it falls. Also, builders cannot control nature making this the most difficult.Another obstacle was the stress the body frame at the building will receive if the dirigible was held by a single cable tether. The wind pressure and stress would have been too much for the building's foundation. This was solved by modifying the steel frame of the Building to be stronger to keep the building from collapsing.The attempts at allowing dirigibles to more at the building had many obstacles but in the end it was all for nothing because there is a law that is against airships flying too low over urban areas.	3	3		3

6397	6	"In the excerpt the builders had many obstacles on how they could dock dirigibles on top of the Empire State Building. The first problem they had was because of the high winds. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents"" (@NUM1). This was a problem because the winds could cause the dirigibles to crash into the building releasing it's gases. The second obstacle they faced was making the building structure strong enough to tie down the dirigibles. ""The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modifyed and strengthened to accommodate this new situation"" (@NUM2). This was a problem because if they did not strengthen the steel the dirigibles would weaken the building's structure. Those are the main two obstacles that the builders faced when building the Empire State Building @CAPS1 they could dock dirigibles."	3	3		3																					
6401	6	During the construction of the Empire State Building, the world thought that they knew the future of air travel: dirigibles.  In an attempt to keep up with The modern world, Al Smith, lead architect of the Empire State Building, decided top the building with the dirigible docking station.  Unfortunatlley, during the building process, the architects faced many obstacles that stopped them from completing the mooring mast.  One of these problems with the sixty thousand dollars they would have to spend on modifications to the building.  Another was the flamibility of hydrogen the gas used in inflating the ship.  But the biggest obstacle was nature.  The winds that the dirigible would be facing were very strong, and pedestrians on the sidewalk were put at risk by the possibility that the ship would tear off the tether it was tied to and crash.  A final reason for the end of the mooring mast plan was a law that stated that airships couldnt fly too low over urban areas.  Although the mooring mast seemed like a great idea at the time, many obstacles stopped it from having success.	3	3		3																					
6411	6	When builders of the Empire State Building attempted to allow dirigibles to dock there, they faced multiple obstacles. The most important was the issue of safety because the dirigible would cause chaos if it caught on fire. Hydrogen would be too dangerous to use in the dirigible if it could catch fire at any moment.Another obstacle was the speed of the wind at the top of the Empire State Building. There were violent air currents, and these would shift the position of the dirigible if it was docked at the mooring mast. Since the back of the dirigible could not be weighted down because of safety issues, it would swivel around the mooring mast.The last issue was an existing law about airships. They were not allowed to fly at this height, for it was too close to an urban area. This made it illegal to try and dock at the Empire State Building. In fact, they couldn't even approach the area except for the Los Angeles and the Columbia, who were allowed to try before the idea was ruined. Neither could successfully dock, and the idea was finished.	4	3		3																					
6417	6	"In the excerpt The Mooring Mast by Marcia Amidon L�sted, the builders faced many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock over the Empire State Building. If the builder's would want to dock the dirigibles they couldnt because there was no right area to land them. ""... in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area"". Another obstacle was they would have to know the kind of weather because nature it's self can take control. ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents."" The dirigibles if landed on the Empire State Building would be weighed down because in the back would lead weights so, it would weight it down. Another reason that it was an obstacle was because dirigibles used a gas of hydrogen rather than helium and the gas hydrogen is a highly flammable gas that can do a lot of harm if there are passengers present in the dirigibles and could be very dangerous for the Empire State Building."	2	2		2																					
6418	6	"While in the process of building the Empire State Building the workers overcome countless obstacles. Al Smith, the governor of New York, wants to build ""the world's tallest building"" (1). At the same time the Empire State building is being designer the @ORGANIZATION2 building, also in New York, is finishing construction The @ORGANIZATION2 building workers decide they want to challenge the designers of the Empire State Building by secretly building a 185-foot spire and making their building 46 feet taller. This begins a competition between the designers to see who will win the title of the tallest building. Later on, after the Empire State building is built and wins the title of the tallest building, the workers are trying to make it work as a mast for dirigibles the land on. The designers forgot to factor in the safety of landing a dirigible in the middle of a city and the fact that wind is a huge factor in landing the aircraft safely. The idea of the building for acting as a landing for dirigibles is dropped. The Empire State Building *************** "	1	2		2																					
6420	6	"Builders of the Empire State building faced many obstacles in attempting durables be able to dock there. Some of these obstacles weren't caused by the building it self, nature took part of it due to the forceful winds at the height of 1,250 feet it was hard for the pilots of the dirigibles to steer the ship close enough to tie it up. This situation occurred to the @ORGANIZATION2 dirigible ""Los Angeles"" fearing the wind would blow the ship onto Sharp edges or other buildings in the area. Witch would cause the shell to get punctured leading to a disaster the captain failed to attempt to reach the building on december 1930. Another obstacle builders faced was that an existing law against airships flying to low over urban areas witch would put civilians on the street at risk. Another obstacle was not a large enough dirible would put stress on the buildings frame."	3	3		3

6422	6	The people who were attempting to allow dirigibles to dock at the Empire State went through many obstacles. They would first have to modify and strengthened the buildings frame to accommodate this new situation. The architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. After doing all of that work they then found out that the mast of the Empire State building would never work. The greatest reason was saftey. Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used Hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. The biggest obstacle was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the empire state building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. The law made it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area. By the late 1930's the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes.	3	3		3																					
6423	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire state Building faced in attempting to allow dirigles to dock there was because the dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. the architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building's flat roof.	1	1		1																					
6425	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State building faced were that first, the mast designed to go ontop of the Empire State Building was thought up just to make it the worlds tallest building, not because it was necessary, so alot of problems ar ose. This mast was designed to be a dirigible docking station, which, at the time, blimps were very unsafe, and  lacked a suitable landing area so this was thought to be a great opportunity to give them a place anchor for a few hours for refueling, service, and to let passengers on and off. A mooring mast couldn't be simply dropped on top, as it would add stress to the building's frame, so the steel frame had to be modified, and took over sixty thousand dollars' to do so. After Construction took place, it was then decided if an incident, such as the Hindenburg occurred again, it would be much worse over a densely populated area such as downtown New York. But the largest obstacle was nature itself, the winds on top of the building were constantly shifting, due to violent air currents, and although tethered to the mast, the back of the ship would swivel around, the usage of lead weights could solve this problem, but because they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, it was neither practical nor safe. There was also an existing law against air ships flying too low over urban areas.	3	3		3																					
6431	6	The empire State building had to face dangerous condition every day like @CAPS1 winds, heavy lifting, High heights.	1	1		1																					
6436	6	"Everyone would like to jump in a dirigible and transport from one location to the next. Although, there are many challenges the builders faced in attempt to doing so. One of these challenges included the amount of stress the single cable tether from the dirigible would add to the building. Also, wind pressure is a dangerous factor which needed to be taken into consideration, because the dirigible is so heavy, that it could easily fly off and hit someone. The building would also have to be strengthened to hold the dirigible which would cost over sixty thousand dollars. One of the most important reasons against allowing the dirigible to dock there is because it could easily catch on fire."" The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is very flammable."" (para @NUM1) Overall, due to the dangerous factors in allowing the dririgible to dock there, these will always override the pros, and maybe one day technology can create a safe way to do so."	3	3		3																					
6448	6	"Based on the excerpt, the builders of the Empire State Building faced many obstacles in attempting to allow drigibles to dock there. ""The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State building's flat roof."" That was struggle number one, a thousand-foot drigible would add too much stress to the frame. ""The stress of the drigibles load and as the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building's foundation."" That was another obstacle the builder's had to overcome considering the foundation was eleven hundred feet below. The Empire State building then had to be strengthened and modified in order to build a stronger foundation for the mooring of a drigible upon the Empire State Building. Those were some of the many obstacles the builder's went through in designing the mast."	3	3		3																					
6451	6	The obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there was a thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building. Because it was held by a Single Cable tether that would add Stress to the buildings frame. Another obstacle was that dirigible's load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted to the Building's foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. Even though, the steel frame of the Empire State Building had to be modified and Strengthened to accommodate this new Situation. Overall, this cost over sixty thousand dollars' worth of modifications.	2	1		2																					
6455	6	The @CAPS1 says the greatest obstacle would be nature itself. The wind would blow the blimps on to the Sharp spires of other buildings.	1	1		1																					
6459	6	"While constructing the Empire State Building, the builders were faced with many obstacles in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there One such obstacle that the builders had overcome was the law that prevented airships (i.e. plains or dirigibles) from flying too low over urban areas. In paragraph @NUM1, we learn that ""[this law] would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area."" Another obstacle the building crew of the Empire State Building was faced with when constructing the mooring mast was nature itself. Because of the violent wind currents near the top of the building, the way the wind blew constantly changed, causing a great difficulty for any dirigible to connect to the mast properly. In paragraph @NUM2, we are told about how if it were possible to connect the mast to a dirigible that the back would swing. ""Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighed down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the Street, was neither practical or safe."" Because there were too many obstacles with not enough safe options, the mooring mast project were shut down; proving that during its construction its builders were faced with too many obstacles."	3	3		3																					
6461	6	"There were many obstacles which the builders of the mooring mast had to face. They thought it was going to be an easy task to accomplish as shown in paragraph eight where Al Smith was asked about the mooring mast and he responded ""[It's] on the level, all right. No kidding. We're working on the thing now."" This shows how truly sure Smith was about the goal's simplicity.Although determination was a great factor in the building of this world wide known monument, problems kept standing in the way of success. For example in paragraph @NUM1 the author describes how the Empire State building would not be able to fulfill it's purpose, even though workers should've known better. She states ""When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York."" @CAPS1 kept pooring down, one of them being nature.Finally the workers gave up after the project was postpone due to mainly safety reasons. By the late 1930's, the idea of the mooring mast had almost disappeared. All that really matters is that they tried, and all it took was just one dream."	2	2		2																					
6474	6	"The builders of the Empire State building faced some obstacles in there attempt to allow dirigibles to dock there. A problem they had was the violent winds blowing the blimp around at a high altitude, with people onboard, ""The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting,"". Another set back was it being illegal to fly an aircraft that low, it was ""illegal for ship to tie up to a building,"". Also it was dangerous for dirigibles that ran on hydrogen to dock because hydrogen is highly flammable. The Mooring Mask of the Empire State Building became nothing More than an attraction for sightseers."	2	3		3
